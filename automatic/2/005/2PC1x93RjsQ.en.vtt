00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
was escapes me but that badge is really

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.609 
was escapes me but that badge is really
complicated<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.480> I'd

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
complicated as you can see I'd

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.540 
complicated as you can see I'd
definitely<00:00:22.619> will<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.100> able<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
definitely will not be able to do that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.630 
definitely will not be able to do that
within<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.090> fatal<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.080> limit<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> black<00:00:26.340> ops<00:00:26.430> 2

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
within the fatal a limit of black ops 2

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.490 
within the fatal a limit of black ops 2
but<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.230> show

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
but what I do here is I'm going to show

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.810 
but what I do here is I'm going to show
you<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.680> making<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.429> gonna<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> as

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you just making it I'm gonna make it as

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.429 
you just making it I'm gonna make it as
close<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> possible<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.720> possibly<00:00:31.230> can

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
close to as a possible we possibly can

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.370 
close to as a possible we possibly can
and<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> circle<00:00:34.230> over

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and now you can see that the circle over

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
and now you can see that the circle over
there<00:00:34.559> according<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> squared<00:00:35.489> squares

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there according to the squared squares

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
there according to the squared squares
on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> screen<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.410> three<00:00:37.739> off<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> bottom

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
on the screen it's three off the bottom

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
on the screen it's three off the bottom
two<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> top<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.030> half<00:00:39.149> on

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
two of the top and two and half on

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
two of the top and two and half on
either<00:00:39.329> side<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> clone<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
either side then I get a clone of the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700 
either side then I get a clone of the
circles<00:00:41.489> turn<00:00:42.120> them<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.329> white<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> make

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
circles turn them into white and make

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
circles turn them into white and make
them<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.219> outline<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.120> reduce<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
them as an outline so I can reduce the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.569 
them as an outline so I can reduce the
amount<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> layers<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.890> planning<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
amount of layers that I was planning to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
amount of layers that I was planning to
do<00:00:47.760> originally<00:00:48.090> when<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> did<00:00:48.360> make<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> i<00:00:48.719> did

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
do originally when I did make it i did

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
do originally when I did make it i did
have<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:49.860> too<00:00:49.920> many<00:00:50.100> layers<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.489> daniel

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
have way too many layers and daniel

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
have way too many layers and daniel
managed<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.090> even<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.449> couple<00:00:51.780> stars<00:00:52.079> on

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
managed to get even a couple stars on

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.990 
managed to get even a couple stars on
thing<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.820> another

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
thing but as you can see you get another

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.069 
thing but as you can see you get another
circle<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> solid<00:00:55.620> fill<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:57.079> think

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
circle make it a solid fill and think

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
circle make it a solid fill and think
now<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> work<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.300> sort<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.449> red

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
now is going to work on the sort of red

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
now is going to work on the sort of red
stripes<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.649> I've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.670> quite<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> lot<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.059> your

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
stripes but I've got quite a lot of your

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
stripes but I've got quite a lot of your
requests<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.830> getting<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
requests and they are getting down in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
requests and they are getting down in
there<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.880> looking<00:01:05.939> quite<00:01:06.210> nice<00:01:06.420> some<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
there they're looking quite nice some of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.539 
there they're looking quite nice some of
them<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.290> coming<00:01:07.560> sort<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.979> abstract

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
them are coming sort of more abstract

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.609 
them are coming sort of more abstract
and<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.470> not

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and that's because it's just not

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
and that's because it's just not
possible<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.689> within<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> they

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
possible to make them within that they

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.160 
possible to make them within that they
two<00:01:13.110> layers<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.220> i<00:01:14.460> will<00:01:15.180> try<00:01:15.330> getting<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> make

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
two layers so i will try getting to make

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.749 
two layers so i will try getting to make
all<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.560> i<00:01:16.710> am<00:01:17.070> trying<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> unlock<00:01:17.580> at<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
all of them i am trying to unlock at the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.140 
all of them i am trying to unlock at the
same<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.930> types<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
emblems that are available in black ops

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.179 
emblems that are available in black ops
that's<00:01:22.470> pretty<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.860> i'm<00:01:22.950> doing

if we could probably get around maybe

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.060 
if we could probably get around maybe

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
there was meant to be a hybrid today but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.380 
there was meant to be a hybrid today but
i<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:17.130> i<00:02:17.220> might<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.490> upload<00:02:17.910> three<00:02:18.300> of

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
i think i might just upload three of

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
i think i might just upload three of
these<00:02:18.570> because<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.800> hybrid<00:02:20.190> EA<00:02:20.370> just<00:02:20.640> been

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
these because the hybrid EA just been

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.980 
these because the hybrid EA just been
absolutely<00:02:20.940> irritating<00:02:21.780> me<00:02:21.840> they've

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
absolutely irritating me they've

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.230 
absolutely irritating me they've
disconnected<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.130> from<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> server<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.640> so

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
disconnected me from the server and so

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.880 
disconnected me from the server and so
many<00:02:24.450> times<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.080> i<00:02:25.230> think<00:02:25.470> i<00:02:25.500> said<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
many times and i think i said in the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.500 
many times and i think i said in the
last<00:02:26.250> video<00:02:26.460> where<00:02:26.760> i<00:02:26.820> think<00:02:27.210> i<00:02:27.270> should<00:02:27.390> have

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
last video where i think i should have

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.180 
last video where i think i should have
one<00:02:27.600> division<00:02:27.750> one<00:02:27.960> at<00:02:28.020> least<00:02:28.140> twice<00:02:28.620> or<00:02:28.950> three

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
one division one at least twice or three

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.700 
one division one at least twice or three
times<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.810> I'm<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:30.930> irritated<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
times so I'm really irritated about that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.010 
times so I'm really irritated about that
but<00:02:31.920> whatever<00:02:32.910> gameplay<00:02:33.240> i<00:02:33.270> have<00:02:33.540> got<00:02:33.750> i<00:02:33.870> will

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.610 
can see here getting the middle bit done
and<00:02:40.320> it's<00:02:40.830> all<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> tree<00:02:41.430> inside<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and it's all like a tree inside this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.370 
and it's all like a tree inside this
this<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:43.770> badge<00:02:44.010> inside<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:46.080> tree<00:02:46.290> i

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
this or badge inside so that tree i

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.740 
this or badge inside so that tree i
think<00:02:46.530> if<00:02:46.920> i<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.220> now<00:02:47.460> which<00:02:48.360> lay<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.660> my

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
think if i do that now which lay on my

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.420 
think if i do that now which lay on my
own<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.110> one<00:02:49.890> layer<00:02:50.070> 12<00:02:50.960> get<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> shuriken<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
own I one layer 12 get the shuriken and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.750 
own I one layer 12 get the shuriken and
make<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.000> brown<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:56.190> blue<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
make it brown and the blue I think I

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.420 
make it brown and the blue I think I
used<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.180> 18<00:02:57.540> across<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.050> one<00:02:58.170> down<00:02:58.430> but

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
used is the 18 across in one down but

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.770 
used is the 18 across in one down but
cloning<00:02:59.850> over<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> Shahrukh<00:03:00.270> ins<00:03:00.420> there<00:03:00.570> just

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
cloning over the Shahrukh ins there just

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.060 
cloning over the Shahrukh ins there just
to<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:00.990> those<00:03:01.110> stars<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.530> are<00:03:01.590> inside<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to get those stars that are inside the

to get those stars that are inside the
badge<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:03.270> shown<00:03:03.510> before<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:05.150> just

getting<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.450> positioning<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:07.020> that's

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
getting the positioning I think that's

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.020 
getting the positioning I think that's
five<00:03:07.440> now<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.920> there's<00:03:08.310> seven<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:08.820> in

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
five now this there's seven I think in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.690 
five now this there's seven I think in
the<00:03:09.090> original<00:03:09.300> but<00:03:10.020> why<00:03:10.140> did<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.530> i<00:03:10.560> minus<00:03:11.520> 2

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
the original but why did is I i minus 2

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.360 
the original but why did is I i minus 2
because<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.500> don't<00:03:13.800> want<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.980> go<00:03:14.040> too<00:03:14.100> much

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
because you don't want to go too much

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620 
because you don't want to go too much
into<00:03:14.430> detail<00:03:14.880> especially<00:03:15.060> when<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.450> don't

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
into detail especially when they don't

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.240 
into detail especially when they don't
give<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.870> many<00:03:15.990> layers<00:03:16.170> i<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.860> black

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
give you that many layers i think black

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.440 
give you that many layers i think black
ops<00:03:17.400> 2<00:03:17.550> should<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> feature<00:03:18.120> where<00:03:18.360> they

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
ops 2 should have a feature where they

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.090 
ops 2 should have a feature where they
actually<00:03:18.720> allow<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.140> unlock<00:03:19.800> layers

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
actually allow you to unlock layers

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.700 
actually allow you to unlock layers
where<00:03:20.310> your<00:03:20.430> tummy<00:03:20.610> prestige<00:03:21.440> unlock<00:03:22.440> maybe

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
where your tummy prestige unlock maybe

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.200 
where your tummy prestige unlock maybe
five<00:03:23.280> layers<00:03:23.550> as<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.970> every<00:03:24.120> time

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
five layers as one of that every time

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.580 
five layers as one of that every time
you<00:03:24.270> prestige<00:03:24.510> which<00:03:25.230> would<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.440> actually

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you prestige which would be actually

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.920 
you prestige which would be actually

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
and put it through give it the same

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.150 
and put it through give it the same
color<00:03:43.110> as<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.380> other<00:03:43.560> one<00:03:43.680> or<00:03:43.770> maybe<00:03:43.860> slightly

brighter slightly brighter just to make

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.250 
brighter slightly brighter just to make
it<00:03:45.930> stand<00:03:46.200> out<00:03:46.380> here<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.070> see<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> get<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
it stand out here you see I get the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.470 
it stand out here you see I get the
gunnery<00:03:49.260> sergeant<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:49.920> believe<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.490> give<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.420> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
gunnery sergeant I believe and give it a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.930 
gunnery sergeant I believe and give it a
light<00:03:51.660> blue<00:03:51.900> on<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.680> same<00:03:52.920> what<00:03:53.550> I<00:03:53.580> do<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.760> with

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
light blue on the same what I do is with

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.250 
light blue on the same what I do is with
the<00:03:54.030> colors<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.420> try<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.630> get<00:03:54.810> them<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the colors I try to get them all on the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.390 
the colors I try to get them all on the
same<00:03:55.410> strip<00:03:55.710> so<00:03:55.830> as<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.040> see<00:03:56.190> what<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
same strip so as you can see what the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.130 
same strip so as you can see what the
blue<00:03:56.580> there<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.240> same<00:03:57.450> strip<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
blue there it's on the same strip as the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.750 
blue there it's on the same strip as the
one<00:03:58.650> that's<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:58.890> across<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.400> think<00:03:59.580> its

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
one that's it across so I think its

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.240 
one that's it across so I think its
second<00:04:00.360> from<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.510> bottom<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.870> think<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.250> here

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
second from the bottom I think and here

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.490 
second from the bottom I think and here
making<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.670> little<00:04:03.060> circle<00:04:03.480> putting<00:04:04.440> that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
making the little circle putting that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.080 
making the little circle putting that
one<00:04:04.620> is<00:04:04.770> layer<00:04:04.920> 20<00:04:05.280> make<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.670> a<00:04:05.700> bit<00:04:05.910> earlier

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
one is layer 20 make it a bit earlier

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.850 
one is layer 20 make it a bit earlier
and<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.660> reason<00:04:06.930> because<00:04:07.140> that<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
and the reason because that is a you

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.660 
and the reason because that is a you
gonna<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.070> another<00:04:08.220> circle<00:04:08.610> that's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
gonna have another circle that's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.580 
gonna have another circle that's
overlapping<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.540> what<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.290> do<00:04:10.350> with<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
overlapping it and what I do with that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.410 
overlapping it and what I do with that
one<00:04:10.770> here<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.100> transparencies<00:04:11.640> opacity

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
one here the transparencies opacity

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.210 
one here the transparencies opacity
story<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.660> 80<00:04:12.870> make<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.500> go<00:04:13.590> back<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.770> 100<00:04:14.100> make

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
story is 80 make it go back to 100 make

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.940 
story is 80 make it go back to 100 make
it<00:04:14.250> 80<00:04:14.550> and<00:04:15.080> get<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.170> other<00:04:16.290> one<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.890> gives

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
it 80 and get the other one so it gives

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.460 
it 80 and get the other one so it gives
you<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.160> effect<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.020> ball<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.380> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
you that effect that the ball that you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.680 
you that effect that the ball that you
have<00:04:19.650> on<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.700> front<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.030> standing<00:04:21.390> out<00:04:21.510> and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
have on the front is standing out and

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.720 
have on the front is standing out and
then<00:04:22.290> what<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.500> got<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.130> change<00:04:23.610> your

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
then what you got to do is change your

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.270 
then what you got to do is change your
pasty<00:04:24.030> slightly<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.890> make<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:25.980> look<00:04:26.070> as<00:04:26.220> if

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
pasty slightly and make it look as if

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.560 
pasty slightly and make it look as if
it's<00:04:26.430> sort<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.640> faded<00:04:27.000> as

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
it's sort of faded as

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.330 
it's sort of faded as
into<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.810> background<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.290> then<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.100> go<00:04:29.190> get

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
into the background and then you go get

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.940 
into the background and then you go get
a<00:04:29.370> golf<00:04:29.580> flag<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.060> add<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.720> little<00:04:31.140> red<00:04:31.500> bit

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
a golf flag and add the little red bit

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.630 
a golf flag and add the little red bit
at<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.070> top<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.710> yeah<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.340> was<00:04:35.490> quite

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
at the top so yeah this was quite

can<00:04:59.970> see<00:05:00.060> here<00:05:00.240> making<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.570> tree<00:05:01.010> with<00:05:02.010> in<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
can see here making the tree with in the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.610 
can see here making the tree with in the
middle<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.550> emblem<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.290> making<00:05:04.290> up<00:05:04.380> that

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
middle of the emblem and making up that

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.050 
middle of the emblem and making up that
brown<00:05:04.860> color<00:05:05.160> for<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.490> bottom<00:05:05.760> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.880> tree

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
brown color for the bottom of the tree

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.100 
brown color for the bottom of the tree
and<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.360> think<00:05:06.540> this<00:05:06.630> will<00:05:06.780> give<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.050> the

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
and I think this will give you the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.560 
and I think this will give you the
recommendation<00:05:07.710> if<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:08.610> do<00:05:08.910> have<00:05:09.150> attack

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
recommendation if you do have attack

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.300 
recommendation if you do have attack
dogs<00:05:09.870> as<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.410> can<00:05:10.500> see<00:05:10.680> here<00:05:10.890> I<00:05:10.920> think<00:05:11.160> and<00:05:11.250> the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
dogs as you can see here I think and the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.340 
dogs as you can see here I think and the
original<00:05:11.490> one<00:05:11.760> it's<00:05:11.880> Lions<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.140> can<00:05:13.230> put

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
original one it's Lions but you can put

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.570 
original one it's Lions but you can put
attack<00:05:13.530> dogs<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:13.860> either<00:05:13.950> side<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.460> then

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
attack dogs on either side and then

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.130 
attack dogs on either side and then
reduce<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:14.910> amount<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.450> sugar<00:05:15.630> cones<00:05:15.930> in<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
reduce the amount of sugar cones in the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.290 
reduce the amount of sugar cones in the
middle<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.560> emblem<00:05:16.890> but<00:05:17.730> here<00:05:18.030> giving

getting the original one is 12 or 11 and

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.450

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
because I wanted the actual emblem to

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.200 
because I wanted the actual emblem to
look<00:05:31.410> more<00:05:31.560> like<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.830> badge<00:05:31.980> so<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:32.430> put<00:05:33.060> less

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210

look more like the badge so I put less
stars<00:05:33.480> in<00:05:33.690> but<00:05:33.900> at<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.050> same<00:05:34.170> time<00:05:34.610> giving<00:05:35.610> you

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
stars in but at the same time giving you

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.550 
stars in but at the same time giving you
the<00:05:35.910> more<00:05:36.450> of<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.630> emblem<00:05:37.200> that<00:05:37.290> it<00:05:37.410> looks

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
the more of the emblem that it looks

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.340 
the more of the emblem that it looks
like<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.750> did<00:05:39.750> manage<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.050> getting<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.290> the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
like and did manage to getting of the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.050 
like and did manage to getting of the
writing<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:41.100> actual<00:05:41.370> club<00:05:41.550> inside<00:05:41.880> there

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
writing of the actual club inside there

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.450 
writing of the actual club inside there
but<00:05:42.210> that's<00:05:42.300> because<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.770> club<00:05:44.010> name<00:05:44.250> in

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
but that's because the club name in

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.210 
but that's because the club name in
itself<00:05:44.760> is<00:05:44.970> just<00:05:45.150> very<00:05:45.780> long<00:05:46.020> but<00:05:46.560> hopefully

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
itself is just very long but hopefully
