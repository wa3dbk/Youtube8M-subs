00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.470 
objectives we would discuss are multiply
proper<00:00:19.980> fractions<00:00:20.900> use<00:00:21.900> cancellation

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
proper fractions use cancellation

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.109 
proper fractions use cancellation

multiply mixed numbers divide fractions
and<00:00:27.830> divide<00:00:28.830> mixed<00:00:29.130> numbers<00:00:30.109> let's<00:00:31.109> begin<00:00:31.560> by

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and divide mixed numbers let's begin by

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
and divide mixed numbers let's begin by
doing<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.250> example<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.940> multiplying<00:00:33.360> proper

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
doing an example of multiplying proper

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.580 
doing an example of multiplying proper
fractions<00:00:35.630> let's<00:00:36.630> multiply<00:00:37.040> 5/12<00:00:38.040> times<00:00:38.450> 7/10

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
fractions let's multiply 5/12 times 7/10

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
fractions let's multiply 5/12 times 7/10
we're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> multiply<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.399> numerators

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
we're going to multiply the numerators

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.779 
we're going to multiply the numerators
and<00:00:42.120> multiply<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.140> denominators<00:00:43.800> however

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
and multiply the denominators however

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
and multiply the denominators however
we're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.989> simplify<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.860> cancellation

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
we're going to simplify by cancellation

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.010 
we're going to simplify by cancellation
first<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.660> possible<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.719> five

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
first if possible so we have five

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
first if possible so we have five
twelfths<00:00:53.329> times<00:00:54.350> seven<00:00:55.640> tents<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> will

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
twelfths times seven tents and you will

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.950 
twelfths times seven tents and you will
see<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.559> five<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> factor<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
see that five is a factor of the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
see that five is a factor of the
numerator<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> denominator<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
numerator here and the denominator in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.539 
numerator here and the denominator in
the<00:01:03.239> second<00:01:03.600> fraction<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> divide<00:01:05.280> five

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the second fraction so we divide five

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.990 
the second fraction so we divide five
into<00:01:05.580> five<00:01:06.290> obtaining<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:08.340> divide<00:01:08.640> five

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
into five obtaining one we divide five

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.500 
into five obtaining one we divide five
into<00:01:09.330> ten<00:01:09.770> obtaining<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.240> no

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
into ten obtaining two we have no

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.969 
into ten obtaining two we have no
further<00:01:12.840> com<00:01:13.290> infectors<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.869> multiply<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
further com infectors so we multiply the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.929 
further com infectors so we multiply the
numerator<00:01:17.460> times<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.909> numerator<00:01:19.310> 1<00:01:20.310> times<00:01:20.640> 7

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
numerator times the numerator 1 times 7

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.120 
numerator times the numerator 1 times 7
is<00:01:21.240> 7

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
is 7

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
is 7
multiply<00:01:23.130> denominators<00:01:23.549> times<00:01:24.360> denominator

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
multiply denominators times denominator

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
multiply denominators times denominator
12<00:01:25.409> times<00:01:25.979> 2<00:01:26.420> 24<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.530> obtain<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.250> product<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
12 times 2 24 so we obtain a product of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.100 
12 times 2 24 so we obtain a product of
7<00:01:31.280> 24

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
7 24

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.420 
7 24
no<00:01:34.110> let's<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:34.740> example<00:01:35.070> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
no let's look at an example of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.899 
no let's look at an example of
multiplying<00:01:36.060> mixed<00:01:36.600> numbers<00:01:37.670> let's<00:01:38.670> multiply

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
multiplying mixed numbers let's multiply

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.149 
multiplying mixed numbers let's multiply
3<00:01:39.540> times<00:01:39.900> 1<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> 1/2<00:01:40.799> times<00:01:41.430> 2<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.240> 2/3<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.259> we

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
3 times 1 and 1/2 times 2 and 2/3 and we

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.719 
3 times 1 and 1/2 times 2 and 2/3 and we
will<00:01:44.310> write<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.759> answer<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> lowest<00:01:45.509> terms

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
will write our answer in lowest terms

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
will write our answer in lowest terms
whenever<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.119> multiplying<00:01:48.720> mixed

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
whenever we are multiplying mixed

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.039 
whenever we are multiplying mixed
numbers<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.649> need<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.280> change<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.180> mixed

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
numbers we need to change the mixed

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
numbers we need to change the mixed
numbers<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.560> improper<00:01:52.820> fractions<00:01:53.820> before<00:01:54.030> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
numbers to improper fractions before we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.959 
numbers to improper fractions before we
multiply<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.640> 3<00:01:57.409> times<00:01:58.409> 1<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.219> 1/2<00:01:59.640> as

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
multiply so we have 3 times 1 in 1/2 as

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.550 
multiply so we have 3 times 1 in 1/2 as
an<00:02:00.119> improper<00:02:00.630> fraction<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.290> three-halves<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
an improper fraction is three-halves and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.999 
an improper fraction is three-halves and
2<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.920> 2/3<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.149> an<00:02:06.329> improper<00:02:06.810> fraction<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:08.720> 8/3

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
2 and 2/3 as an improper fraction is 8/3

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.640 
2 and 2/3 as an improper fraction is 8/3
3<00:02:11.009> has<00:02:11.250> an<00:02:11.430> understood<00:02:11.879> denominator<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.750> 1

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
3 has an understood denominator of 1

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.750 
3 has an understood denominator of 1
so<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.310> multiply<00:02:15.440> numerators<00:02:16.440> 3<00:02:16.739> times<00:02:17.549> 3

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so we multiply numerators 3 times 3

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
so we multiply numerators 3 times 3
times<00:02:17.790> 8<00:02:18.209> over<00:02:18.360> 1<00:02:18.720> times<00:02:18.930> 2<00:02:19.290> times<00:02:19.530> 3<00:02:19.739> but<00:02:20.610> we

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
times 8 over 1 times 2 times 3 but we

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.759 
times 8 over 1 times 2 times 3 but we
first<00:02:21.060> need<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.360> look<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:22.049> if<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.349> can<00:02:22.560> do

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
first need to look and see if we can do

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.180 
first need to look and see if we can do
some<00:02:23.150> cancellation<00:02:24.150> before<00:02:24.569> we<00:02:24.720> multiply<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
some cancellation before we multiply and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.940 
some cancellation before we multiply and
you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.879> here<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.019> 3<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.739> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you can see here that we have a 3 in the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.720 
you can see here that we have a 3 in the
numerator<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:31.170> 3<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> denominator<00:02:31.730> 3

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
numerator and a 3 in the denominator 3

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.149 
numerator and a 3 in the denominator 3
divides<00:02:33.030> into<00:02:33.180> 3<00:02:33.480> 1<00:02:33.720> time<00:02:34.019> 3<00:02:34.049> divides<00:02:34.709> into<00:02:34.860> 3

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
divides into 3 1 time 3 divides into 3

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.479 
divides into 3 1 time 3 divides into 3
once<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> 2<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.709> denominator<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
once we have a 2 in the denominator and

to divide fractions we invert the second

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.929 
to divide fractions we invert the second
fraction<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.710> multiply<00:04:52.689> so<00:04:53.689> we<00:04:54.199> have<00:04:54.590> 15<00:04:55.340> over

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:00.129 
fraction and multiply so we have 15 over
8<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.870> we're<00:04:57.529> going<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.710> multiply<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.550> by<00:04:59.139> 4

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
8 and we're going to multiply that by 4

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.510 
8 and we're going to multiply that by 4
over<00:05:01.090> 25<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.599> of<00:05:03.529> course<00:05:03.860> we<00:05:04.069> are<00:05:04.189> going<00:05:04.219> to

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
over 25 and of course we are going to

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.890 
over 25 and of course we are going to
divide<00:05:04.819> out<00:05:05.060> common<00:05:05.360> factors<00:05:05.650> if<00:05:06.879> possible

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
divide out common factors if possible

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.920 
divide out common factors if possible
before<00:05:08.900> we<00:05:09.409> actually<00:05:09.710> perform<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:11.150> operation

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
before we actually perform the operation

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.040 
before we actually perform the operation
so<00:05:12.740> 15<00:05:13.610> over<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> times<00:05:15.110> 4<00:05:15.589> over<00:05:15.860> 25<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.900> will

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
so 15 over a times 4 over 25 you will

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.800 
so 15 over a times 4 over 25 you will
see<00:05:18.289> that<00:05:18.500> 4<00:05:19.069> divides<00:05:19.279> into<00:05:19.550> 4<00:05:19.879> one<00:05:20.150> time<00:05:20.180> for

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
see that 4 divides into 4 one time for

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.499 
see that 4 divides into 4 one time for

devising the a 2 and you will see that

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.829 
devising the a 2 and you will see that
15<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.020> 25<00:05:24.620> have<00:05:24.979> a<00:05:25.009> common<00:05:25.490> factor<00:05:25.879> of<00:05:25.909> 5<00:05:26.300> 5
