this challenger battle that I had as I

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.580 
this challenger battle that I had as I
felt<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.970> showed<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> tankiness<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
felt like it showed the tankiness of the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
felt like it showed the tankiness of the
bot<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:32.040> well<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.969> able<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> take

bot very well it was able to take

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
bot very well it was able to take
extremely<00:00:34.200> large<00:00:34.410> amounts<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.950> fire<00:00:35.190> while

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
extremely large amounts of fire while

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
extremely large amounts of fire while
receiving<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.329> few<00:00:36.540> heels<00:00:36.899> while<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.860> being

you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.490> here<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.000> even<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.660> lost

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you can see here that even if you lost

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
you can see here that even if you lost
two<00:00:55.200> rotors<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.950> hover<00:00:56.160> blades<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.640> enough

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
two rotors the hover blades are enough

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.760 
two rotors the hover blades are enough
strength<00:00:57.240> to<00:00:57.450> help<00:00:57.600> lift<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.110> up<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.560> the

building it keep them pink just like I

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.750 
building it keep them pink just like I
had<00:03:46.270> them<00:03:46.450> these<00:03:47.050> are<00:03:47.260> blue<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:48.280> bottom<00:03:48.610> ones

had them these are blue the bottom ones

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:10.710 
had them these are blue the bottom ones
stay<00:03:48.970> pink

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.920 

we're<00:05:27.950> going<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.130> use<00:05:28.310> t6<00:05:29.090> electro<00:05:29.480> plates<00:05:29.750> to

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
we're going to use t6 electro plates to
