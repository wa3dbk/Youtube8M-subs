bowl when you hit it on the edge of the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.940 
bowl when you hit it on the edge of the
bowl<00:03:02.800> you're<00:03:02.980> more<00:03:03.190> likely<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.640> shatter<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
bowl you're more likely to shatter the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.500 
bowl you're more likely to shatter the
shell<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.280> get<00:03:06.490> pieces<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:07.030> shell<00:03:07.210> in<00:03:07.270> your

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
shell and get pieces of shell in your

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.690 
shell and get pieces of shell in your
batter<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.050> if<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:08.950> hit<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> flat

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
batter and if you hit it on a flat

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.500 
batter and if you hit it on a flat
surface<00:03:09.970> you're<00:03:10.420> forming<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.970> thumb<00:03:12.970> hole<00:03:13.180> for

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
surface you're forming a thumb hole for

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.990 
surface you're forming a thumb hole for
both<00:03:13.660> your<00:03:13.900> thumbs<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:15.550> break<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
both your thumbs so you can break the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.790 
both your thumbs so you can break the
membrane<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.750> get<00:03:16.930> into<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.350> egg<00:03:17.530> without

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
membrane and get into the egg without

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.850 
membrane and get into the egg without
breaking<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.670> shell<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.750> shattering<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.710> and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
breaking the shell and shattering it and

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:31.980 
breaking the shell and shattering it and
getting<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.490> batter<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:31.360> as<00:03:31.570> simple<00:03:31.720> as

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
getting it in the batter so as simple as

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.630 
getting it in the batter so as simple as
that<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.440> we're<00:03:32.560> there<00:03:32.830> now<00:03:33.100> I'm<00:03:33.190> gonna<00:03:33.340> check

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
that and we're there now I'm gonna check

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.100 
that and we're there now I'm gonna check
my<00:03:33.880> crust<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.950> we'll<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.070> ready<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.370> fill<00:03:37.110> with

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
my crust and we'll be ready to fill with

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.720 
my crust and we'll be ready to fill with
the<00:03:38.170> graham<00:03:38.410> cracker<00:03:38.710> crust<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.550> it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the graham cracker crust like this it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.180 
the graham cracker crust like this it
has<00:03:39.910> risen<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.480> little<00:03:40.720> bit<00:03:40.930> from<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.290> heat<00:03:41.500> and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
has risen a little bit from the heat and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.170 
has risen a little bit from the heat and
so<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.610> just<00:03:43.030> want<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:44.490> press<00:03:45.490> it<00:03:45.520> down<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.910> little

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
so I just want to press it down a little

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.880 
so I just want to press it down a little
more<00:03:46.330> firmly<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.050> give<00:03:47.230> us<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.500> really<00:03:47.740> good

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
more firmly to give us a really good

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:58.920 
more firmly to give us a really good
base<00:03:48.490> I<00:03:50.130> just<00:03:51.130> filled<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.520> pan<00:03:57.570> okay<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.810> now

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
base I just filled a pan okay and now

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.280 
base I just filled a pan okay and now
for<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.230> blueberry<00:03:59.650> part<00:04:00.450> what<00:04:01.450> I'm<00:04:01.600> using<00:04:01.840> is

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
for the blueberry part what I'm using is

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.330 
for the blueberry part what I'm using is
my<00:04:02.590> wild<00:04:03.130> blueberry<00:04:03.700> lemon<00:04:04.180> jam<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:05.340> it's

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
my wild blueberry lemon jam and it's

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.370 
my wild blueberry lemon jam and it's
half<00:04:06.640> wild<00:04:07.209> blueberries<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.170> half

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
half wild blueberries and half

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.330 
half wild blueberries and half
cultivated<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:11.290> thing<00:04:11.500> with<00:04:11.650> blueberries<00:04:12.160> is

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
cultivated the thing with blueberries is

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.270 
cultivated the thing with blueberries is
a<00:04:12.370> wonderful<00:04:13.090> flavor<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:14.050> when<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.590> make<00:04:14.800> jam

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
a wonderful flavor but when you make jam

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.210 
a wonderful flavor but when you make jam
out<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.520> them<00:04:16.049> adding<00:04:17.049> sugar<00:04:17.290> really<00:04:17.830> kills

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
out of them adding sugar really kills

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.810 
out of them adding sugar really kills
the<00:04:18.370> flavor<00:04:18.730> so<00:04:19.480> what<00:04:19.720> I've<00:04:19.870> done<00:04:20.169> is<00:04:20.820> break

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
the flavor so what I've done is break

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.690 
the flavor so what I've done is break
down<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.300> flavor<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.370> intensify<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.430> by

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
down the flavor and intensify it by

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.180 
down the flavor and intensify it by
using<00:04:25.560> flavors<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:27.270> mimic<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.190> blueberry

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
using flavors that mimic the blueberry

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.860 
using flavors that mimic the blueberry
flavor<00:04:30.490> when<00:04:30.760> they're<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.000> put<00:04:31.240> together<00:04:31.360> and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
flavor when they're all put together and

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.909 
flavor when they're all put together and
right<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:32.830> I've<00:04:32.980> used<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:34.650> little<00:04:35.650> bit<00:04:35.830> of

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
right so I've used a little bit of

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.790 
right so I've used a little bit of
pineapple<00:04:36.460> juice<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:37.350> little<00:04:38.350> bit<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.590> Meyer

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
