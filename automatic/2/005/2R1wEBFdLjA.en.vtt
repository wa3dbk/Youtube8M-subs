00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.030 

we<00:00:00.599> show<00:00:00.780> how<00:00:00.810> we<00:00:01.020> like<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.290> outs<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.829> sit

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
we show how we like the outs to sit

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.830 
we show how we like the outs to sit
outside<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.760> we're<00:00:03.240> not<00:00:03.300> talking<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.659> how

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
outside and we're not talking about how

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.059 
outside and we're not talking about how
we<00:00:03.899> want<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.140> move<00:00:04.319> yet<00:00:04.470> we'll<00:00:04.650> get<00:00:04.770> into<00:00:04.950> that

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
we want to move yet we'll get into that

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.619 
we want to move yet we'll get into that
a<00:00:05.130> little<00:00:05.310> bit<00:00:05.460> but<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:06.299> gonna<00:00:06.390> demonstrate

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
a little bit but we're gonna demonstrate

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.720 
a little bit but we're gonna demonstrate
how<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.930> want<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> back<00:00:07.440> set<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> lot<00:00:08.700> of

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
how we want to do a back set so a lot of

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
how we want to do a back set so a lot of
this<00:00:08.910> stuff<00:00:09.120> actually<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:09.990> take<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> ball

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this stuff actually how we take the ball

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.959 
this stuff actually how we take the ball
and<00:00:10.590> everything<00:00:10.950> sets<00:00:11.370> us<00:00:11.490> up<00:00:11.580> really<00:00:11.849> well

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
and everything sets us up really well

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.890 
and everything sets us up really well
for<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> back<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.509> that's<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
for the back so that's one of the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.450 
for the back so that's one of the
reasons<00:00:13.110> why<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> take<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> ball<00:00:14.280> high

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
reasons why I like to take the ball high

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
reasons why I like to take the ball high
and<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.299> almost<00:00:15.509> want<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.960> leaning<00:00:16.170> back<00:00:16.320> as

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and we almost want to be leaning back as

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.620 
and we almost want to be leaning back as
we<00:00:16.740> set<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.039> ball<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:18.119> uh<00:00:18.210> let's<00:00:18.510> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
we set this ball so let's uh let's just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.880 
we set this ball so let's uh let's just
demonstrate<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.140> couple<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.500> sets<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.800> we'll

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
demonstrate a couple back sets and we'll

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:33.189 
demonstrate a couple back sets and we'll
talk<00:00:20.070> about<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.430> okay<00:00:25.250> it's<00:00:26.250> good

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.079 

so<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:33.859> you'll<00:00:34.489> see<00:00:34.789> that<00:00:36.460> when<00:00:37.460> we<00:00:37.579> set<00:00:37.850> this

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
so you you'll see that when we set this

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.660 
so you you'll see that when we set this
we<00:00:39.019> want<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.289> get<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.679> separation<00:00:40.159> again<00:00:40.519> we

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
we want to get a separation again we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.040 
we want to get a separation again we
still<00:00:40.820> wanna<00:00:40.940> get<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.149> same<00:00:41.359> separation<00:00:41.809> from

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
still wanna get the same separation from

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.079 
still wanna get the same separation from
hip<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.409> short<00:00:42.589> no<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.949> changes<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.969> in

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
hip and short no that changes and in

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.279 
hip and short no that changes and in
fact<00:00:44.329> where<00:00:44.539> we<00:00:44.600> take<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.870> ball<00:00:45.019> it<00:00:45.170> doesn't

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
fact where we take the ball it doesn't

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.560 
fact where we take the ball it doesn't
change<00:00:45.649> what<00:00:46.339> we<00:00:46.460> want<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.760> change<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:47.539> just

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
change what we want to change is just

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.259 
change what we want to change is just
where<00:00:48.229> we<00:00:48.320> finish<00:00:48.589> our<00:00:48.739> hands<00:00:49.100> so<00:00:49.670> everything

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
where we finish our hands so everything

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.490 
where we finish our hands so everything
that<00:00:50.299> we<00:00:50.420> do<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:50.629> want<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.869> keep<00:00:50.960> as<00:00:51.110> simple<00:00:51.440> as

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
that we do we want to keep as simple as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.289 
that we do we want to keep as simple as
possible<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.309> whole<00:00:52.460> technique<00:00:52.909> as<00:00:53.089> far<00:00:53.119> as

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
possible the whole technique as far as

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.029 
possible the whole technique as far as
how<00:00:53.479> we<00:00:53.510> move<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:53.989> ball<00:00:54.109> we<00:00:54.379> do<00:00:54.500> think<00:00:54.710> it's

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
how we move to the ball we do think it's

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.700 
how we move to the ball we do think it's
gonna<00:00:55.190> be<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.399> same<00:00:55.609> not<00:00:56.359> just<00:00:56.659> because<00:00:56.989> it

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
gonna be the same not just because it

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.560 
gonna be the same not just because it
makes<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.189> more<00:00:58.339> just<00:00:58.549> acceptable<00:00:59.299> although

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
makes it more just acceptable although

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.020 
makes it more just acceptable although
that's<00:01:00.469> not<00:01:00.739> our<00:01:00.920> main<00:01:01.100> goal<00:01:01.519> our<00:01:01.670> main<00:01:01.820> goal

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
that's not our main goal our main goal

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.810 
that's not our main goal our main goal
is<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.239> set<00:01:02.420> good<00:01:02.629> balls<00:01:02.890> but<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.159> also<00:01:04.309> because

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
is to set good balls but it also because

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.550 
is to set good balls but it also because
it<00:01:05.330> makes<00:01:05.539> it<00:01:05.659> more<00:01:05.780> repeatable<00:01:06.259> we<00:01:06.380> want<00:01:06.500> to

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
it makes it more repeatable we want to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.630 
it makes it more repeatable we want to
be<00:01:06.619> able<00:01:06.679> to<00:01:06.800> repeat<00:01:07.069> this<00:01:07.220> set<00:01:07.429> especially

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
be able to repeat this set especially

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.639 
be able to repeat this set especially
this<00:01:08.090> setting<00:01:08.360> position<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.899> so<00:01:09.319> we<00:01:09.470> want

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
this setting position and so we want

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.710 
this setting position and so we want
this<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.920> be<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.069> same<00:01:10.369> where<00:01:11.030> we're<00:01:11.179> taking

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
this to be the same where we're taking

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.649 
this to be the same where we're taking
the<00:01:11.929> ball<00:01:12.080> high<00:01:12.229> as<00:01:12.530> we<00:01:12.860> would<00:01:12.979> undergo<00:01:13.659> with

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
the ball high as we would undergo with

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.389 
the ball high as we would undergo with
the<00:01:14.780> torquing<00:01:15.110> motion<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.649> had<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.039> then

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
the torquing motion like we had and then

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.889 
the torquing motion like we had and then
all<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.030> only<00:01:17.210> thing<00:01:17.299> that<00:01:17.390> changes<00:01:17.690> is<00:01:17.750> that

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
all the only thing that changes is that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.120 
all the only thing that changes is that
we<00:01:18.080> finish<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.770> target<00:01:19.009> with<00:01:19.100> our

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
we finish to the target with our

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.340 
we finish to the target with our
problems<00:01:19.459> outside<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:20.479> finish<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.929> target

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
problems outside we finish the target

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.880 
problems outside we finish the target
with<00:01:21.440> our<00:01:21.530> palms

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
with our palms

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.279 
with our palms
going<00:01:22.369> backwards<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.330> see<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.899> lot<00:01:24.080> of<00:01:24.110> this

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
going backwards so I see a lot of this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.020 
going backwards so I see a lot of this
and<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:24.530> sit<00:01:24.740> back<00:01:24.979> we<00:01:25.429> want<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.700> see<00:01:25.880> them

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
and we sit back we want to see them

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.999 
and we sit back we want to see them
finish<00:01:26.390> with<00:01:26.929> their<00:01:27.080> palms<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.649> target

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
finish with their palms to the target

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.309 
finish with their palms to the target
when<00:01:28.250> they<00:01:28.340> set<00:01:28.549> back<00:01:31.330> really<00:01:32.330> good<00:01:32.450> good

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
when they set back really good good

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.070 
when they set back really good good
exaggeration<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.490> have<00:01:35.330> her<00:01:35.479> set<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:35.899> back

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
exaggeration so have her set that back

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.679 
exaggeration so have her set that back
good<00:01:36.640> we<00:01:37.640> wanna<00:01:37.820> make<00:01:37.880> sure<00:01:37.939> both<00:01:38.240> hands<00:01:38.509> are

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
good we wanna make sure both hands are

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.800 
good we wanna make sure both hands are
finishing<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> you'll<00:01:41.180> see<00:01:41.359> they're<00:01:41.600> still

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
finishing so you'll see they're still

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.289 
finishing so you'll see they're still
torquing<00:01:42.320> motion<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:44.090> want<00:01:44.270> to

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
torquing motion and then we want to

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.749 
torquing motion and then we want to
finish<00:01:44.509> with<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.380> finish<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.340> spot<00:01:46.640> where

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
finish with the finish to the spot where

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.590 
finish with the finish to the spot where
we<00:01:46.820> want<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.119> ball<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.299> go<00:01:49.299> good<00:01:50.299> one<00:01:50.509> more

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
we want the ball to go good one more

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.849 
we want the ball to go good one more
time<00:01:52.659> okay<00:01:53.659> let's<00:01:53.929> get<00:01:54.020> Andrea<00:01:54.350> up<00:01:54.439> here<00:01:54.710> and

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
time okay let's get Andrea up here and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.490 
time okay let's get Andrea up here and
we'll<00:01:55.280> see<00:01:55.429> how<00:01:55.549> she<00:01:55.579> does<00:01:55.759> on<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.500> we've

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
we'll see how she does on this we've

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.109 
we'll see how she does on this we've
progressed<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.340> far<00:01:58.579> with<00:01:58.700> her<00:01:58.850> where<00:01:59.000> she

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
progressed so far with her where she

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.279 
progressed so far with her where she
understands<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.659> torque<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:00.140> she

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
understands the torque again she

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.050 
understands the torque again she
understands<00:02:00.649> how<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.770> catch<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.219> throw<00:02:01.280> so

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
understands how to catch and throw so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.639 
understands how to catch and throw so

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.770 
that she has a great torquing motion and
then<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.609> she<00:03:27.819> because<00:03:28.419> you<00:03:28.510> keep<00:03:28.659> her

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
then that she because you keep her

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.030 
then that she because you keep her
shoulder<00:03:29.109> back<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.290> then<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.769> energy

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
shoulder back and then as the energy

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.379 
shoulder back and then as the energy
comes<00:03:30.250> up<00:03:30.430> does<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.760> feel<00:03:30.879> pretty<00:03:31.120> strong

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
comes up does that feel pretty strong

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.240 
comes up does that feel pretty strong
when<00:03:31.599> you<00:03:31.659> throw<00:03:31.810> back<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.530> energy<00:03:32.829> comes<00:03:33.040> up

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
when you throw back the energy comes up

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.920 
when you throw back the energy comes up
she<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.879> fire<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.120> ball<00:03:34.450> back<00:03:34.659> and<00:03:34.810> all

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
she can fire that ball back and all

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.689 
she can fire that ball back and all
she's<00:03:35.169> doing<00:03:35.349> is<00:03:35.470> redirecting<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.220> ball<00:03:36.370> so

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
she's doing is redirecting the ball so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.500 
she's doing is redirecting the ball so
one<00:03:37.000> more<00:03:37.120> time

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
one more time

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.569 
one more time
let's<00:03:37.870> watch<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:39.419> good<00:03:40.889> again<00:03:41.889> yeah<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:42.459> can

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
let's watch this good again yeah we can

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.819 
let's watch this good again yeah we can
keep<00:03:42.669> that<00:03:42.819> one<00:03:42.970> let's<00:03:43.720> try<00:03:43.930> now<00:03:44.109> instead<00:03:44.769> of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
keep that one let's try now instead of

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.680 
keep that one let's try now instead of
that<00:03:44.979> flat<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:45.579> a<00:03:45.760> little<00:03:46.060> bit<00:03:46.150> higher<00:03:46.329> okay

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that flat just a little bit higher okay

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.099 
that flat just a little bit higher okay
so<00:03:47.139> when<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:47.349> talk<00:03:47.530> about<00:03:48.810> setting<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.959> don't

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
so when we talk about setting you don't

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.300 
so when we talk about setting you don't
set<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.349> way<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.829> don't<00:03:50.889> change<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.190> way

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
set the way if you don't change the way

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.319 
set the way if you don't change the way
you<00:03:51.370> finish<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:51.819> change<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
you finish you just change the

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.909 
you finish you just change the
trajectory<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.290> set<00:03:53.470> out<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:53.709> right<00:03:53.799> now

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
trajectory that you set out so right now

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.770 
trajectory that you set out so right now
your<00:03:54.069> this<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.370> your<00:03:54.459> trajectory<00:03:54.669> this<00:03:55.599> one

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
your this is your trajectory this one

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.539 
your this is your trajectory this one
make<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.139> turn<00:03:56.379> like<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> 45<00:03:57.310> degree<00:03:57.400> angle

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
make it this turn like a 45 degree angle

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.920 
make it this turn like a 45 degree angle
instead<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.209> parallel<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.260> floor

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
instead of a parallel to the floor

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.860 
instead of a parallel to the floor
good<00:04:01.959> no<00:04:02.590> that's<00:04:03.159> now<00:04:03.370> let's<00:04:03.639> focus<00:04:03.819> on<00:04:04.060> finish

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
good no that's now let's focus on finish

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.659 
good no that's now let's focus on finish
with<00:04:05.019> both<00:04:05.199> your<00:04:05.379> palms<00:04:05.560> at<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.919> spot<00:04:08.669> okay

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
with both your palms at that spot okay

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.270 
with both your palms at that spot okay
that's<00:04:10.299> really<00:04:10.540> good<00:04:10.829> again<00:04:11.829> get<00:04:12.250> that

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that's really good again get that

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.680 
that's really good again get that
torquing<00:04:12.790> motion<00:04:14.099> good<00:04:15.099> now<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.120> want<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.539> to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
torquing motion good now I want you to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.449 
torquing motion good now I want you to
try<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.470> when<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.919> do<00:04:18.039> this<00:04:18.130> you're<00:04:18.310> kind<00:04:18.430> of

to<00:04:32.110> teach<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.460> want<00:04:33.639> to<00:04:33.699> go<00:04:33.789> faster<00:04:34.240> and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
to teach it but we want to go faster and

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.310 
to teach it but we want to go faster and
we<00:04:34.389> want<00:04:34.509> to<00:04:34.570> pick<00:04:34.659> up<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.840> tempo<00:04:35.020> want<00:04:35.259> to

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
we want to pick up the tempo want to
