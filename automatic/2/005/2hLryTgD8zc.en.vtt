00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 an important feature of the browser for those who work with 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.139
 deliveries that have to go through many months is to make a quota containing all 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.679
 the months 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.819
 so it's very difficult for example 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:17.400
 I have to pass on three powers 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.520
 I put the first address and added as destination 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.240
 the gps already closed the route to wear from there I look for another meireles for example 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.130
 on here 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.859
 and just add step 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.759
 I'll keep on 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.969
 gps already makes the traditional route of the new address on the street 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.450
 already has more grip due to the operation 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.480
 the yellow flag is the crossing point and the end point is the flag 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.600
 checkered 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.929
 if I want to spend 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.579
 it deserves to follow a course different from that created by gps for example 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170
 if I have more urgency to go through this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.590
 I enter penultimate 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.730
 it's broken 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.010
 and I'll show everyone 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.480
 the addresses 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.300
 Where I am is the first 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910
 which is the starting point 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 the last is the destination 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.860
 to guide waypoints 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.860
 hill steps and move up or down 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.830
 moving upwards became a crossing point to be reached earlier 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.799
 down becomes a point to be reached later 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.880
 if you move in the harsh state to the last position 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.390
 this will become the 'end point' 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 but if you want to pass on all points in the best possible way 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.720
 I was with the timisoara 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.770
 I do not think the starting point and last point I want to take from the world 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.530
 for doubt 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.539
 the last is enough government up as fair 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.770
 the point that you want to be the last one 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.320
 to the last position 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.790
 and click reuse 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 that's all it takes to get a life back on track 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.579
 W 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.579
 d 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 the browser 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.670
 and an agreement with any of the bbc 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.030
 he looks for one more of them anybody else to comment 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.729
 add one more complicator then go 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.079
 other publisher 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.699
 in a few months up and down and what forms peaceful 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.610
 then return to the end point
