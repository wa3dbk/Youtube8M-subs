00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.229
 very good totals as you are 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 first new to the channel today I bring you a 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:09.120
 video that I had really forgotten 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
 completely done when all this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.210
 boom of the multiplayer revelation 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.480
 of call of duty ghosts all this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 advantages information gouts guns yo 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 the truth I started uploading videos for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.060
 that this one would be aware 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 sorry you were informed as they are 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.360
 a subject that I had thought to touch and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.130
 fact very little has been said in the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.470
 Spanish community of this and many people 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
 is confused and I forgot 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.430
 complete and yesterday watching a video of a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.170
 friend I do not know if he said a keyword 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 a key phrase that made me remember 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.059
 this video that was missing by uploading 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 channel and really it was imperative the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 theme of the videos as you are well in the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.030
 title the types of nuclear or so 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.649
 unless we know until the moment of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.969
 with the many games you will already know this 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.829
 theme but I recommend staying until the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 end of the video because there is to publish 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.770
 one thing on twitter with your ticket 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.030
 I have to analyze and it's going to be very 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.800
 important because today 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 sure you are going to have another video 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.030
 analyzing what I'm going to comment 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.000
 later after we will see 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.379
 it turns out that there is a nuclear that good 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.430
 Almost everyone knows it 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.710
 call the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 geim these gusts are achieved from a 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.370
 specific game mode which 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 great flame that you already know we send a 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.000
 enemy we have 30 seconds in the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 which are we going at a speed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 punctured with heroin and I know we're going 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.840
 covered we have 30 seconds to kill 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.640
 an enemy and if we do not kill him we explode 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.680
 if we kill it, the counter is reset 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 ok we already know krankl it turns out 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.430
 that in this specific game mode and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.869
 in this specific specific map 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.610
 sorry in which you are seeing the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.410
 gameplay we can complete a series of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.910
 challenges which are obtained from the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.250
 next way we have to get a 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.470
 blue briefcase that is obtained when killing to the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 first of the opposing team when 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.430
 we take that briefcase for example we 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 will kill an enemy in the back 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.470
 if we do skip another challenge and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 we are chaining challenges until the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.660
 end they magically give us a package of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 help and we throw it and the inside falls 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.780
 to the nuclear streak that is the one 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.430
 you are looking down on the left that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 it's like a symbol of the death of a 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.300
 skull with tweezers what she does is 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.390
 basically destroy the map by 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.160
 complete remodel it like that in a way 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 totally different and kills the team 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.340
 otherwise it 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.569
 that we leave it on the one hand a nuclear 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.370
 that is achieved in a game mode 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.739
 specific with specific challenges 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.870
 as a specific map and even the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.459
 nuclear that on that part for that part 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.920
 many people were disappointed because 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.630
 said oyster and the mortal and it will not be 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.060
 the moab alone that way the game and that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.069
 map what the fuck is this quiet 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 kids because if I had not wet 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.660
 because in the trailer they were going to show us 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 another nuclear totally with an icon 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.019
 totally different from the common streak 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.390
 that what is the fashion that all 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.880
 we know this is the fashion that everyone 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 we know that it is obviously going to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.450
 come back here you are watching the trailer 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.709
 as it is the same map on which it is taken 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 the nuclear one but that does not mean 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.850
 that the absolute master can be obtained in 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.620
 this map just happened 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.230
 that only these maps were available 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.880
 and also this is another game mode 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.400
 which I think is hard for teams 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.500
 the markers below good we go to a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.580
 subject that a lot of people got confused saw 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.320
 what 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.450
 many people in the trailer saw that I 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.400
 he threw a help package he took the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 help package activated the switch 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 and suddenly jumped into the water and exploded 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 this is wrong the app is enemy because 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.540
 because when you take the package it turns out 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.700
 that inside the package and gives you another 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.070
 streak which is pulling with the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.930
 switch but if you look you mean the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.700
 switch is the actuator that's 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.890
 streaks to call it that but can not 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.930
 be that he himself is pulling the moa 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.750
 who has thrown the package because when 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.300
 It gives the actuator runs the moa and 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.980
 in the counter is zero makes the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.900
 seconds is how we all know that the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.250
 love has a 10- second counter or 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 I do not remember when I do not agree 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.150
 perfectly how much is but good 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.490
 they have a delay a few seconds to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.220
 explode therefore death was 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.720
 enemy and then it has nothing to do 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.280
 with the player who was not showing 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.110
 here in the good trailer 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.580
 It's pretty clear, I think for a 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.790
 side we have the account the way 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.040
 specific to the specific map and by 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.080
 another place we have called her alone 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.580
 nuclear we know so far 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.990
 fashion, I think it's going to be 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.090
 all maps and in all modes of 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.580
 game is a method similar to modern 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.280
 warfare 3 let's move on now to one thing 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.680
 very interesting that showed yesterday in the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.880
 twitter of call of duty first 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.800
 they published this photo so so curious the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.620
 which then good we see here as a 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.560
 it looks like a cover a poster of a 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.380
 orbital science magazine 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.580
 defense initiates initiative iniciativ 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.580
 specific as 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.909
 such a defense orbital in a 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:43.129
 initiative as a defensive weapon 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.289
 which is called audi and they first published 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.119
 that photo and they said is this real and 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.649
 then they posted a road trailer and 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:51.229
 the truth left me speechless and with 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:52.939
 much eager to see what 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.949
 they were going to show today because you see that today 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.199
 in the afternoon we are very attentive to the 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.999
 channel because they sure go up something go up 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.519
 something to the channel with his uncle advance 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:04.459
 something clear showed of this video in the 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:06.919
 putting a satellite which today is already 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.259
 as a kind of giant rocket I do not know 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.999
 in a ray that good hits against the 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.039
 ground and there the tractor trailer is cut 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.569
 suddenly this obviously first thing 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.569
 what you can think is host 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.919
 it can be a new streak something like that and not 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.379
 the truth that excites me quite 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.479
 because we already talked about the one that 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.309
 of the bet can be let's say another 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.019
 kind of nuclear to our best we read and 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.179
 It is a streak of help is achieved 

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:32.029
 killing five people and destroying the 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.259
 world stealth bomber time and yes 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.909
 you remember you played us the 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.139
 model apart is so I'm not very 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.639
 intrigued kids we are very attentive 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.099
 to the channel this afternoon because surely 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.180
 they get some of this and they also said that 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.270
 and mana 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.620
 to present this tomorrow is to say today like this 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.570
 that nothing more people this has been my video 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.910
 about the types of nuclear that 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.100
 we know so far sure in 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.139
 call of duty cost if you have any questions 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.729
 do not hesitate to leave it in the comments 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.350
 and nothing more if you liked the video 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.210
 well remember I would appreciate a lot 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.060
 that I will support it is like a like that we 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.160
 it costs nothing and nothing else we see this 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.880
 late maybe and if not then until tomorrow 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.880
 goodbye
