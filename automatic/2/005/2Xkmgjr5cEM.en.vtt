00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 so sir alphonse congo since a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.730
 some time we do not hear about 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.189
 the opposition what is not jumping 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.860
 that's what you dropped the arts 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.509
 is it over the fight 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.130
 no you all you know we chose 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.270
 do not deliver from this next land 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 month you have a revived policy of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 things every time one thing a moment 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.269
 given you have to charge you think that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 everything we did during the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.710
 elections everything was eating like 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 financial material means in these 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 elections there that we know we 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 was this board includes greens to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 scratch not at all but we have 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 chose to defend ourselves for paris 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 where some reason and I know you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.129
 say you guarantee that there are things that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
 things were going on 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.570
 we pushed this thing past 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.480
 this Colombian strategy because you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 wait for the tentative moment to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 unveil this same cave to the forces 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 from the order of not speaking was I 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.160
 do not want this thing because 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 we barely told a lot of people 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.650
 have passed you know the street we have 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.299
 practiced for four years okay on 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.320
 do not say we do not say it's 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.500
 not a good seymour strategy 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.659
 strategy sets in motion I 'm doing this to you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.920
 let the soldiers go to participate and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920
 there is no where I had done 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.799
 I leave time to time and you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.509
 will see then for some time 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.799
 behind question since a certain 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.180
 time we no longer see the head of state 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.040
 is enough rumors that made that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.079
 like he's sick and everything then 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.610
 why as a member of the assembly 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.460
 national especially of the opposition 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.520
 you do not want to know this silence 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 the chief of state normally one 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.159
 should the presidency should 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.840
 communicate about the health of the head of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.380
 the state is the most absolute right of the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.620
 Togolese people 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.540
 so why 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.390
 deputies you will not be to to to 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.930
 clarify this point there to know some 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.580
 thing on it 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.410
 you dear you tell yourself that for 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.750
 people intelligence when you buy 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.370
 with once twice the third 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.220
 party know a lot about it 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.720
 you got nothing we were in this country when 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.510
 this time he himself had circulated between 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.500
 time seems to be the illness of the head of 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.950
 the very state of his death all this in 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.460
 and another day and the airport 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.690
 pictures and you're not telling me that 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.760
 seriously know he still has some 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 years later and I'm still launching 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.460
 completed but I have five men text I 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.440
 prepares the strategy that the power 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.150
 use and I will not thank you again 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 dassin trend is clear we have 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.960
 waited for control and I do not care 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.000
 mexican as a sick he can not 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.500
 clearly says it's his problem 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.330
 especially me I do not want the morning 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.730
 avoid the charge is all that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.180
 because that's it when the rumors have 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.370
 start 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.850
 you saw a few weeks after 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.920
 weeks later we saw appear on 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.730
 television screens have some 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.830
 care of the exchanges and so I do not 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 not want or someone who knows is this 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.190
 what to do there and someone who knows to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.330
 what game is playing me I do not want to 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.739
 berna break their heads for dick or 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.239
 suggestions see if the cops 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.400
 selectively sick is not sick 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.510
 that's not a problem if twilight 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.630
 everyone is regularly on this 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 problem us when people sick and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.820
 after the elections there are many are 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.680
 become ill 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.420
 no no i'm talking about isabelle 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.430
 with the city had gotten sick 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.860
 turn to everyone his mother you see 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.720
 all of us practically both 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.140
 sick are humans we have nerves 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.200
 mortals but want to attack at 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.790
 find the cause of messages 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.680
 I have nothing to say then a 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.450
 fargo equalization 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.030
 we had learned that lindsay was 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.049
 beat hot to prove his 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.879
 victory of the elections of Africa 2015 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.180
 do not you think that this 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:48.000
 be a delay you know it's not 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.819
 now that one is great for his 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.579
 victory in the hand in the meuse at 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.189
 about April 28th but what is 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.900
 we said jean says confronted his 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.849
 dallas service and a few days more 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.280
 later he came out also we results 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.969
 and we explained why on 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.560
 series lands 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.909
 it was during this news before country 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.810
 but it's in the few flaws 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.609
 we have demonstrated that if 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.340
 do you want the continent but I can 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.560
 to make sure we have not stayed there 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.530
 was my friend my which is written on board 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.840
 deformed and waiting for the return of the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.490
 opposition leader who has so much 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.789
 travel to make a copy of the pieces 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.780
 and thought it all but we 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.970
 let's debate only this way 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.160
 to denounce says that the environment a 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.440
 punk in hell of humor causing the cub 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.729
 and not by that you also need them 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 assaults but what have understood 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.310
 that's how I understood it is that 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.139
 we have to rely on no one 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.729
 we must rely on no white us 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.930
 must profession no European 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.330
 we have to protect the corner 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.250
 the ambassador for me even the Togolese 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.960
 time the bull by the horns 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.490
 I see at the cernil we have a problem 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.849
 it is we who have the platinum 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.110
 means and therefore has none and the 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.849
 see put my land right to tell me 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.530
 that these this we are a movement 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.830
 as recalled for the opinion 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.539
 national in mental view that you we 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.840
 finance now we know the cnom 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.889
 international seized its chance exists 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.630
 to do a thing like that remains a 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.030
 problem since from the start we 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.360
 have been the codi you know for 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.250
 they come to shop 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.020
 the fault committed to man we found 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.520
 in the end of not receiving and amble why 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.169
 these people still need it so 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.139
 doubly it's Togolese term or the 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.389
 tour that all good geek and I you 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.610
 ensures that at nice and not 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.270
 give up for lack of fighters the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.979
 continuous fight 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.080
 kind of fighters now we 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.930
 think we adopt all that's short 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.340
 you suppose to vote that's all 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.270
 so thank you very much our 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.389
 brains and it's up to me 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.389
 thank
