00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.650
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.080
 to the video burtons different 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.250
 training systems 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.800
 I explain the differences here 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.199
 between the est disc and reflex 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.050
 First , the stock exchange 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.279
 black disc variant display now gives 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.710
 it's been a very long time they are so to speak 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.450
 the classic under the binding at the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.640
 Dis binding is the entire base plate 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.230
 one-piece the disadvantage is that this 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.329
 base plate little feeling for is brad 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.489
 permits because it is less flexible the 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.680
 beneficial but also taken the match 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 Pretty much every binding montage is very 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.210
 sturdy and land 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.829
 the stb now have at the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.329
 base plate if you still have it 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.760
 that's what massive can call 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.680
 material savings thereby are the spd 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.079
 much easier and through this 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.579
 Damping elements offer you first 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.620
 bond but a better feeling for 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.780
 your board without losing the directness 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.040
 At the edge change you lose 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.110
 Can you do it through the channel assembly 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.090
 set exactly the millimeter and the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.890
 angle very exactly what to vary 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.130
 all other system not in year 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.869
 the hook is unfortunately possible est 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.060
 bindings are exclusively compatible 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.030
 for burton boards with the channel so 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.039
 however, essien sports also without 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.959
 channel board a sensitive connection to 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.990
 drive has behaved reflex burton the 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.880
 be allowed to provide the bond 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.200
 Same soft ride as an est 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.259
 binding reflex binding however are not 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.670
 limited to easy as channel ports 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.009
 because here's a minimalist up 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.049
 used for fixing whereby reflex 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.099
 on all systems also fits on channel 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.740
 so offered summarized distance in 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.649
 harder than the first reflex est binding 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.299
 fits only exclusively on pcs 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.889
 ports of burton and are very 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.289
 sensitive as well as most accurate too 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.209
 adjust and reflexes are for everyone 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.279
 Educational montage garden and lighter 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.819
 the bond and offer the easy 

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:05.649
 feeling like one is thank you very much 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.939
 for the attention to our 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.659
 bond zloty calls get over 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.659
