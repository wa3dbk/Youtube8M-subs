00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.010
 developed by software in collaboration with japan studio on 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.309
 bloodborne is one of the most anticipated exclusive playstation 4s for this 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.430
 first part of the year collecting the legacy of the two dark 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.720
 souls is the creative vision of diet that miyazaki the title debuts on the market 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.239
 full of expectations and ready to satisfy the cravings of blackburn fans will not have the 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.590
 brand of the souls saga but all the effects it represents an extension more 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.180
 that a sequel is a parallel way that between software has decided to trace 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.660
 moving slightly away from the rhythms of his previous work but without betraying it 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.230
 in short, in the basic structure in front we find an arpeggios action 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.120
 violent bad a title that requires a complete dedication do not get 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.329
 deceive from those who told of an alleged lowering of the difficulty 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.769
 because blackburn is a prohibitive game in the strictest sense of the word yes 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.429
 they will feel at home with the veterans of the series and will discover a system at times 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.640
 family with some substantial difference is able to give the game 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.050
 a new aftertaste from the beginning, in fact, a change of the perception is perceived 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.070
 gameplay the idea of ​​focusing almost entirely on rapid action and 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.150
 hammering is a direct consequence of the new iconography that abandons the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.450
 all the medieval influences to take us into a whirlpool of architecture 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.010
 in short, the mythology of archery magicians and knights is lost here 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.430
 the hunter's macro class is set by the player, a predator 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.390
 quick and ruthless to fight openly and in short an imperative 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.260
 you have to choose your own weapon from a fairly small number and then 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.470
 metabolize the animations of both its forms 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.160
 the attack keys become three, the mou set widens and the clash with the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.820
 creatures of arnhem turns into a stringent operation on the rhythms of the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.290
 shots and assaults you will have to learn to take advantage of the dodges they replace 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.040
 the somersault when the view pasted on an enemy and using with the right 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.120
 timing a firearm it will be possible to perform a counter that can result in 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.850
 a bloody attack the result is a system of 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.080
 much more tense nervous and sometimes technical fighting that removes the securities 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.319
 of the player and forces him to face threats quickly 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.000
 and decided considering that the number of suits and weapons is very small 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.730
 first it seems that verona blood is a less complex and stratified product 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.879
 of its predecessors and instead there is only need to discover 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.750
 all the consequences of a new and intelligent system that uses the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.709
 statistics in a very creative way and allows you to create hybrid characters 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.579
 even the system of firearms is concentrated on firearms or support spells 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.700
 weapon enhancement that uses some runes that alter them 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 features adds a waiting depth who in short expected one 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.560
 integral clone of souls must think again by breaking down some of the 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.010
 pillars on which the gameplay of its previous productions was held and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.000
 reinforcing instead other miyazaki has created a game with a new flavor but 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.959
 usual succeeding in the enterprise to find a strong originality in the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.049
 conservation the hunter's dream is a kind of 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.519
 central joint that has the same function as the nexus demon's souls andirivieni 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.780
 between this dream cemetery and the city of harlan, however, does not stifle the level 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.829
 design that actually reaches and exceeds the qualitative peaks of the first dark souls 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.579
 the urgency to return often in the dream unfortunately forces a 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.150
 to confront frankly unacceptable loading times 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.989
 the fragmentation of the game rhythm that follows and at times nagging and is 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.690
 undoubtedly the most annoying consequence of a process 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.919
 not exactly exemplary optimization of the adventure of blood marne in any case 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.400
 it is certainly shorter than that of dark souls two very much 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.290
 condensed but fortunately punctuated by boss fight almost always inspired 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.010
 however, the gaming experience does not end at the end of the adventure 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.159
 not only because the title is full of secrets but also for the new system 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.370
 of skies stagion that represents a content and game 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.479
 from the immense extension the level design of the angels or certainly less 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.930
 complex compared to that of the city but certainly not poor in stimuli 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.229
 in addition to secret rooms and clashes with unpublished boxwoods there is the possibility of 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.739
 general procedural structures in which to get lost for hours 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.010
 the extent of the potential of cherries dungeons is truly enormous 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.090
 despite some limitations of cooperative multiplayer the one related to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.290
 chalices is a gaming experience comparable to a parallel adventure i 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.799
 loading times are not the only flaw in the technical sector of blackburn 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.970
 also the framerate must be counted among the problems of production there are not 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.110
 never tremendous excesses but rarely fluidity can be said to be solid and constant 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.320
 for the rest the glance holds the comparison with the next gen 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.660
 it does not lack any less defined texture but the atmosphere and the band 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.920
 the details compensating abundantly the small structures the scene results 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.120
 overall very clean also thanks to an antialiasing filter 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.930
 effective even if not at the top of exclusive production on playstation 4 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.170
 the excellence of the blackburn look in any case is declined through his 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.770
 beautiful architecture, beautiful views and terrible work 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.790
 stylistic is mastodontic and voracious the suggestions of matrix are favored 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.750
 Lovecraftian the iconography of the Victorian era the fascinations of art 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.280
 Gothic delivering cells in a corrupt version and depraved this environment 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.850
 lost manifests itself through a tremendous concert of screams of cries and 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.490
 deaf shots are in the course of boss battles 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.290
 the musical accompaniment goes up the player exasperates his tension on 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.920
 Italian dubbing is of good quality and the publisher's production commitment is not 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.110
 can only be appreciated in the complete rejection of the fantasy in his 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.710
 ability to cling to the mythology of a Victorian city and corrupt it 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.340
 entirely with the smell of blood is perhaps the most evident size of 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.030
 blackburn the ruthless coherence with which miyazaki has carried on his 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.750
 vision then comes to affect the game mechanisms to rewrite the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.840
 system of classes and the mechanics that were at the base of the license plate saga 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.650
 from software to give us a title that is familiar in the structure but 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.010
 new rhythms, in short, everything to discover also because it is professed 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.360
 expert connoisseur of the solis net of some technical stumbling block and 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.419
 that masterpiece of malice that the development team had promised to 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.970
 playstation 4 remains a difficult title to approach 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.300
 for those who have never faced a similar experience with one 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.810
 punitive progression and at times frustrating but it is so easy to finish 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.740
 captured by its spiral of violence and sacrifice and is so fascinating 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.010
 its iconography that we would suggest everyone to do at least one test
