00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
better than just boring all right now

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
better than just boring all right now
for<00:01:27.540> starters<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> simple<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.579> has<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
for starters it just the simple it has a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
for starters it just the simple it has a
rental<00:01:30.420> sprocket<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:32.479> rental<00:01:33.479> chain<00:01:33.930> I'm

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
assuming because like we haven't changed

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.789 
assuming because like we haven't changed
yet<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.810> i'm<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> DI<00:01:37.710> d

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
yet but i'm probably going to get a DI d

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.030 
yet but i'm probably going to get a DI d
chain<00:01:38.869> front<00:01:39.869> sprocket<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.829> either

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
chain front sprocket don't know either

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.389 
chain front sprocket don't know either
because<00:01:41.759> i<00:01:41.909> haven't<00:01:42.090> changed<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.720> yet<00:01:43.399> i

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
because i haven't changed that up yet i

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.950 
because i haven't changed that up yet i
just<00:01:45.090> put<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> new<00:01:45.420> maxis<00:01:46.079> tire<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:47.960> to

four hours on the rear tire and then

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
four hours on the rear tire and then
it's<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> new<00:01:54.930> front<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.740> as

a<00:02:46.310> psycho<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:47.970> how<00:02:48.060> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
a psycho I think that's how you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.800 
a psycho I think that's how you
pronounce<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:49.640> pro<00:02:50.640> armor<00:02:50.910> skid<00:02:51.330> plate<00:02:51.630> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
pronounce it a pro armor skid plate and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.270 
pronounce it a pro armor skid plate and
everything<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.110> covers<00:02:52.799> pretty<00:02:53.040> much

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
everything just covers pretty much

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.789 
everything just covers pretty much
everything<00:02:53.880> rather<00:02:54.239> than<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.019> case

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
everything rather than just the case

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.089 
everything rather than just the case
itself<00:02:56.340> um<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:58.709> great<00:03:00.140> yeah<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.920> has

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
itself um really great yeah and it has

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.220

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
know and as i said i bought this used so

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.159 
know and as i said i bought this used so
i<00:05:08.900> don't<00:05:09.650> really<00:05:09.830> know<00:05:09.950> any<00:05:10.610> like<00:05:11.390> engine<00:05:11.990> work

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
i don't really know any like engine work

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.330 
i don't really know any like engine work
that<00:05:12.380> might<00:05:12.560> have<00:05:12.680> been<00:05:12.710> done<00:05:12.919> like<00:05:13.100> any

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
that might have been done like any

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.900 
that might have been done like any
porting<00:05:13.850> or<00:05:14.090> if<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:15.230> has<00:05:15.260> like<00:05:15.830> hot<00:05:16.160> cam<00:05:16.430> valves

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
porting or if it has like hot cam valves

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.230

here<00:05:20.360> we<00:05:20.600> have<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.260> Hammerhead<00:05:21.770> holeshot

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
here we have the Hammerhead holeshot

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.890 
here we have the Hammerhead holeshot
device<00:05:22.580> it's<00:05:22.820> one<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.180> older<00:05:23.479> styles

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
device it's one of the older styles

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.380 
device it's one of the older styles
which<00:05:24.290> I<00:05:24.410> mean<00:05:24.590> it's<00:05:25.520> not<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.820> greatest<00:05:26.090> in

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
which I mean it's not the greatest in

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.580 
which I mean it's not the greatest in
the<00:05:26.419> world<00:05:26.510> but<00:05:26.870> it's<00:05:27.080> better<00:05:27.260> than<00:05:27.350> a

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
the world but it's better than a

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.159 
the world but it's better than a
holeshot<00:05:27.830> device<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:28.370> know<00:05:28.720> rather<00:05:29.720> compared

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
holeshot device you know rather compared

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.500 
holeshot device you know rather compared
to<00:05:30.229> my<00:05:30.320> old<00:05:30.350> one<00:05:30.740> I'm<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:32.080> 2000<00:05:33.080> 50<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.120> pretty

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
to my old one I'm a 2000 50 and I pretty

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.550 
to my old one I'm a 2000 50 and I pretty
much<00:05:35.660> think<00:05:36.169> that's<00:05:36.669> it<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:38.750> do<00:05:39.020> with<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.320> bike

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
much think that's it to do with the bike

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.500 
much think that's it to do with the bike
so<00:05:41.080> yeah<00:05:42.080> but<00:05:42.620> as<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.979> said<00:05:43.040> so<00:05:43.490> overall<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.240> lot

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
so yeah but as I said so overall a lot

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.219 
so yeah but as I said so overall a lot
better<00:05:44.750> than<00:05:45.320> 0<00:05:45.650> 5<00:05:46.040> because<00:05:46.660> 05<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:47.690> didn't<00:05:48.110> have

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
better than 0 5 because 05 I didn't have

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.490 
better than 0 5 because 05 I didn't have
the<00:05:48.410> steering<00:05:48.860> dampener<00:05:49.540> it<00:05:50.540> was<00:05:50.870> carburetor
