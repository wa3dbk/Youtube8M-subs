uncle it's four years more so then I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.929 
uncle it's four years more so then I
divided<00:00:23.420> 325<00:00:24.420> which<00:00:24.660> gave<00:00:24.840> me<00:00:24.869> 25<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
divided 325 which gave me 25 and then I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.459 
divided 325 which gave me 25 and then I
subtracted<00:00:27.599> 25<00:00:28.470> by<00:00:28.949> 79<00:00:32.809> very<00:00:33.809> nice<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> what

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
subtracted 25 by 79 very nice and what

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.190 
subtracted 25 by 79 very nice and what
is<00:00:34.620> K<00:00:34.890> equals<00:00:34.920> 25<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> 25<00:00:36.570> represent

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is K equals 25 what is 25 represent

you please 2 k plus 4 plus X and Engels
step<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.909> half<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.960> divide<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.890> put

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
step in half and then up I divide I put

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
step in half and then up I divide I put
it<00:01:29.340> negative<00:01:29.700> 4<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> other<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:31.799> negative

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it negative 4 to the other side negative

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.480 
it negative 4 to the other side negative
4<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.640> scratch<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.479> put<00:01:33.840> 2<00:01:34.200> k<00:01:34.500> plus<00:01:35.070> x

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
4 or scratch that out I put 2 k plus x

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
4 or scratch that out I put 2 k plus x
equals<00:01:36.450> 7/5<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.799> added<00:01:38.040> salt<00:01:38.850> give<00:01:39.630> me<00:01:39.840> 3k

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
equals 7/5 and I added salt give me 3k

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.749 
equals 7/5 and I added salt give me 3k
equals<00:01:41.189> 75<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.979> then<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
equals 75 so then I put up that I then I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.990 
equals 75 so then I put up that I then I
divide<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.750> three<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.320> 75<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.579> got<00:01:47.759> K

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
divide it with three was 75 then I got K

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
divide it with three was 75 then I got K
equals<00:01:48.270> 25<00:01:48.689> okay<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.890> sounds<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
equals 25 okay so it kind of sounds like

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
equals 25 okay so it kind of sounds like
just<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> said<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.659> focused<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> Kyoko

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just like you said you focused on Kyoko

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.499 
just like you said you focused on Kyoko

right<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:59.010> divine<00:02:59.370> okay<00:03:00.030> let's<00:03:00.239> look<00:03:00.420> at<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
right you divine okay let's look at the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.259 
right you divine okay let's look at the
different<00:03:01.170> strategies<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.090> good

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
different strategies it's a good

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.030 
different strategies it's a good
approach<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.319> don't<00:03:04.620> know<00:03:04.709> if<00:03:04.800> it's<00:03:04.920> gonna

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
approach but I don't know if it's gonna

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.430 
approach but I don't know if it's gonna
give<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.760> divide<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:07.050> that's

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
give you you divide it here and that's

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.610 
give you you divide it here and that's
how<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.590> got<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.980> good<00:03:08.959> then<00:03:09.959> y'all<00:03:10.170> explain

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
how you got it good then y'all explain

subtracted what she got for their King

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.199 
subtracted what she got for their King
and<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:44.580> gives<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.910> 54<00:03:45.690> which<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:49.280> okay<00:03:50.280> all

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and it gives you 54 which is okay all

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.729 
and it gives you 54 which is okay all
right<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.900> next<00:03:52.170> I'll<00:03:52.260> call<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.560> your

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
right so now or next I'll call on your

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.320 
right so now or next I'll call on your
partner<00:03:53.190> Annabella<00:03:53.580> here<00:03:53.849> let's<00:03:54.150> try<00:03:54.239> to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
partner Annabella here let's try to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.790 
partner Annabella here let's try to
figure<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.750> out<00:03:54.930> okay<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:01.410> show<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
figure this out okay so show the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.500 
figure this out okay so show the
subtraction<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.520> side<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.180> can<00:04:03.300> find

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
subtraction on the side so we can find

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.330 
subtraction on the side so we can find
the<00:04:03.630> difference<00:04:03.840> what's<00:04:04.260> left<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:04.680> because

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the difference what's left over because

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.960 
the difference what's left over because
that<00:04:05.550> must<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.590> Daniella<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:08.190> we<00:04:08.340> subtracted

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
that must be Daniella if we subtracted

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.879 
that must be Daniella if we subtracted
the<00:04:09.090> difference<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:10.850> answer<00:04:11.850> must<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.209> what

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:30.890 

that's<00:04:16.889> right<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.340> age<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.669> Toshihiko<00:04:29.900> look

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
that's right the age of Toshihiko look

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.770 
that's right the age of Toshihiko look
