really<00:00:43.970> makes<00:00:44.150> sense<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.540> me<00:00:44.660> but<00:00:44.810> anyway

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
really makes sense to me but anyway

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.940 
really makes sense to me but anyway
that's<00:00:45.650> what's<00:00:45.890> that's<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.130> point<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:48.830> do

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
that's what's that's the point and to do

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.240 
that's what's that's the point and to do
that<00:00:49.130> he<00:00:49.370> kills<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.790> man<00:00:50.290> named<00:00:51.290> Lord<00:00:51.740> Hideyoshi
