now inside the walkie dog leash itself
is<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.110> internal<00:01:13.560> shock-absorbing<00:01:14.310> system

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
is an internal shock-absorbing system

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.180 
is an internal shock-absorbing system
which<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.619> active<00:01:16.830> dog

which if you have a very active dog

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.980 
which if you have a very active dog
that's<00:01:17.490> running<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.910> lot<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.539> gonna<00:01:18.660> give<00:01:18.899> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
that's running a lot it's gonna give you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.480 
that's running a lot it's gonna give you
a<00:01:19.050> lot<00:01:19.289> of<00:01:19.320> shock<00:01:19.649> absorption

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a lot of shock absorption

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.200 
a lot of shock absorption
he's<00:01:21.030> running<00:01:21.300> alongside<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> let's<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.179> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
he's running alongside so let's take a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
he's running alongside so let's take a
look<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.659> inside<00:01:25.050> at<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
look at the inside at that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
look at the inside at that
shock-absorbing<00:01:26.940> system<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.539> unscrew

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
shock-absorbing system so you unscrew

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.749 
shock-absorbing system so you unscrew
the<00:01:27.990> cap<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:30.800> if<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:31.890> pull<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.190> out<00:01:32.310> you'll

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the cap here if you pull it out you'll

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.520 
the cap here if you pull it out you'll
see<00:01:32.909> there's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.149> set<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> three<00:01:33.780> springs<00:01:34.289> here

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
see there's a set of three springs here

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.290 
see there's a set of three springs here
and<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.149> use<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.440> three<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.270> just

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
and you can use all three two or just

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.540 
and you can use all three two or just
one<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> springs<00:01:40.319> determine<00:01:40.860> depending

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
one of the springs determine depending

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.820 
one of the springs determine depending
on<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:41.850> how<00:01:42.750> long<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.080> want<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.289> leash<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> be

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
on how how long you want the leash to be

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.529 
on how how long you want the leash to be
coming<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> end<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.240> depends

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
coming up the end so it really depends

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.020 
coming up the end so it really depends
on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> size<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.080> your<00:01:46.170> dog<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> 75

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
on the size of your dog I have a 75

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
on the size of your dog I have a 75
pound<00:01:48.300> labs<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.020> use<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
pound labs that I use this with and I

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.160 
pound labs that I use this with and I
tend<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> use<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.210> three<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.719> lead<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
tend to use all three of the lead of the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
tend to use all three of the lead of the
spring<00:01:55.170> systems<00:01:55.619> gives<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> shock

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
spring systems gives you a lot of shock

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.120 
spring systems gives you a lot of shock
absorption<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.689> makes<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> first<00:01:58.140> smoother<00:01:58.500> I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.350 

now<00:02:02.130> sold<00:02:02.399> separately<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.090> what's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
now sold separately there's what's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
now sold separately there's what's
referred<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.289> walkie<00:02:04.590> Dog<00:02:04.740> lowrider

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
referred to as the walkie Dog lowrider

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.039

so<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> lower<00:02:06.539> center<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.930> gravity

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
so if you want a lower center of gravity

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.160 
so if you want a lower center of gravity
to<00:02:08.009> attach<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.459> walkie<00:02:08.700> dog<00:02:08.970> leash<00:02:09.329> to<00:02:09.630> you
