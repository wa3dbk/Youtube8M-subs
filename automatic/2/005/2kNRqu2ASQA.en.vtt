00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
a little bit intentionally to bring the

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.160 
a little bit intentionally to bring the
red<00:02:26.510> match<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:27.079> I<00:02:27.489> turn<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.670> cloner<00:02:28.969> here<00:02:29.299> I'm

gonna<00:02:30.349> put<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> into<00:02:30.829> track<00:02:31.189> mode

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.030 

you<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.700> hear<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:37.440> kind<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.710> watching

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
you can hear it's kind of watching

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.350 
you can hear it's kind of watching
something<00:02:38.280> else<00:02:38.490> when<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> did<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.120> really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
something else when I did that it really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.450 
something else when I did that it really
mean<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.810> at<00:02:39.930> 5,500<00:02:40.590> rpms<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> can

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
mean to put it at 5,500 rpms but you can

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.130 
mean to put it at 5,500 rpms but you can
see<00:02:41.610> how<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.850> goes<00:02:42.000> up<00:02:42.030> there<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.930> then<00:02:43.050> you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
see how it goes up there and then you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.190 
see how it goes up there and then you
have<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:43.470> lateral<00:02:44.040> G<00:02:44.820> meter<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.660> showing<00:02:46.050> you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
have your lateral G meter of showing you

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.030 
have your lateral G meter of showing you
where<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.220> gravity<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:49.170> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
where the gravity is going to on the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.250 
where the gravity is going to on the
vehicle

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.929 

I'm<00:02:55.799> gonna<00:02:55.950> let<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.159> rest<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.640> play<00:02:56.909> out

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
I'm gonna let the rest of this play out

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.319 
I'm gonna let the rest of this play out
with<00:02:57.239> no<00:02:57.450> audio<00:02:58.439> and<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.000> way<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> can

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
with no audio and so that way you can

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.360 
with no audio and so that way you can
watch<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.900> want<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.409> or<00:03:01.680> fast-forward

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
watch it if you want to or fast-forward

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.649 
watch it if you want to or fast-forward
to<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.670> end<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> video<00:03:03.420> because<00:03:03.599> I'm

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
to the end of the video because I'm

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.360 
to the end of the video because I'm
going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> show<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.110> other<00:03:04.260> video<00:03:04.470> showing

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
going to show one other video showing

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.759 
going to show one other video showing
the<00:03:06.209> brake<00:03:06.480> pedals<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.110> stuff<00:03:07.319> up<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.680> at

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the brake pedals and stuff up there at

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.520 
the brake pedals and stuff up there at
the<00:03:07.829> top<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.720> with<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> track<00:03:10.110> mode<00:03:10.349> and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
the top so with the track mode and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.809 
the top so with the track mode and
forgot<00:03:10.739> about<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:10.950> with<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> track<00:03:11.579> mode

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
forgot about that with the track mode

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.539 
forgot about that with the track mode
you<00:03:11.970> do<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.200> green<00:03:13.890> brake<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
you do have the the green brake and the

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.110 
you do have the the green brake and the
red<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.239> green<00:03:15.840> gas<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.650> red<00:03:17.190> brake<00:03:17.519> as

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
red the green gas and the red brake as

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.270 
red the green gas and the red brake as
well<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:19.079> last<00:03:19.319> one<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.769> perform<00:03:20.129> its

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
well this last one is to perform its

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.750 
well this last one is to perform its
timing<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.959> tells<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.440> your<00:03:22.950> zero<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.310> 60

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
timing so this tells you your zero to 60

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.539 
timing so this tells you your zero to 60
or<00:03:23.790> 0<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.269> 100<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.930> quarter-mile<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.250> 0

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
or 0 to 100 your quarter-mile and your 0

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.170 
or 0 to 100 your quarter-mile and your 0
to<00:03:26.640> 100<00:03:27.150> back<00:03:27.450> down<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.900> zero<00:03:28.640> indication<00:03:29.640> you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to 100 back down to zero indication you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.119 
to 100 back down to zero indication you
cannot<00:03:30.510> watch<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.260> your<00:03:31.379> screen<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.010> this

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
cannot watch this on your screen so this

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.069 
cannot watch this on your screen so this
is<00:03:32.280> strictly<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:32.909> when<00:03:33.389> you<00:03:33.510> get<00:03:33.629> done<00:03:33.870> that

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
is strictly for when you get done that

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.369 
is strictly for when you get done that
you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.409> review<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:34.859> as<00:03:35.370> well<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.209> coming<00:03:37.200> up

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
you can review it as well and coming up

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.680 
you can review it as well and coming up
here<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> really<00:03:37.889> wish<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.159> would<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.340> had<00:03:38.940> back

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
there was a pothole that I wanted to

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.369 
there was a pothole that I wanted to
avoid<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.720> could<00:03:45.840> have<00:03:45.930> seen<00:03:46.079> how<00:03:46.230> much

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
avoid and you could have seen how much

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.289 
avoid and you could have seen how much
gee<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.709> did<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> moved<00:03:47.579> around<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
gee I did when I moved around that

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.330 
gee I did when I moved around that
