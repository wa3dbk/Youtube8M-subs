bottles and like I've described in
previous<00:02:51.019> videos<00:02:51.730> those<00:02:52.730> little<00:02:53.000> buckets<00:02:53.450> on

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
previous videos those little buckets on

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.740 
previous videos those little buckets on
the<00:02:53.750> left<00:02:53.989> are<00:02:54.769> facing<00:02:55.310> upwards<00:02:55.760> at<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:56.540> type

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the left are facing upwards at this type

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.970 
the left are facing upwards at this type
of<00:02:56.900> angle<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.769> when<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:57.980> put<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:59.000> plaster<00:02:59.629> on

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
of angle so when I put that plaster on

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.650 
of angle so when I put that plaster on
plus<00:03:00.980> here<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.370> goes<00:03:01.609> up<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.299> sets

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
plus here it goes up and then it sets

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.110 
plus here it goes up and then it sets
back<00:03:02.930> down<00:03:03.170> into<00:03:03.650> those<00:03:03.769> buckets<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.579> that's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
back down into those buckets and that's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.830 
back down into those buckets and that's
what's<00:03:05.359> holding<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.989> wall<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.750> I'm

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
what's holding it on the wall so I'm

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.839 
what's holding it on the wall so I'm
just<00:03:08.930> gonna<00:03:09.049> continue<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.069> until<00:03:10.760> I

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
just gonna continue on with this until I

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.849 
just gonna continue on with this until I
have<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> good<00:03:11.329> amount<00:03:11.540> done<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.139> then<00:03:12.709> I'll

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
have a good amount done and then I'll

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.430 
have a good amount done and then I'll
show<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.069> how<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.340> scratch<00:03:13.639> it<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.349> you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
show you how to scratch it now if you

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.620 
show you how to scratch it now if you
can<00:03:15.680> use<00:03:15.889> the<00:03:16.069> trowel<00:03:16.310> but<00:03:16.639> maybe<00:03:17.329> this<00:03:17.510> is

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
can use the trowel but maybe this is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.750 
can use the trowel but maybe this is
just<00:03:17.660> my<00:03:17.930> experience<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.859> find<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.609> a<00:03:19.639> lot

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
just my experience I find it a lot

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.180 
just my experience I find it a lot
easier<00:03:19.819> for<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.480> scratch<00:03:20.690> coat<00:03:20.959> just<00:03:21.829> use<00:03:22.040> my

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
easier for the scratch coat just use my

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.629 
easier for the scratch coat just use my
hand<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:23.569> so<00:03:26.709> feel<00:03:27.709> like<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:27.919> lose<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.130> lot<00:03:28.400> less

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
hand like so feel like I lose a lot less

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:35.229 
hand like so feel like I lose a lot less
to<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.810> floor<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:32.530> for<00:03:33.530> me<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:35.030> goes<00:03:35.209> a

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
to the to the floor and for me it goes a

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.759 
to the to the floor and for me it goes a
lot<00:03:35.450> faster<00:03:35.750> now<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:37.579> can<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:38.000> here<00:03:38.769> that

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
lot faster now you can see here that

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.479 
lot faster now you can see here that
this<00:03:40.069> bottle<00:03:40.549> is<00:03:42.040> getting<00:03:43.040> covered<00:03:43.310> with<00:03:43.400> a

is<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.170> to<00:04:34.320> need<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.620> stick<00:04:34.980> on<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> wall<00:04:35.930> so

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
is going to need to stick on the wall so

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.540 
is going to need to stick on the wall so
you<00:04:37.140> just<00:04:37.260> apply<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.470> little<00:04:37.710> bit<00:04:37.800> of<00:04:37.980> pressure

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.530 

I'm<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.670> going<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.820> go<00:04:41.940> right<00:04:42.150> over<00:04:42.180> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
I'm just going to go right over the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.400 
I'm just going to go right over the
bottles

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.270 

and<00:04:57.210> continue<00:04:58.210> on<00:05:00.870> call<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:02.020> diamond<00:05:02.470> lab<00:05:02.680> and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
and continue on call it diamond lab and

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.820 
and continue on call it diamond lab and
then<00:05:03.850> we<00:05:04.150> need<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.510> attach<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:05.200> our<00:05:05.260> earth<00:05:05.530> back

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
then we need to attach to our earth back

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.790 
then we need to attach to our earth back
but<00:05:06.610> we've<00:05:06.760> done<00:05:07.000> is<00:05:07.330> yesterday<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:08.350> checked

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
but we've done is yesterday we checked

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.850 
but we've done is yesterday we checked
out<00:05:09.360> between<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.600> earth<00:05:10.720> back<00:05:10.990> courses<00:05:11.560> with

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
out between the earth back courses with

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.140 
out between the earth back courses with
a<00:05:12.490> mortar<00:05:13.240> or<00:05:13.270> cement<00:05:13.720> mortar
