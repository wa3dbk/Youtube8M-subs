00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
race after that he was pulling pretty

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.020 
race after that he was pulling pretty
good<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.009> new<00:01:55.189> car<00:01:55.369> we<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:55.520> built<00:01:55.850> him

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
good in that new car we just built him

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.179 
good in that new car we just built him
and<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:56.899> pretty<00:01:57.110> technical<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:57.770> know<00:01:57.799> we're

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
and it's pretty technical you know we're

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.389 
and it's pretty technical you know we're
only<00:01:58.369> about<00:01:58.640> 475<00:01:59.600> 500<00:02:00.530> horse<00:02:00.679> at<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.009> crank

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
only about 475 500 horse at the crank

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.930 
only about 475 500 horse at the crank
and<00:02:01.729> probably<00:02:02.479> about<00:02:02.630> 250<00:02:03.200> at<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.709> tires<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and probably about 250 at the tires and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.940 
and probably about 250 at the tires and
that's<00:02:05.060> probably<00:02:05.659> about<00:02:05.869> 150<00:02:06.590> horsepower

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's probably about 150 horsepower

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.309

less<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.640> lot<00:02:07.759> of<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:07.970> guys<00:02:08.119> out<00:02:08.330> here<00:02:08.660> but

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
less than a lot of the guys out here but

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.630 
less than a lot of the guys out here but
I<00:02:09.530> was<00:02:09.799> kind<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.009> shooting<00:02:10.220> for<00:02:10.459> more

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
I was kind of shooting for more

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.789 
I was kind of shooting for more
reliability<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.569> that's<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.560> race

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
reliability and that's what this race

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.080 
reliability and that's what this race
takes<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.280> reliability

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
takes of reliability

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.479 
takes of reliability
we<00:02:14.810> sat<00:02:15.049> Boulder<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.560> qualifying<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.370> then

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
we sat Boulder and qualifying and then

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.370 
we sat Boulder and qualifying and then
also<00:02:17.090> set<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.540> fastest<00:02:17.870> lap<00:02:17.900> during<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
also set the fastest lap during the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.020 
also set the fastest lap during the
three<00:02:18.560> lengths<00:02:18.769> today<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.099> we're<00:02:19.610> headed<00:02:19.880> into

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
three lengths today so we're headed into

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.729 
three lengths today so we're headed into
the<00:02:20.209> main<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.660> hopefully<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.349> can<00:02:21.440> keep<00:02:21.530> let's

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the main and hopefully we can keep let's

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.990 
the main and hopefully we can keep let's
