00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.560
Come with me. Back to childhood.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.033
The world used to be so easy before schooldays.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.146
You wanted to go so far, along your journey.

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:28.640
As a child, your head was full of possibilities.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.184
As if on clouds you flew above the earth.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.520
The moon stars and sky above you.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.875
Look into the distance. Do you see the light?

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:38.280
And how it breaks when your heart breaks?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.658
Do you see that crap? Down there, on earth?

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.050
Do you see my heritage? It is my grave!

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.418
Nothing remained for me on the day I died

00:00:45.418 --> 00:00:47.833
- except for the ring that I wore until today!

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:50.400
But I know: You don’t see it!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.880
You are too young. So go your way.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.240
Unfortunately it is too late for me.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.678
Head up, my son. I love you!

00:00:57.678 --> 00:01:01.360
There is only one chance. The chance of your life.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.386
Don’t let them get you down or you will never win.

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:11.053
There is only one chance. Take it as long as it’s close.

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:16.626
If not you are going to follow it into your grave.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.180
You grew up so so fast.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.400
Almost graduated high school - 18.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.661
All day you were learning

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.239
because you wanted to become a teacher.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.422
You wanted to climb onto the stars

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.836
so that you could show your friends:

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:33.182
You are are not just an optimist

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.991
- You can be what you are in your head!

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.360
But then Mom divorced from me.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.728
You just couldn’t understand it.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:43.143
Couldn’t take it anymore to be home

00:01:43.143 --> 00:01:45.558
and ran away alone from home!

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:47.787
Do you know what we have gone through?

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.341
How long we’ve been searching for you?

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.501
Mom and I lived for you! 

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:54.920
We only married for you!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.040
There is only one chance. The chance of your life.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.000
Don’t let them get you down or you will never win.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.685
There is only one chance. Take it as long as it’s close.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:14.200
If not you are going to follow it into your grave.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.557
The apartment empty, a letter on the door:

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:19.064
“Come back, son. We’re searching for you!

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:21.280
We reconciled. Don’t want to divorce.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.824
Above that, we swear that we will never fight again.

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:26.262
We have been searching for you for months, day and night.

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.600
We hardly sleep. Our power is draining.”

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.953
Next to it a newspaper article in red:

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:36.280
“Microsleep. Last night: Married couple dead!”

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.865
Enjoy your freedom, son. I will rest in peace from now on.

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:49.120
I didn’t love your mother. But I always loved you.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.040
Son, where are you? Son, where are you?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.580
Come back. My son? My sonnnnnnnnnn!!!

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.270
There is only one chance. The chance of your life.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.280
Don’t let them get you down or you will never win.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.675
There is only one chance. Take it as long as it’s close.

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:20.880
If not you are going to follow it into your grave.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.520
There is only one chance. The chance of your life.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.559
Don’t let them get you down or you will never win.

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:35.017
There is only one chance. Take it as long as it’s close.

00:03:35.017 --> 00:03:40.780
If not you are going to follow it into your grave.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.000
Dedicated to all those who were close, but had to go away.
