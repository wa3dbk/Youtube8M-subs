00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
about 40 i'm pretty sure i know that

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.730 
about 40 i'm pretty sure i know that
will<00:00:12.509> guarantee<00:00:12.660> my<00:00:12.990> plate<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> first<00:00:13.469> place

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
will guarantee my plate a first place

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.020 
will guarantee my plate a first place
but<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.070> mousesports<00:00:14.250> i<00:00:14.670> took<00:00:14.820> around

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
but it's mousesports i took around

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
but it's mousesports i took around
offering<00:00:15.269> very<00:00:15.630> cheekily<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.289> there<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.130> see

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
offering very cheekily and there we see

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.790 
offering very cheekily and there we see
how<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.590> it's<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
how they go here and it's going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.750 
how they go here and it's going to
switch<00:00:20.310> over<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:21.859> follow<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> mage<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.519> time

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
switch over to follow the mage this time

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.900 
switch over to follow the mage this time
alex<00:00:24.660> from<00:00:25.320> mousesports<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.550> almost<00:00:29.670> get

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
alex from mousesports so we almost get

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
alex from mousesports so we almost get
down<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> 15<00:00:30.599> seconds<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> ready<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> mean

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
down to 15 seconds and ready but I mean

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.680 
down to 15 seconds and ready but I mean
there's<00:00:32.579> nothing<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.059> changes<00:00:33.480> here

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there's nothing really changes here

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
there's nothing really changes here
rental<00:00:34.079> order<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.469> surely<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.890> mean<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.280> might

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
rental order and surely I mean we might

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
rental order and surely I mean we might
be<00:00:35.550> able<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.760> run<00:00:36.329> down<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> mayor<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.290> druid

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
be able to run down the mayor the druid

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
be able to run down the mayor the druid
a<00:00:37.590> little<00:00:37.770> bit<00:00:37.860> easier<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.270> wouldn't

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
a little bit easier I mean I wouldn't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.440 
a little bit easier I mean I wouldn't
that<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.110> case<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:41.149> hope<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.300> haven't

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that be the case I hope they haven't

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819 
that be the case I hope they haven't
changed<00:00:42.809> anything<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
changed anything you know that that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.130 
changed anything you know that that
majors<00:00:44.160> frost<00:00:44.460> again<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
majors frost again so as I do see the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
majors frost again so as I do see the
ice<00:00:46.260> barrier<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.579> saw<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.420> massive

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
ice barrier I just saw that the massive

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
ice barrier I just saw that the massive
damage<00:00:49.320> he<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.649> wearing<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> assume<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.280> he

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
damage he was wearing and assume that he

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.950 
damage he was wearing and assume that he
was<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.850> fire<00:00:51.030> again<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.329> guess<00:00:51.930> not

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
was going to be fire again but guess not

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.189 
was going to be fire again but guess not
so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> started<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> fight<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.899> ill

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
so I started the fight we do have as ill

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
so I started the fight we do have as ill
looking<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> actually<00:00:56.850> playing<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
looking to actually playing kind of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.639 
looking to actually playing kind of
defensively<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> start<00:00:58.320> instead<00:00:58.440> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
defensively at the start instead of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.090 
defensively at the start instead of
charging<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.690> might<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.840> afraid<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
charging way in might be afraid that the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.719 
charging way in might be afraid that the
mage<00:01:02.250> might<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> fire<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.030> time<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
mage might be fire this time so I have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
mage might be fire this time so I have
an<00:01:05.850> intervene<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.450> Glick<00:01:07.170> trying<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> stop

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
an intervene on Glick trying to stop

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.910 
an intervene on Glick trying to stop
that<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.330> cheap<00:01:09.540> shot<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:10.740> he'll

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that on the the cheap shot which he'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.830 
that on the the cheap shot which he'll
probably<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.369> intervening<00:01:11.729> every<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
probably be intervening every time that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.320 
probably be intervening every time that
he<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.400> since<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.580> used<00:01:14.790> his<00:01:14.880> blood<00:01:15.150> rage

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
he can since he has used his blood rage

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
he can since he has used his blood rage
at<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.600> point<00:01:15.810> yeah<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.680> again

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
at this point yeah I'm about to do again

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.289 
at this point yeah I'm about to do again
but<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.400> glitched<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.060> moved

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
but it was glitched to actually moved

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.230 
but it was glitched to actually moved
forward<00:01:18.659> offensively<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.580> L<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
forward offensively and as a as L was a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.120 
forward offensively and as a as L was a
kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> hidden<00:01:21.810> behind<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> tomb<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
kind of hidden behind the tomb so it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
kind of hidden behind the tomb so it
could<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.310> been<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.729> nice<00:01:23.850> but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
could have been really nice but

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.240 
could have been really nice but
unfortunately<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.320> wasn't

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.010 

so<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.910> just<00:01:29.150> following<00:01:29.480> Glick<00:01:29.690> says<00:01:29.870> he's

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
so I just following Glick says he's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.420 
so I just following Glick says he's
going<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.200> start<00:01:30.320> dotting<00:01:30.710> up<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> mage<00:01:31.130> then

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
going to start dotting up the mage then

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.120 
going to start dotting up the mage then
and<00:01:32.390> actually<00:01:32.540> managing<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.590> hit<00:01:33.740> quite<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.010> few

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
and actually managing to hit quite a few

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
and actually managing to hit quite a few
you<00:01:34.370> can<00:01:34.490> see<00:01:34.580> siphon<00:01:35.000> life<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.450> corruption

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
you can see siphon life and corruption

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.320 
you can see siphon life and corruption
both<00:01:36.410> on<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.740> mage<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.400> he's<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.820> kind<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.120> a

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
both on the mage and he's just kind of a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.130 
both on the mage and he's just kind of a
running<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.290> out<00:01:40.180> his<00:01:41.180> ice<00:01:41.390> barrier<00:01:41.690> isn't

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
running that out his ice barrier isn't

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.240 
running that out his ice barrier isn't
up<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:42.410> time<00:01:42.620> so<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:42.860> not<00:01:42.979> going<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.160> absorb

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
up this time so it's not going to absorb
