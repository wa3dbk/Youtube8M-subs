00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
like I think even if the the principal

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 
like I think even if the the principal
is<00:01:37.770> telling<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> truth<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> fact

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
is telling the truth I think the fact

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.149 
is telling the truth I think the fact
that<00:01:39.479> people<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:39.990> questioning<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.009> much

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that people are questioning this so much

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.340 
that people are questioning this so much
is<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:42.000> telling<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.540> how<00:01:42.750> they<00:01:42.930> perceive

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is really telling of how they perceive

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
is really telling of how they perceive
school<00:01:43.740> children<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.220> being<00:01:44.520> treated<00:01:44.790> there

of the school lunch and that sparked a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.889 
of the school lunch and that sparked a
hole<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.399> an<00:01:56.490> outrage<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.659> schools

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
they're not really getting them so the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.429

question also is turning to where is the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
question also is turning to where is the
money<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.489> they're<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:08.970> providing
