00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
factory years and years later will build

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.540 
factory years and years later will build
that<00:02:33.000> entire<00:02:33.570> car<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.290> steel<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.310> there's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that entire car and steel so there's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.520 
that entire car and steel so there's
such<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> demand<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> imagine<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
such a demand can you imagine what the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.040 
such a demand can you imagine what the
dyes<00:02:37.740> cost<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.370> do<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.420> they<00:02:39.570> did<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
dyes cost to do that but they did it and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.670 
dyes cost to do that but they did it and
it<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.860> speaks<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.910> highly<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.750> 32<00:02:43.080> forts

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it just speaks so highly of the 32 forts

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.550 
it just speaks so highly of the 32 forts
and<00:02:43.890> how<00:02:43.980> people<00:02:44.370> love<00:02:44.610> them<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.510> guess<00:02:46.230> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and how people love them and I guess it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.280 
and how people love them and I guess it
will<00:02:46.740> never<00:02:46.980> change<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.760> long<00:02:47.820> as<00:02:48.240> there's<00:02:48.630> hot

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
will never change as long as there's hot

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.560 
will never change as long as there's hot
rods<00:02:49.620> they'll<00:02:50.160> always<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:51.080> 32<00:02:52.080> Ford's
