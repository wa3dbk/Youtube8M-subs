00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
a little bit when it comes to plugging

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.200 
a little bit when it comes to plugging
stuff<00:01:10.900> into<00:01:11.259> my<00:01:11.350> tally<00:01:11.619> then<00:01:12.460> what<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.790> actual

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210

book that comes with the headset

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.499 
book that comes with the headset
actually<00:01:15.430> does<00:01:15.579> because<00:01:15.939> they're<00:01:16.210> doing<00:01:16.329> it

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
actually does because they're doing it

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.880

views I'm actually picking up off my
headset<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.560> unboxing<00:05:08.520> sort<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.849> video

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
headset and unboxing sort of video

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.290

hopefully<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.889> guys<00:05:11.490> can<00:05:11.849> put<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.090> same

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
hopefully you guys can put the same

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.510 
hopefully you guys can put the same
interest<00:05:12.690> into<00:05:12.990> my<00:05:13.110> actual<00:05:13.470> gameplay<00:05:13.949> videos

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
interest into my actual gameplay videos

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.219 
interest into my actual gameplay videos
so<00:05:15.210> I'm<00:05:15.300> not<00:05:15.419> really<00:05:15.599> getting<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.930> much

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
so I'm not really getting that much

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.379 
so I'm not really getting that much
interest<00:05:16.620> obviously<00:05:16.979> like<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:17.639> know<00:05:18.120> I'm<00:05:18.180> using

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
interest obviously like I know I'm using

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.790 
interest obviously like I know I'm using
the<00:05:18.509> same<00:05:18.690> chromosome<00:05:19.139> I'm<00:05:19.320> using<00:05:19.530> at<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
the same chromosome I'm using at the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.550 
the same chromosome I'm using at the
moment<00:05:20.300> which<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.479> not<00:05:21.750> really<00:05:22.080> making<00:05:22.319> the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
moment which is not really making the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.939 
moment which is not really making the
best<00:05:22.770> quality<00:05:23.130> videos<00:05:23.430> but<00:05:23.849> I<00:05:24.569> don't<00:05:25.319> see<00:05:25.500> why

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
best quality videos but I don't see why

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.730 
best quality videos but I don't see why
it<00:05:26.789> should<00:05:26.849> make<00:05:27.120> much<00:05:27.330> more<00:05:27.630> difference<00:05:28.050> you

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
it should make much more difference you

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.260 
it should make much more difference you
can<00:05:28.889> star<00:05:29.070> she<00:05:29.280> still<00:05:29.520> like<00:05:29.909> to<00:05:30.000> see<00:05:30.090> what's

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
can star she still like to see what's

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.050 
can star she still like to see what's
going<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:30.630> in<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> gameplay<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.669> do

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
going on in the gameplay and and I do

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.159 
going on in the gameplay and and I do
like<00:05:33.330> comment<00:05:33.570> on<00:05:33.780> what's<00:05:33.990> actually

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
happening sometimes through the gameplay

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.020 
happening sometimes through the gameplay
but<00:05:36.990> hopefully<00:05:37.830> if<00:05:37.979> you<00:05:38.159> guys<00:05:38.460> can<00:05:38.729> actually

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
but hopefully if you guys can actually

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.480 
but hopefully if you guys can actually
get<00:05:39.330> more<00:05:39.570> views<00:05:39.840> on<00:05:39.990> my<00:05:40.169> game<00:05:40.949> playing<00:05:41.219> video
