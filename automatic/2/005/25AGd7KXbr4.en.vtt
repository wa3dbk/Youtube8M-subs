just be overall you know a little bit

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
just be overall you know a little bit
higher<00:01:07.890> quality<00:01:08.369> than<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> extruded

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
higher quality than some of the extruded

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
higher quality than some of the extruded
stuff<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.619> come<00:01:10.830> equipped<00:01:11.159> with<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
stuff this one will come equipped with a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.640 
stuff this one will come equipped with a
two<00:01:11.970> degree<00:01:12.180> base<00:01:12.600> bevel<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.500> degree

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
two degree base bevel and a two degree

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.149 
two degree base bevel and a two degree
side<00:01:14.010> bevel<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.420> much<00:01:15.540> rail<00:01:15.960> ready<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
side bevel so pretty much rail ready you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
side bevel so pretty much rail ready you
might<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> detune<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.930> bit

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
might want to detune a little bit

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.240 
might want to detune a little bit
between<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> bindings<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.040> i<00:01:20.070> definitely

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
between the bindings but i definitely

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
between the bindings but i definitely
recommend<00:01:20.490> taking<00:01:20.909> out<00:01:21.240> riding<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.140> first<00:01:22.409> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
recommend taking out riding it first and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
recommend taking out riding it first and
see<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> catch<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.850> already

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
see if you catch because it is already

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
see if you catch because it is already
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> set<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> rails<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
kind of set up to do the rails in the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.090 
kind of set up to do the rails in the
boxes<00:01:26.900> flexing<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
boxes flexing this one one of the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
boxes flexing this one one of the
reasons<00:01:29.189> why<00:01:29.430> i<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
reasons why i like it it's right in the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.580 
reasons why i like it it's right in the
