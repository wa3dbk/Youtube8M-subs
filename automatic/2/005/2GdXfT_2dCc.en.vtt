00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.670 
different though I think I like the old
the<00:01:22.860> old<00:01:23.040> sound<00:01:23.400> better<00:01:25.460> clap<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.689> move

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the old sound better clap and move

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.210 
the old sound better clap and move
around<00:01:30.079> let's<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.409> stick<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.650> four<00:01:31.979> frames

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.390 
around let's just stick with four frames
and<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> also<00:01:34.439> comes<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.070> gallery

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and then it also comes with the gallery

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.520 
and then it also comes with the gallery
as<00:01:35.579> well<00:01:36.530> let's<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.710> ahead<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.970> here
