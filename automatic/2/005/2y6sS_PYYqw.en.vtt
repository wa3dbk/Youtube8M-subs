Archimedes<00:01:04.680> realized<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.549> an<00:01:05.640> inclined

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
Archimedes realized that an inclined

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
Archimedes realized that an inclined
plane<00:01:06.119> wrapped<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.350> pole<00:01:07.380> made<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.890 

our<00:01:32.640> comedians<00:01:33.640> invented<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.270> Archimedes

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
our comedians invented the Archimedes

our comedians invented the Archimedes
screw<00:01:35.049> this<00:01:35.619> was<00:01:35.890> used<00:01:36.250> originally<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.210> pump

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
screw this was used originally to pump

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.639 
screw this was used originally to pump
water<00:01:37.750> or<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.470> our<00:01:38.560> case<00:01:38.590> kool-aid<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.500> can

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
water or in our case kool-aid as you can

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.340 
water or in our case kool-aid as you can
see<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.610> kool-aid<00:01:46.030> moves<00:01:46.240> up<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.479> Archimedes

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
see the kool-aid moves up the Archimedes

00:01:47.350 --> 00:02:03.450 
see the kool-aid moves up the Archimedes
screw<00:01:47.440> or<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.369> inclined<00:01:48.729> plane<00:02:02.460> eventually
