00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:10.830
 [Music] 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.400
 dear friends of the sale 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.029
 Now you are in a state of motion 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.750
 where you already know how 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 hypothetical immovable 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.430
 Treatment techniques feel like a lot 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.430
 it is possible you are no longer a beginner 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 why is there a senior ? 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.809
 status a whole series of trainings 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.129
 your skills in things 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.530
 further reinforce further treatment 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.480
 Remove 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.380
 two reasons i want you to be flexible 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 and i want that seller in the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.120
 Location are on www type of situation 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 every fault in every resistance in 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.090
 the appropriate way to respond 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.810
 can and everyone's perfect 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.640
 inherent positive energy in deadlines 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.690
 and statements can transform the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.399
 will not always succeed but more often 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.580
 you succeed that opens the succeed 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.550
 the more you reach this goal the more 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.140
 more love and contentment and inner 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.720
 connectedness what else sell 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.569
 and that's what it is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.530
 what we all aim for 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:40.740
 the desire to do something and who stands and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.459
 also coincides with the quote with the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.970
 Success rate less you one 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.840
 Resistances fail you are proud you are 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.910
 on what you have done 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.009
 attitudes helps you so with 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.590
 objections to deal with in a relaxed manner in the future 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.530
 that will be a very interesting question 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.810
 very strong in this training 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.789
 Focus back because you have the now 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.660
 first experiences made what happened 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.380
 when I start 4 5 6 7 8 techniques 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.450
 fire 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 what about me what does my system say 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.140
 an ethical-moral inner voice 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.069
 when is the conclusion what is unabashed and 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.909
 how do you actually get the idea 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.470
 that you are way too energetic and 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.110
 push because I hear that sometimes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.300
 if seller is able to do so 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.980
 will fire several techniques 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.650
 that they then have internal contradictions too 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.100
 have overcome that is not loud 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.960
 so pushy and though you often do it 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.930
 that maybe even in the 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.660
 tenth start suddenly you crack the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.010
 customer and he has convinced himself 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.440
 because John stayed with him and him 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.190
 Supports a new way of looking at it 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:05.320
 so do you create in conversations there 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:10.180
 further you come so far still fails 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.850
 is still threatened though that out 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.450
 once you have checked this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.600
 I can also do it 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.330
 that you start now is massive 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.470
 Breaking resistance and the customer 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.730
 still pull the spell 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.880
 I want you to have your own 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.970
 imbue cybernetics a routine 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.470
 developed and the techniques to intuitively 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.010
 walls is where you are now 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.900
 have choices 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.200
 I want you to be able 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.800
 develops various techniques 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.440
 automatically the respective situation 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.640
 properly adapt it to smart 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.100
 combine 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.739
 I want that whole conviction 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.239
 Strictly automatic automatically without 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.550
 think what am I doing right now than 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.070
 Next, then, a quick wit 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.090
 develops the not hurt but 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.269
 Good feelings generated and constructive 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 evokes states in the brain of the customer 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.310
 that encourage him to step into the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.870
 to go to contract 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:23.200
 five more techniques are waiting for you 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.740
 a brilliant as the next one I have 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.740
 no time 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.080
 no time 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.120
 no time 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.970
 So what I am about is that me 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.740
 now for financial investments now in the customer 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.720
 we have nothing left 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.380
 only recently a report in the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.759
 newspaper was seen and clearly 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.500
 to invest shares 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.300
 I think that's not right for you 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.449
 What did I do? 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.789
 I have one of the great skills 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.940
 played out the many sellers a lot 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.449
 much demanded then to be silent if 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.110
 usually the rest of the world speak 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.449
 would and this silence you will become 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.539
 with reliable accuracy itself 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.509
 It is always that experience 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.979
 he causes silence 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.289
 maybe he was not clear to me 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:37.360
 there must be something on it, yes then 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.770
 with a new extended statement 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.560
 to provide more information in the 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.300
 case 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.500
 More concrete information we had 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.639
 already one or the other experience 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.380
 or a press review has us as well 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:53.419
 to believe in it for the moment 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.720
 donate the risk we have 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.830
 certain reservations with this 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.610
 Information you can again the lever 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.440
 fix 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.050
 she gives the next step before then 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.930
 It is so important to them that I them 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.880
 Shares show the completely different 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.560
 The funds work though the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.560
 times are a bit more difficult though 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:25.699
 anyway and especially for that reason 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:29.030
 worked well although yes how should 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.130
 because they would like to go that 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.900
 that works while already one 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.479
 perfect treatment technology the motive 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.210
 have been that from a control technology 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:42.500
 module what you can visit soon you 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.039

 and I do not want to stand here 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:53.330
 More betray that the simplest 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:56.140
 The five new techniques have been the 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:05.870
 you get to know this module 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:07.640
 keep silent oh god silent 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.150
 Of course only if it is appropriate 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.320
 is 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.330
 you may already have wondered 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.790
