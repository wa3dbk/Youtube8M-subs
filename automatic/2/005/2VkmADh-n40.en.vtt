they<00:02:24.960> cost<00:02:25.140> about<00:02:25.290> $180<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.730> it's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
they cost about $180 which I know it's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.070 
they cost about $180 which I know it's
quite<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> bit<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> knife<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.050> this

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
quite a bit for a knife like this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.840 
quite a bit for a knife like this
especially<00:02:28.650> considering<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.430> produced<00:02:29.700> in

especially considering it's produced in
Taichung<00:02:30.240> Taiwan<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.370> fairly

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
Taichung Taiwan but it is a fairly

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the materials are very nice now this is

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.309 
the materials are very nice now this is
a<00:02:39.959> CTS<00:02:40.620> xhp<00:02:41.190> blade<00:02:41.750> that's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.900> steel<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.200> I've

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
a CTS xhp blade that's a steel that I've

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.860 
a CTS xhp blade that's a steel that I've
been<00:02:43.410> using<00:02:43.560> considerably<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.450> know<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.600> use<00:02:45.840> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
been using considerably you know I use a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.900 
been using considerably you know I use a
considerable<00:02:46.380> amount<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
considerable amount of it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.850 
considerable amount of it
in<00:02:46.970> my<00:02:47.090> own<00:02:47.210> custom<00:02:47.570> lives<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.590> think<00:02:48.740> it's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
in my own custom lives and I think it's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.790 
in my own custom lives and I think it's
a<00:02:48.890> great<00:02:49.010> steal<00:02:49.280> it's<00:02:49.610> kind<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.650> a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
a great steal it's kind of like a it's a

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.980 
a great steal it's kind of like a it's a
carpenter<00:02:52.250> steal<00:02:52.460> but<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.360> sort<00:02:53.930> of

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
carpenter steal but it is sort of

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.660 
carpenter steal but it is sort of
property<00:02:54.440> wise<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.620> little<00:02:55.130> bit<00:02:55.250> like<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> cross

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
property wise a little bit like a cross

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.180 
property wise a little bit like a cross
between<00:02:55.700> 440<00:02:56.480> C<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.750> D<00:02:56.900> -<00:02:57.110> that's<00:02:58.010> how<00:02:58.160> I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
between 440 C and D - that's how I

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.450 
between 440 C and D - that's how I
describe<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.970> it's<00:02:59.480> got<00:02:59.630> good<00:02:59.780> results<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:01.220> at

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
describe it it's got good results but at

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.040 
describe it it's got good results but at
the<00:03:01.550> same<00:03:01.670> time<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.120> actually<00:03:02.480> wears<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:03.020> a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
the same time it actually wears like a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.350 
the same time it actually wears like a
tool<00:03:03.260> steel<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.490> very<00:03:04.730> very<00:03:04.910> nice<00:03:05.030> and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
tool steel so it's a very very nice and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120 
tool steel so it's a very very nice and
steel<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:06.470> think<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.770> there<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:06.950> a

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
steel I don't think that there is a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.730 
steel I don't think that there is a
crucible<00:03:07.730> equivalent<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:09.290> course<00:03:09.560> a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
crucible equivalent of this of course a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.500 
crucible equivalent of this of course a
little<00:03:10.100> bit<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.280> history<00:03:10.610> here<00:03:10.790> crucible<00:03:11.330> and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.230 
back over the United States for sale
that's<00:04:04.400> part<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.820> reason<00:04:05.090> these<00:04:05.180> things

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
that's part of the reason these things

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.690 
that's part of the reason these things
cost<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:05.870> much<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:06.350> bear<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.590> mind<00:04:06.740> that<00:04:06.860> all

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
cost so much I bear in mind that all

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.210 
cost so much I bear in mind that all
that<00:04:07.970> shipping<00:04:08.270> not<00:04:08.810> logistical<00:04:09.620> stuff<00:04:09.860> it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
that shipping not logistical stuff it

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.640 
that shipping not logistical stuff it
all<00:04:10.430> costs<00:04:11.000> money<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:11.930> kind<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.140> adds<00:04:12.350> to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
all costs money so it kind of adds to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.320 
all costs money so it kind of adds to
the<00:04:12.740> price<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:12.950> these<00:04:13.280> I'm<00:04:13.670> sure<00:04:14.030> they<00:04:14.180> could

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
the price of these I'm sure they could

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.580 
the price of these I'm sure they could
actually<00:04:14.510> probably<00:04:14.780> sell<00:04:15.260> these<00:04:15.410> knives

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
actually probably sell these knives

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.890 
actually probably sell these knives
cheaper<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.100> Taiwan<00:04:16.520> but<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.540> course<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.840> think

really does set this knife off what

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.700 
really does set this knife off what
would<00:05:12.300> basically<00:05:12.569> be<00:05:12.780> kind<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.169> drab<00:05:13.439> knife

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
would basically be kind of a drab knife

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.409 
would basically be kind of a drab knife
and<00:05:14.099> then<00:05:14.310> you<00:05:14.370> add<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.520> blue<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:14.879> it<00:05:15.210> and

and then you add that blue on it and

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.899 
and then you add that blue on it and
it's<00:05:15.509> like<00:05:15.599> a<00:05:15.719> glow<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.650> personally<00:05:17.580> that's

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
it's like a glow so personally that's

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.219 
it's like a glow so personally that's
that's<00:05:18.210> me<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.389> think<00:05:18.599> from<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> design

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
that's me I think from a design

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.309 
that's me I think from a design
standpoint<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.039> think<00:05:20.069> it's<00:05:20.669> really<00:05:20.849> cool<00:05:21.319> now

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
standpoint I think it's really cool now

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.080 
standpoint I think it's really cool now

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
part of that's because marcin Solis is

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.999 
part of that's because marcin Solis is

it's<00:05:42.689> a<00:05:42.840> really<00:05:43.199> cool<00:05:43.379> design<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:44.009> love<00:05:44.250> the

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
it's a really cool design I love the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.890 
it's a really cool design I love the
back<00:05:44.610> spacer<00:05:45.090> in<00:05:45.180> terms<00:05:45.330> of<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.569> grip<00:05:45.779> it

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
back spacer in terms of the grip it

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.719 
back spacer in terms of the grip it
gives<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.199> kind<00:05:46.740> of<00:05:46.860> matches<00:05:47.219> up<00:05:47.340> with<00:05:47.490> the

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
gives you kind of matches up with the

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.700 
gives you kind of matches up with the
jimping<00:05:48.419> I'm<00:05:48.539> sure<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:49.139> spine<00:05:49.379> of<00:05:49.529> the<00:05:49.590> knife

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
jimping I'm sure the spine of the knife

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.260 
jimping I'm sure the spine of the knife
just<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.279> jimping<00:05:50.639> on<00:05:50.699> the<00:05:50.789> spine<00:05:51.029> doesn't

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
just the jimping on the spine doesn't

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.490 
just the jimping on the spine doesn't
give<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.419> a<00:05:51.479> ton<00:05:51.689> of<00:05:51.719> grip<00:05:51.930> because<00:05:52.169> this<00:05:52.319> is<00:05:52.469> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
give you a ton of grip because this is a

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.939 
give you a ton of grip because this is a
stonewash<00:05:53.039> blade<00:05:53.930> but<00:05:54.930> it's<00:05:55.319> pretty<00:05:55.770> good

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
stonewash blade but it's pretty good

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.570 
stonewash blade but it's pretty good
it's<00:05:56.849> not<00:05:57.000> bad<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.919> as<00:05:58.919> far<00:05:59.129> as<00:05:59.189> the<00:05:59.310> handle

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
it's not bad and as far as the handle

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.459 
it's not bad and as far as the handle
feel<00:05:59.789> honestly<00:06:00.539> it's<00:06:00.719> a<00:06:00.810> little<00:06:00.990> small<00:06:01.259> for<00:06:01.289> me

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
feel honestly it's a little small for me

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.890 
feel honestly it's a little small for me
I<00:06:01.710> have<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:01.919> big<00:06:02.190> hand<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.729> for<00:06:03.509> me<00:06:03.629> I<00:06:03.659> think

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
I have a big hand and for me I think

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.439 
I have a big hand and for me I think
it's<00:06:04.289> it's<00:06:04.620> not<00:06:04.800> quite<00:06:05.099> as<00:06:05.430> hand<00:06:06.029> filling<00:06:06.360> as

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
it's it's not quite as hand filling as

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.360 
it's it's not quite as hand filling as
I'd<00:06:06.599> like<00:06:06.870> it<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.169> be<00:06:07.199> but<00:06:08.039> if<00:06:08.159> you<00:06:08.219> had<00:06:08.339> a

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
I'd like it to be but if you had a

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.249 
I'd like it to be but if you had a
smaller<00:06:08.819> hand<00:06:09.180> that<00:06:09.750> this<00:06:09.870> would<00:06:10.050> be<00:06:10.139> actually

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
smaller hand that this would be actually

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.110 
smaller hand that this would be actually
pretty<00:06:10.500> comfortable<00:06:11.039> for<00:06:11.279> you<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.909> does<00:06:12.089> have

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
pretty comfortable for you it does have

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.719 
pretty comfortable for you it does have
a<00:06:12.300> wire<00:06:12.569> pocket<00:06:13.050> clip<00:06:13.259> which<00:06:13.500> is<00:06:13.550> left<00:06:14.550> or

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
a wire pocket clip which is left or

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.140 
a wire pocket clip which is left or
right<00:06:14.909> side<00:06:15.180> and<00:06:15.479> carry<00:06:15.830> which<00:06:16.830> I<00:06:16.949> like<00:06:17.190> the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
right side and carry which I like the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.670 
right side and carry which I like the
wire<00:06:18.330> pocket<00:06:18.779> clips<00:06:19.020> are<00:06:19.199> some<00:06:19.349> of<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.500> best

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
wire pocket clips are some of the best

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.110 
wire pocket clips are some of the best
ones<00:06:19.830> out<00:06:20.009> there<00:06:20.190> honestly<00:06:20.699> I<00:06:20.729> think<00:06:20.819> it's<00:06:21.000> a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
ones out there honestly I think it's a

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.760 
ones out there honestly I think it's a
genius<00:06:21.270> on<00:06:21.629> the<00:06:21.659> spider<00:06:21.900> Coast<00:06:22.110> part<00:06:22.379> super

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
genius on the spider Coast part super

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.519 
genius on the spider Coast part super
cheap<00:06:22.979> to<00:06:23.159> make<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:24.199> honestly<00:06:25.199> I<00:06:25.229> think<00:06:25.349> it

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 
cheap to make and honestly I think it

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.469 
cheap to make and honestly I think it
accomplishes<00:06:26.129> the<00:06:26.370> job<00:06:26.580> of<00:06:26.819> a<00:06:26.909> pocket<00:06:27.300> clip

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 
accomplishes the job of a pocket clip

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.159 
accomplishes the job of a pocket clip
extremely<00:06:28.050> well<00:06:28.969> now<00:06:29.969> will<00:06:30.300> bear<00:06:30.810> mind<00:06:31.020> of

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
extremely well now will bear mind of

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.300 
extremely well now will bear mind of
course<00:06:31.379> that<00:06:31.560> this<00:06:31.710> is<00:06:31.770> an<00:06:32.009> entirely

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
course that this is an entirely

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.519 
course that this is an entirely
stonewash<00:06:32.849> knife<00:06:33.120> it<00:06:34.020> should<00:06:34.199> be<00:06:34.289> fairly

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
stonewash knife it should be fairly

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.200 
stonewash knife it should be fairly
scratch<00:06:35.159> resistant<00:06:35.729> I<00:06:35.819> think<00:06:35.969> it's<00:06:36.089> gonna

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
scratch resistant I think it's gonna

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.279 
scratch resistant I think it's gonna
wear<00:06:36.509> really<00:06:36.779> well

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
wear really well

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:39.589 
wear really well
and<00:06:37.409> it's<00:06:37.830> gonna<00:06:37.919> age<00:06:38.219> really<00:06:38.580> well<00:06:38.759> so<00:06:39.539> I

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
and it's gonna age really well so I

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:40.730 
and it's gonna age really well so I
think<00:06:39.689> that<00:06:39.930> this<00:06:40.080> is<00:06:40.229> going<00:06:40.349> to<00:06:40.409> be<00:06:40.529> a<00:06:40.560> knife

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
think that this is going to be a knife

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.499 
think that this is going to be a knife
that's<00:06:40.949> gonna<00:06:41.099> be<00:06:41.279> really<00:06:41.639> good<00:06:41.879> in<00:06:42.060> pocket

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
that's gonna be really good in pocket

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.679 
that's gonna be really good in pocket
carry<00:06:43.520> although<00:06:44.520> generally<00:06:45.000> for<00:06:45.270> me<00:06:45.389> I<00:06:45.419> like<00:06:45.659> a

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
carry although generally for me I like a

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:47.209 
carry although generally for me I like a
bigger<00:06:45.960> knife<00:06:46.199> for<00:06:46.469> this<00:06:46.589> weight<00:06:46.860> it<00:06:47.099> is<00:06:47.189> a

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
bigger knife for this weight it is a

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.159 
bigger knife for this weight it is a
fairly<00:06:47.490> chunky<00:06:47.759> knife<00:06:48.180> and<00:06:48.479> that's<00:06:48.629> only<00:06:48.900> real

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
fairly chunky knife and that's only real

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.749 
fairly chunky knife and that's only real
downside<00:06:49.379> of<00:06:49.830> this<00:06:49.889> knife<00:06:50.099> in<00:06:50.279> my<00:06:50.400> opinion

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
downside of this knife in my opinion

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.019 
downside of this knife in my opinion
down<00:06:51.240> the<00:06:51.449> cost<00:06:51.689> they're<00:06:52.319> fairly<00:06:52.620> high<00:06:53.029> both

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:54.029 
down the cost they're fairly high both

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:56.929 
down the cost they're fairly high both
both<00:06:54.779> statistics<00:06:55.439> there<00:06:55.680> but<00:06:56.580> if<00:06:56.669> you<00:06:56.729> can<00:06:56.819> get

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
both statistics there but if you can get

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.100 
both statistics there but if you can get
over<00:06:57.029> the<00:06:57.150> cost<00:06:57.449> if<00:06:57.659> you<00:06:57.689> can<00:06:57.839> get<00:06:57.930> over<00:06:58.020> the

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
over the cost if you can get over the

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.510 
over the cost if you can get over the
weight<00:06:58.319> I<00:06:58.529> think<00:06:58.740> this<00:06:58.860> is<00:06:59.099> a<00:06:59.129> really<00:06:59.339> good

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
weight I think this is a really good

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.310 
weight I think this is a really good
little<00:06:59.759> knife

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
little knife

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.700 
little knife
and<00:07:00.440> if<00:07:01.190> you<00:07:01.460> like<00:07:02.180> the<00:07:02.510> premium<00:07:02.960> Steel's<00:07:03.470> you

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
and if you like the premium Steel's you

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.170 
and if you like the premium Steel's you
don't<00:07:03.890> mind<00:07:04.070> it<00:07:04.190> being<00:07:04.310> produced<00:07:04.580> in<00:07:04.790> Taiwan

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
don't mind it being produced in Taiwan

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.600 
don't mind it being produced in Taiwan
and<00:07:06.050> of<00:07:06.350> course<00:07:06.560> you<00:07:06.710> were<00:07:06.830> maybe<00:07:07.130> a<00:07:07.220> fan<00:07:07.490> of

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
and of course you were maybe a fan of

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.460 
and of course you were maybe a fan of
marcin<00:07:07.970> this<00:07:08.930> would<00:07:09.080> be<00:07:09.140> a<00:07:09.170> really<00:07:09.380> really

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
marcin this would be a really really

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.440 
marcin this would be a really really
good<00:07:09.650> knife<00:07:09.920> for<00:07:10.160> you<00:07:10.190> I<00:07:10.490> think<00:07:10.940> as<00:07:11.120> a<00:07:11.180> win<00:07:11.330> for

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450
