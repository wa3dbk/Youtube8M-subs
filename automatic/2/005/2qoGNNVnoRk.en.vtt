00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
in call of duty ghosts is it's kind of

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.500 
in call of duty ghosts is it's kind of
the<00:03:39.350> same<00:03:39.560> as<00:03:39.769> modern<00:03:40.130> warfare<00:03:40.310> 3<00:03:40.580> when<00:03:41.420> in

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the same as modern warfare 3 when in

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.820 
the same as modern warfare 3 when in
modern<00:03:41.720> warfare<00:03:41.750> 3<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.380> could<00:03:42.530> flip<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
modern warfare 3 you could flip the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.620 
modern warfare 3 you could flip the
spawns<00:03:43.070> by<00:03:43.340> yourself<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.150> pushed<00:03:44.420> into

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
spawns by yourself if you pushed into

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.539 
spawns by yourself if you pushed into
that<00:03:44.930> really<00:03:45.380> bad<00:03:45.620> spot<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.220> shouldn't

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
that really bad spot that you shouldn't

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.820 
that really bad spot that you shouldn't
have<00:03:46.670> gone<00:03:46.820> or<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.630> one<00:03:47.930> other<00:03:48.080> person<00:03:48.290> pushes

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
have gone or if one other person pushes

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.870 
have gone or if one other person pushes
and<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.040> can<00:03:49.190> flip<00:03:49.400> them<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.760> could

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
and you can flip them but you could

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.670 
and you can flip them but you could
always<00:03:50.090> judge<00:03:50.480> how<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.750> spawn<00:03:51.110> was<00:03:51.320> going<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
always judge how the spawn was going to

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.740 
always judge how the spawn was going to
work<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.519> works<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.880> same<00:03:52.910> when<00:03:53.360> it<00:03:53.450> comes<00:03:53.600> to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
work it works the same when it comes to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.539 
work it works the same when it comes to
call<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.049> duty<00:03:54.290> ghosts<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.980> spawns<00:03:55.340> are

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
call of duty ghosts the spawns are

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.370 
call of duty ghosts the spawns are
really<00:03:56.120> really<00:03:56.420> difficult<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.989> flip<00:03:57.200> by

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
really really difficult to flip by

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.350 
really really difficult to flip by
yourself<00:03:57.799> with<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.430> few<00:03:58.640> teammates<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.209> is

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
yourself with a few teammates it is

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.020 
yourself with a few teammates it is
pretty<00:03:59.570> easy<00:03:59.840> that<00:04:00.470> opens<00:04:00.769> up<00:04:00.890> a<00:04:01.040> new<00:04:01.070> play

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
pretty easy that opens up a new play

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.030 
pretty easy that opens up a new play
style<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.510> opens<00:04:02.810> up<00:04:02.900> different<00:04:03.320> ways<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.530> play

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
style it opens up different ways to play

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.770 
style it opens up different ways to play
the<00:04:04.730> map<00:04:05.030> now<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.390> might<00:04:05.600> be<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> little

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the map now you might be a little

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.090 
the map now you might be a little
confused<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.590> what<00:04:06.739> I'm<00:04:06.830> trying<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.040> say

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
is when you play a map you're not just

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.590 
is when you play a map you're not just
playing<00:04:09.230> one<00:04:09.920> map<00:04:10.190> you're<00:04:10.580> playing<00:04:10.880> three

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
playing one map you're playing three

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.170 
playing one map you're playing three
maps<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.290> might<00:04:12.470> be<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.799> dude<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.640> one<00:04:13.940> map

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
maps you might be like dude it's one map

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.580 
maps you might be like dude it's one map
you<00:04:14.570> got<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.810> understand<00:04:15.200> there's<00:04:15.350> three

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
you got to understand there's three

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.920 
you got to understand there's three
different<00:04:15.830> spawn<00:04:16.310> systems<00:04:16.790> on<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:16.970> map<00:04:17.419> there's

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
different spawn systems on a map there's

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.319 
different spawn systems on a map there's
always<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> flag<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.220> B<00:04:19.400> flag<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> sea

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
always the a flag the B flag and the sea

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.580 
always the a flag the B flag and the sea
flag<00:04:20.660> now<00:04:20.840> it's<00:04:21.019> always<00:04:21.200> going<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.530> be

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
flag now it's always going to be

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.020 
flag now it's always going to be
interesting<00:04:22.070> because<00:04:22.160> they're<00:04:22.430> always<00:04:22.669> going

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
interesting because they're always going

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.850 
interesting because they're always going
to<00:04:23.180> have<00:04:23.210> different<00:04:23.600> place<00:04:24.050> up<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.590> I'm<00:04:24.680> going

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
to have different place up so I'm going

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.260 
to have different place up so I'm going
to<00:04:24.890> be<00:04:24.979> faster<00:04:25.340> than<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.520> others<00:04:25.790> some<00:04:26.240> are

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
to be faster than the others some are

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.700 
to be faster than the others some are
gonna<00:04:26.419> be<00:04:26.540> slower<00:04:26.840> than<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.050> others<00:04:27.380> some

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
gonna be slower than the others some

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.890 
gonna be slower than the others some
will<00:04:27.800> be<00:04:27.830> safer<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.520> whatnot<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:29.690> when<00:04:29.810> it

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
will be safer and whatnot but when it

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.969 
will be safer and whatnot but when it
comes<00:04:30.020> down<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.229> a<00:04:30.350> map<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.650> can<00:04:30.770> play<00:04:30.950> it

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
comes down to a map you can play it

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.500 
comes down to a map you can play it
three<00:04:31.430> different<00:04:31.580> ways<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.970> can<00:04:32.210> play<00:04:32.479> it

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
three different ways you can play it

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.839 
three different ways you can play it
either<00:04:32.690> at<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.349> B<00:04:33.380> or<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.979> C<00:04:34.280> flag<00:04:34.640> and

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
either at the a the B or the C flag and

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.519 
either at the a the B or the C flag and
that<00:04:35.240> essentially<00:04:35.780> cuts<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.320> map<00:04:36.500> in<00:04:36.680> true

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:37.529 
that essentially cuts the map in true

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.139 
that essentially cuts the map in true
third<00:04:37.829> you're<00:04:38.399> going<00:04:38.639> from<00:04:38.819> playing<00:04:39.059> the

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:39.149 
third you're going from playing the

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.239 
third you're going from playing the
biggest<00:04:39.539> mouth<00:04:39.689> into<00:04:39.899> the<00:04:39.989> game<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.739> play<00:04:40.979> in<00:04:41.099> a

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:41.249 
biggest mouth into the game to play in a

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.969 
biggest mouth into the game to play in a
map<00:04:41.459> half<00:04:42.029> the<00:04:42.269> size<00:04:42.539> even<00:04:42.899> under<00:04:43.559> half<00:04:43.769> the

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
map half the size even under half the

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.199 
map half the size even under half the
size<00:04:44.189> and<00:04:44.369> you're<00:04:44.489> not<00:04:44.609> even<00:04:44.789> playing<00:04:45.119> the

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:45.209 
size and you're not even playing the

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:46.909 
size and you're not even playing the
full<00:04:45.359> sized<00:04:45.629> mouth<00:04:45.839> anymore<00:04:46.109> and<00:04:46.409> as<00:04:46.769> I<00:04:46.859> said

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
full sized mouth anymore and as I said

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.259 
full sized mouth anymore and as I said
it's<00:04:47.159> really<00:04:47.459> difficult<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:47.909> flip<00:04:48.119> them

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:48.269 
it's really difficult to flip them

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:49.879 
it's really difficult to flip them
unless<00:04:48.449> your<00:04:48.629> team<00:04:48.839> starts<00:04:49.169> Rambo<00:04:49.529> in<00:04:49.649> and

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
unless your team starts Rambo in and

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.859 
unless your team starts Rambo in and
starts<00:04:50.099> pushing<00:04:50.459> in<00:04:50.609> so<00:04:51.449> when<00:04:51.569> you<00:04:51.659> think

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:51.869 
starts pushing in so when you think

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.139 
starts pushing in so when you think
about<00:04:51.929> it<00:04:52.109> so<00:04:52.679> Navin<00:04:53.009> really<00:04:53.459> isn't<00:04:53.789> that<00:04:53.849> big

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:54.149 
about it so Navin really isn't that big

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:56.599 
about it so Navin really isn't that big
it<00:04:54.419> can<00:04:54.659> be<00:04:54.749> really<00:04:55.049> really<00:04:55.679> fast<00:04:56.069> paced<00:04:56.399> it

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:56.609 
it can be really really fast paced it

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:58.339 
it can be really really fast paced it
can<00:04:56.699> be<00:04:56.759> really<00:04:56.999> fun<00:04:57.239> to<00:04:57.269> play<00:04:57.569> and<00:04:57.839> it<00:04:58.169> can<00:04:58.259> be

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
can be really fun to play and it can be

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.599 
can be really fun to play and it can be
one<00:04:58.469> of<00:04:58.529> the<00:04:58.589> best<00:04:58.739> maps<00:04:58.979> in<00:04:59.129> the<00:04:59.159> game<00:04:59.369> in<00:04:59.519> my

00:04:59.599 --> 00:04:59.609 
one of the best maps in the game in my

00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:01.639 
one of the best maps in the game in my
opinion<00:04:59.869> depending<00:05:00.869> on<00:05:00.989> where<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.349> want<00:05:01.379> to

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:19.829 
map only big or does it only feel big

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:22.009 
map only big or does it only feel big
because<00:05:20.249> of<00:05:20.399> the<00:05:20.459> way<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.699> play<00:05:21.119> the<00:05:21.149> map<00:05:21.539> or

in my personal opinion you can change

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.159 
in my personal opinion you can change
how<00:05:26.219> that<00:05:26.459> plays<00:05:26.729> by<00:05:27.209> where<00:05:27.479> you<00:05:27.659> play<00:05:27.899> it<00:05:28.049> at

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
how that plays by where you play it at

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.519 
how that plays by where you play it at
and<00:05:28.319> what<00:05:28.499> spawns<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:29.219> choose<00:05:29.459> to<00:05:29.639> dictate<00:05:30.089> I

and what spawns you choose to dictate I
personally<00:05:31.529> on<00:05:31.709> stone<00:05:31.979> haven't<00:05:32.339> like<00:05:32.519> to

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
personally on stone haven't like to

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.629 
personally on stone haven't like to
choose<00:05:32.849> B<00:05:33.179> but<00:05:33.749> when<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.259> comes<00:05:34.409> to<00:05:34.499> a<00:05:34.529> and<00:05:34.799> C<00:05:34.979> C

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
choose B but when it comes to a and C C

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.999 
choose B but when it comes to a and C C
can<00:05:35.969> be<00:05:35.999> extremely<00:05:36.599> fast-paced<00:05:37.049> that's

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
can be extremely fast-paced that's

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.199 
can be extremely fast-paced that's
something<00:05:38.219> I<00:05:38.279> want<00:05:38.429> you<00:05:38.489> guys<00:05:38.609> to<00:05:38.789> think<00:05:38.819> about
