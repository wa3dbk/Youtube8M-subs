00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.279
 Hello and welcome to a new video for Battlefield Bad Company 2 the 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.229
 Politics Sound as most effective none 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.359
 Could crack tanks 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.009
 OMV for this video we have managed the explosive break 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.830
 making the three chains stronger for the cygnet is in the end of use 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:22.779
 not easy 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.179
 At the end of this video, we'll show you all there with a single one 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.140
 is also the big terrains could destroy, nothing needs further 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.350
 that most players do 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.090
 then if other kids and one shoots then always hit 90-degree angles then 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.540
 you have the biggest damage the moment yours Erwin KÃ¼hnel only 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900
 still undercuts the pen-club percent 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.150
 the damage amounts to approx 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.680
 Insider reports 4 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.080
 90 bases are clearly behind and the prices range from the front 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.940
 still very little 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.220
 around 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 in numbers more from behind the 70 goals fell 70 percent looked 5 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.900
 Percent the pirates will make her from 4 to 02 percent 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.040
 when her side shoots out that I'm at Mercedes by far 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.970
 Exceeded then fits already draw strength on the fifth start and left 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.860
 still weird tv-appearance then there is still round Sasic 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.230
 we take Klingenthal on a tank then shoot 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 how actually the stand was about halved 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210
 Fung go 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 then we need to be further distributed by many 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080
 Advertising face and used 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.210
 Both are exactly the same chances 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.950
 to the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.870
 rather, large fleet level can be obtained for one 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.210
 Percent used against tanks it will definitely be extra early soft targets 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 considered 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.430
 Powerman if you run impressively that I will be the same 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.550
 Damage seen it was a weak make no sense 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.140
 Allegedly you can hear trends in which you get right to the point between 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.930
 Brody and Peru 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.600
 without Cuche I have not made it regularly 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.810
 producing Stadler to the producers again, they are even 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.880
 not only 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.239
 have from time to time to work as I said that I can 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.389
 It does not really follow that always works 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.389
 therefore 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.469
 the contents listed 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.139
 so in the video you can actually see that pretty well a trend is going 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.519
 Obama will go straight from 4,000 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.219
 a lot of valve that is from before the winter hits it 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.179
 To destroy Jochen Schilling 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.329
 that means used in Winnenden 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.930
 and develop a tank of proposals do not stand in the room to stand still 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.269
 always light especially the percent 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.309
 Grenades hit from the outset in the ranking right angle hit 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.759
 then we would have a whole lot more off 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.769
 as promised 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.469
 at the moment are fleeing 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.289
 Carsten can destroy 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:57.309
 here we are not directly affected a bit of zest for life Daniela 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:02.289
 Katzenberger a total of four packages also go 90 was the corner for the 2 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.469
 interfere with violent protests 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.810
 the first half does not lose the 4 therefore needs Obama 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.349
 St 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.790
 MZ 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.300
