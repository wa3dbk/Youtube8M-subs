00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.850
 the question will be about the arnold classic 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.829
 after all, he passed two weeks ago 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.900
 how did your form change from that 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.579
 moment and now we have heard the edge 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.190
 the fact that the next tournament will be through 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.739
 six weeks europe 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 orlando and actually this is the tournament on 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.399
 which won my first pro win 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.990
 justin compton last year uniform 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:17.770
 which to me at the moment and pleased 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.009
 tournament which was held in Columbus 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.830
 the more goals and objectives which 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.740
 appears before me now after six 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.399
 weeks to a tournament in the tournament orlando euro 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.409
 went it working off some of the nuances 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.579
 which i 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:42.079
 after watching the video and photos after 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.869
 video made for myself and decided 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.030
 work in this direction therefore 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.369
 Now quite a long period of time 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.789
 which will allow me to achieve their 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.569
 goals 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.640
 so stay well and then again 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.140
 This we have such an express interview what 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.780
 of athletes may be from precisely when 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.670
 Live communication produced the most such you 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.740
 I am really impressed 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.899
 all athletes are very strong and have produced 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.000
 very strong impression there for 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:15.379
 backstage was very healthy competition 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.599
 and everything was pretty dignified enough 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:25.280
 level passed what each of them left 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:28.730
 such a good impression here 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.069
 each of them can navigate 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.650
 each of them can find his idol 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.030
 if you are bodybuilding because 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.609
 not for nothing this is probably the best half 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.310
 bodybuilders all over the world who are here 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.019

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.769
 Columbus 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.069
 Well, then in the end can be 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.469
 a few words of thanks to their sponsors 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.500

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.720
 I will try twice so that 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.489
 for people who play big 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.620
