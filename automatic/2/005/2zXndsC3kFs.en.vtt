too bad about it okay chef what's

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
too bad about it okay chef what's
sticking<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.180> beer<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
sticking out to you here in this beer I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
sticking out to you here in this beer I
think<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.530> drink<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.250> more

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
think as I drink it a little bit more

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
think as I drink it a little bit more
it's<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.180> fruitiness<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.079> can

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it's that that fruitiness so you can

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.200 
it's that that fruitiness so you can
smell<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> fruit<00:02:02.070> aspect<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> then

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
smell the fruit aspect to it and then

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
smell the fruit aspect to it and then
you<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> citrus<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> towards<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> back

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you get that citrus and towards the back

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
you get that citrus and towards the back
of<00:02:05.310> my<00:02:05.520> throat<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> citrus

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
of my throat I can get that citrus

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
of my throat I can get that citrus
flavor<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.200> along<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.770> caramel<00:02:08.129> in

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
flavor to it along with the caramel in

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.840 
flavor to it along with the caramel in
and<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.910> hoppiness<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
and the hoppiness I think this is it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.720 
and the hoppiness I think this is it
a<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.750> drinkable<00:02:13.260> beer<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
could sit around you probably get wasted

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.920 
could sit around you probably get wasted
with<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.820> six<00:02:18.090> percent<00:02:18.420> abv

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
with it because of the six percent abv

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
with it because of the six percent abv
but<00:02:19.200> yeah<00:02:19.590> sneak<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.610> yellow<00:02:20.940> yeah<00:02:21.120> you

but yeah sneak up on yellow yeah you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.730 
but yeah sneak up on yellow yeah you

could sit around and drink quite a few
of<00:02:22.770> these<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:24.150> does<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.630> does<00:02:24.840> leave<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
what would you have this beer with like

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.450 
what would you have this beer with like
what<00:02:33.810> kind<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.080> food<00:02:34.350> do<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.710> see<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.220> with

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
what kind of food do you see this with

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.980 
what kind of food do you see this with
partington<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.420> i<00:02:36.510> thought<00:02:36.660> it'd<00:02:36.810> go<00:02:36.960> well

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
partington really i thought it'd go well

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.050 
partington really i thought it'd go well
with<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> steak<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> think<00:02:38.100> maybe<00:02:38.340> even<00:02:38.580> pasta

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
with the steak I think maybe even pasta

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.160 
with the steak I think maybe even pasta
just<00:02:39.270> something<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.600> has<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.720> little<00:02:39.840> bit

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
just something that has a little bit

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.230 
just something that has a little bit
about<00:02:40.430> maybe<00:02:41.430> moisture<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.030> as<00:02:42.210> well

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
about maybe moisture to it as well

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.730 
about maybe moisture to it as well
because<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.840> kind<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.080> takes<00:02:43.290> away<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.530> little

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
because this kind of takes away a little

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.280 
because this kind of takes away a little
bit<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.730> overall<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> spear<00:02:45.750> itself<00:02:46.080> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
bit but and overall the spear itself I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.750 
bit but and overall the spear itself I
mean<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.890> probably<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:47.550> anything

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
mean you probably have it with anything

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.190 
mean you probably have it with anything
I<00:02:47.970> really<00:02:48.330> like<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> i<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.080> good

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
I really like it i think it's a good

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.980 
I really like it i think it's a good
beer<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.560> i'm<00:02:49.650> probably<00:02:50.210> turned<00:02:51.210> get<00:02:51.360> mo<00:02:51.810> any

in like when when's a good time of year
or<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> good<00:03:07.710> event<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.280> drink<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:08.640> at<00:03:08.850> i<00:03:09.120> think

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
or a good event to drink this at i think

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
or a good event to drink this at i think
that<00:03:10.020> with<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.560> taste<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> beer<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
that with the taste of the beer it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490 
that with the taste of the beer it
almost<00:03:11.670> comes<00:03:12.000> off<00:03:12.210> as<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> fall<00:03:12.720> beer<00:03:13.020> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
almost comes off as a fall beer it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.990 
almost comes off as a fall beer it
doesn't<00:03:13.770> really<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.070> spicy<00:03:14.430> notes<00:03:14.790> as

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
doesn't really have the spicy notes as

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.080 
doesn't really have the spicy notes as
most<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.870> beers<00:03:16.170> would<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:17.670> just

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
most of all beers would have but just

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.510 
most of all beers would have but just
the<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.170> know<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> maple<00:03:19.920> flavor<00:03:20.220> and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
the you know like the maple flavor and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.190 
the you know like the maple flavor and
it<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.820> really<00:03:21.090> kind<00:03:21.240> of<00:03:21.390> reminds<00:03:21.780> me<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.960> a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
it just really kind of reminds me of a

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.410 
it just really kind of reminds me of a
cooler<00:03:22.680> part<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> year<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.490> wouldn't<00:03:24.330> go<00:03:24.390> so
