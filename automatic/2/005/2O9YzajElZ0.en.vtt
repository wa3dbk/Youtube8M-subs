00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.070
 a kilo of corn 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.300
 and three tablespoons of lime 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.670
 let's put a pot with two liters of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.560
 water let's put the head and we're going 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.560
 to put three tablespoons of lime 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.879
 let's wait for it to boil and when 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.879
 start to boil let's be the corn 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.120
 when the water is about to boil 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 let's throw the corn 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.290
 is going to stir a bit we are going to cover 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.840
 the pot and we're going to leave it for 15 minutes 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.540
 after 15 minutes we will go down 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the fire and let's rest all 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 the night 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.580
 the system already got wet all night and 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.930
 the next day what are we going to do what 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.930
 let's go to another tray 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.960
 I'm seeing faces 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.430
 we like it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 Now I'm going to put some water 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 clean 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.810
 and we're going to give him a rinsed label 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.049
 nothing else this there is no need for that 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.789
 it is very well clean this and so we go 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.700
 to draw the water we will let it 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.590
 drain and we will save it when 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 let's go make the tortillas or 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.579
 let's go to the pozole or the food 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.810
 what are we going to do then we are going to 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.840
 wash it perfectly remove the water and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 I put it in a colander to parade 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.390
 I'm going to leave an excess of water 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.760
 moment and then we're going to put it in some 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.830
 sachets for storage 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.799
 now I'm going to take out the is wrong and I'm going to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.720
 put in a little pot of yogurt of those 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:30.750
 that are one kilo to save it in a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.400
 bag and so we already know that the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 sachets are pockets of kilo 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 and they are going to leave two bags did not go out with 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.750
 One kilo of corn is raw when cooked. 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.750
 they make 12 kilos of nixtamal 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.480
