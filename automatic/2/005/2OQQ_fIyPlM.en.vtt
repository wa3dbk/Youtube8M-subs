you know what they're doing what are
yous<00:00:29.140> doing<00:00:29.519> scientists<00:00:30.519> bring<00:00:31.119> in<00:00:31.239> the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
yous doing scientists bring in the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.389 
yous doing scientists bring in the
mammoth<00:00:31.480> back<00:00:31.810> oh<00:00:32.050> yeah<00:00:32.470> they're<00:00:32.739> genetically

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
mammoth back oh yeah they're genetically

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.369 
mammoth back oh yeah they're genetically
engineering<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.030> there<00:00:34.540> are<00:00:34.660> few<00:00:35.050> sort<00:00:35.320> of

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
engineering it there are few sort of

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.049 
engineering it there are few sort of
million<00:00:35.920> bits<00:00:36.100> and<00:00:36.280> pieces<00:00:36.550> away<00:00:36.640> but<00:00:36.970> they

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
million bits and pieces away but they

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.130 
million bits and pieces away but they
reckon<00:00:37.329> they're<00:00:37.480> going<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.660> be<00:00:37.720> able<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.960> build

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
reckon they're going to be able to build

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.950 
reckon they're going to be able to build
a<00:00:38.800> living<00:00:39.280> mammoth<00:00:39.730> within<00:00:40.030> two<00:00:40.510> years<00:00:40.690> here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
a living mammoth within two years here

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.990 
a living mammoth within two years here
really<00:00:41.320> yeah<00:00:41.769> what's<00:00:42.280> your<00:00:42.400> Jurassic<00:00:42.699> Park

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
really yeah what's your Jurassic Park

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.350 
really yeah what's your Jurassic Park
sort<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.720> yeah<00:00:43.930> um<00:00:44.500> yeah<00:00:45.460> what<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.150> car

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
sort of yeah um yeah what is it that car

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.509 
sort of yeah um yeah what is it that car
oh<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:48.879> need<00:00:49.089> them<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:50.559> weak<00:00:50.739> well<00:00:51.309> that<00:00:51.399> is

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
oh do I need them was weak well that is

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.030 
oh do I need them was weak well that is
it<00:00:51.640> worth<00:00:51.820> messing<00:00:52.809> about<00:00:53.019> cuz<00:00:53.500> i<00:00:53.589> always

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
it worth messing about cuz i always

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.610 
it worth messing about cuz i always
think<00:00:54.339> 'what<00:00:54.840> whoever's<00:00:55.840> like<00:00:56.170> knocking<00:00:56.440> one

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
think 'what whoever's like knocking one

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.200 
think 'what whoever's like knocking one
of<00:00:56.710> these<00:00:56.800> together<00:00:56.980> right<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.940> must<00:00:58.090> be

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
of these together right it must be

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.990 
of these together right it must be
pretty<00:00:58.300> bright<00:00:58.629> yeah<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.129> whilst<00:01:00.640> they're

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
pretty bright yeah so whilst they're

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.819 
pretty bright yeah so whilst they're
messing<00:01:01.570> about<00:01:01.719> with<00:01:01.780> an<00:01:01.960> airy<00:01:02.140> elephant<00:01:02.559> is

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
messing about with an airy elephant is

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.990 
messing about with an airy elephant is
it<00:01:03.489> could<00:01:04.030> they<00:01:04.210> be<00:01:04.269> doing<00:01:04.750> more<00:01:05.789> useful<00:01:06.789> stuff

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
it could they be doing more useful stuff

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.669 
it could they be doing more useful stuff
that<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.300> world<00:01:07.479> needs<00:01:07.720> well<00:01:08.320> it's<00:01:08.470> sort<00:01:08.619> of

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
that the world needs well it's sort of

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.830 
that the world needs well it's sort of
like<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.759> know<00:01:09.910> it's<00:01:10.090> it's<00:01:10.270> fascinating

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
like it you know it's it's fascinating

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 
like it you know it's it's fascinating
even<00:01:11.440> if<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:11.649> on<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.160> face<00:01:12.310> of<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.670> looks

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
even if it on the face of it it looks

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.730 
even if it on the face of it it looks
pointless<00:01:13.270> which<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.539> rarely<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:13.990> scientific

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
pointless which it rarely is scientific

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.279 
pointless which it rarely is scientific
discovery<00:01:15.160> it's<00:01:15.700> about<00:01:15.940> conquering<00:01:16.780> nature

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289

discovery it's about conquering nature
isn't<00:01:17.440> it<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:17.619> mean<00:01:17.710> that's<00:01:17.860> amazing<00:01:18.460> isn't<00:01:18.550> it

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
isn't it I mean that's amazing isn't it

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.520 
isn't it I mean that's amazing isn't it
that<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:18.880> could<00:01:19.030> bring<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.479> mammoth<00:01:20.200> fat<00:01:20.350> what

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
that you could bring a mammoth fat what

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.660 
that you could bring a mammoth fat what
are<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.679> implications<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.280> bring<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.610> a

are the implications to bring in a
mammoth<00:01:21.940> back<00:01:22.149> you<00:01:22.570> know<00:01:22.720> could<00:01:23.229> they<00:01:23.409> feed

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
mammoth back you know could they feed

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.880 
mammoth back you know could they feed

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
it for the culture show because I do a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.840 
it for the culture show because I do a
podcast<00:02:37.700> hour<00:02:38.210> which<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.320> like<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.980> radio<00:02:40.550> show

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
for the computer and I just thought it'd

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.950 
for the computer and I just thought it'd
be<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.340> bit<00:02:43.490> boring<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.240> played<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> clip<00:02:44.690> from

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
be a bit boring if we played a clip from

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.630 
be a bit boring if we played a clip from
it<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.410> me<00:02:45.500> mate<00:02:45.650> Laurie<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.250> sort<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.550> do

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it so I got me mate Laurie to sort of do

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.990 
it so I got me mate Laurie to sort of do
a<00:02:46.670> little<00:02:46.880> cartoon<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.080> your<00:02:48.980> boss<00:02:49.250> they<00:02:49.700> came
