00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
with it when I first played the game and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.419

run<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:31.839> pretty<00:00:32.020> much<00:00:32.140> did<00:00:32.410> these<00:00:32.560> first<00:00:32.950> time

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
run I pretty much did these first time

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.740 
run I pretty much did these first time
some<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.880> them<00:00:33.970> took<00:00:34.120> maybe<00:00:34.330> wanted<00:00:34.660> two

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
some of them took maybe wanted two

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.780 
some of them took maybe wanted two
attempts<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.620> handful<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.280> them<00:00:36.490> were<00:00:36.670> all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
attempts but a handful of them were all

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.290 
attempts but a handful of them were all
done<00:00:37.030> 11<00:00:37.600> tag<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.230> I<00:00:38.790> did<00:00:39.790> not<00:00:39.940> think<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.180> would

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
done 11 tag and I did not think it would

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.660 
done 11 tag and I did not think it would
work<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.690> way<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:42.160> I've<00:00:42.370> got<00:00:42.490> to<00:00:42.580> tell

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
work that way because I've got to tell

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.030 
work that way because I've got to tell
you<00:00:42.730> guys<00:00:42.940> my<00:00:43.810> first<00:00:44.320> playthrough<00:00:44.590> of<00:00:44.830> this

you guys my first playthrough of this

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.550 
you guys my first playthrough of this
game<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:46.390> in<00:00:46.450> preparation<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:47.050> making<00:00:47.470> a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
game for in preparation to making a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.850 
game for in preparation to making a
guide<00:00:47.740> was<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.370> hardest<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.180> longest

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
guide was the hardest and longest

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.460 
guide was the hardest and longest
playthrough<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:51.010> any<00:00:51.700> guide<00:00:52.210> I've<00:00:52.420> made<00:00:52.660> it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
playthrough of any guide I've made it

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.160 
playthrough of any guide I've made it
took<00:00:53.680> me<00:00:53.860> longer<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:55.150> was<00:00:55.390> more<00:00:55.570> frustrating

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
took me longer it was more frustrating

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.600 
took me longer it was more frustrating
it<00:00:56.290> was<00:00:56.320> more<00:00:56.560> difficult<00:00:56.710> than<00:00:57.130> any

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
it was more difficult than any

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.660 
it was more difficult than any
walkthrough<00:00:58.300> on<00:00:58.480> my<00:00:59.020> channel<00:00:59.380> and<00:00:59.530> that<00:01:00.460> is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
walkthrough on my channel and that is

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.600 
walkthrough on my channel and that is
insane<00:01:01.300> because<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.440> like<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.220> think<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:03.550> myself

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
insane because I like to think of myself

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.910 
insane because I like to think of myself
as<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.089> pretty<00:01:04.210> decent<00:01:04.659> hitman<00:01:04.869> player<00:01:05.110> but<00:01:05.830> it

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
as a pretty decent hitman player but it

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.170 
as a pretty decent hitman player but it
just<00:01:06.070> goes<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.280> show<00:01:06.369> how<00:01:06.670> different<00:01:07.090> this

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
just goes to show how different this

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.260 
just goes to show how different this
game<00:01:07.390> works<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.759> that's<00:01:09.759> not<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> bad<00:01:10.240> thing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
game works and that's not a bad thing

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.540 
game works and that's not a bad thing
that<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:10.750> took<00:01:10.900> me<00:01:11.050> longer<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.860> just<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.310> big

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
that it took me longer it's just a big

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.580 
that it took me longer it's just a big
surprise<00:01:12.790> because<00:01:13.300> I<00:01:13.570> was<00:01:13.720> expecting<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.320> have

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
surprise because I was expecting to have

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.590 
surprise because I was expecting to have
to<00:01:14.770> study<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.190> missions<00:01:15.550> I<00:01:15.730> wasn't<00:01:16.210> expecting

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
to study the missions I wasn't expecting

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.380 
to study the missions I wasn't expecting
to<00:01:16.960> have<00:01:17.230> to<00:01:17.440> almost<00:01:17.830> game<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.670> mechanics<00:01:19.150> as

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
to have to almost game the mechanics as

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.560 
to have to almost game the mechanics as
much<00:01:19.600> as<00:01:19.780> I<00:01:19.870> do<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.260> this<00:01:20.530> on<00:01:20.860> this<00:01:20.890> game<00:01:21.190> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
much as I do on this on this game and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.450 
much as I do on this on this game and
that<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:22.900> down<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.530> disguises<00:01:24.070> that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
that is all down to the disguises that

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.950 
that is all down to the disguises that
I've<00:01:24.550> mentioned<00:01:24.760> quite<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.180> lot<00:01:25.420> previously

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
I've mentioned quite a lot previously

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.390 
I've mentioned quite a lot previously
and<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.230> don't<00:01:26.530> want<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.770> bang<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.040> them<00:01:27.220> too

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
and I don't want to bang on them too

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.250 
and I don't want to bang on them too
much<00:01:27.580> because<00:01:27.640> I'm<00:01:28.330> hoping<00:01:28.720> when<00:01:28.900> you<00:01:28.930> see

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
much because I'm hoping when you see

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.230 
much because I'm hoping when you see
these<00:01:29.409> videos<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.310> patch<00:01:30.520> will<00:01:30.550> be<00:01:30.850> out<00:01:31.000> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
these videos the patch will be out and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.010 
these videos the patch will be out and
the<00:01:31.540> disguises<00:01:32.170> will<00:01:32.500> work<00:01:32.650> perfectly<00:01:33.130> but<00:01:34.020> at

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
the disguises will work perfectly but at

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.899 
the disguises will work perfectly but at
this<00:01:35.080> moment<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.470> time<00:01:35.500> they<00:01:35.800> don't<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.460> that

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
this moment in time they don't so that

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.460 
this moment in time they don't so that
is<00:01:37.060> why<00:01:37.210> I'm<00:01:37.479> acting<00:01:37.659> like<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.020> coward<00:01:38.229> and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
is why I'm acting like a coward and

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.899 
is why I'm acting like a coward and
hiding<00:01:38.800> behind<00:01:38.920> boxes<00:01:39.490> even<00:01:39.640> though

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
hiding behind boxes even though

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.760 
hiding behind boxes even though
technically<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.600> kind<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.200> look<00:01:41.350> like<00:01:41.380> one<00:01:41.740> of

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
technically I kind of look like one of

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.250 
technically I kind of look like one of
the<00:01:41.920> bad<00:01:42.040> guys<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:43.090> just<00:01:43.420> every<00:01:43.659> bad<00:01:43.810> guy<00:01:43.840> has
