00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.890 
and if you don't want to use scavenger
it's<00:02:58.640> best<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.970> go<00:02:59.000> with<00:02:59.120> some<00:02:59.420> stuff<00:02:59.660> like

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's best to go with some stuff like

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.930 
it's best to go with some stuff like
that<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.080> lodestar<00:03:00.950> obviously<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.640> one<00:03:01.820> of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
that and lodestar obviously is one of

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.330 
that and lodestar obviously is one of
the<00:03:02.000> one<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.660> higher<00:03:02.870> ones<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.770> you've<00:03:04.310> got

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
the one of the higher ones so you've got

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.160 
the one of the higher ones so you've got
the<00:03:04.550> chance<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.940> getting<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.510> lot<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.720> kills<00:03:05.990> off

the chance of getting a lot of kills off

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.870 
the chance of getting a lot of kills off
of<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.710> then<00:03:06.770> obviously<00:03:06.920> most<00:03:07.700> of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
the time with a hellstorm missile and a

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
the time with a hellstorm missile and a
lightning<00:03:09.800> strike<00:03:09.980> you're<00:03:10.280> bound<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.640> pick<00:03:10.670> up

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
lightning strike you're bound to pick up

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.760 
lightning strike you're bound to pick up
multis<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.570> triples<00:03:11.959> anyway<00:03:12.230> as<00:03:12.440> you'll<00:03:12.590> see

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
multis in triples anyway as you'll see

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.330 
you'll get some decent game plays but i
did<00:03:38.480> i'd<00:03:38.720> be<00:03:38.780> as<00:03:39.260> saying<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
did i'd be as saying that now and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.400 
did i'd be as saying that now and
towards<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.820> end<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.150> gameplay<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.810> was

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
towards the end of this gameplay I was

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.970 
towards the end of this gameplay I was
up<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.800> top<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.190> room<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.489> well<00:03:43.640> but<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.980> was

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
up the top of the room as well but I was

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.030 
up the top of the room as well but I was
I<00:03:46.310> think<00:03:46.520> I<00:03:46.610> was<00:03:46.760> above<00:03:47.120> or<00:03:47.739> playing<00:03:48.739> where

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
I think I was above or playing where

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.440 
I think I was above or playing where
they<00:03:49.190> was<00:03:49.310> all<00:03:49.430> coming<00:03:49.640> from<00:03:49.880> anyway<00:03:50.209> so<00:03:50.269> it

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
they was all coming from anyway so it

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.850 
they was all coming from anyway so it
wasn't<00:03:50.690> too<00:03:50.720> bad<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:51.019> don't<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.500> tend<00:03:51.739> to

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
wasn't too bad I don't really tend to

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.740 
wasn't too bad I don't really tend to
camp<00:03:52.070> that<00:03:52.160> much<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:52.700> like<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.180> move<00:03:53.330> around<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
camp that much I like to move around the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.320 
camp that much I like to move around the
map<00:03:53.830> it's<00:03:54.830> more<00:03:55.040> enjoyable<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.700> can't<00:03:55.940> see<00:03:56.150> how

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
map it's more enjoyable I can't see how

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.970 
map it's more enjoyable I can't see how

ones<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.350> not<00:04:55.440> hitting<00:04:55.710> them<00:04:55.800> every<00:04:56.010> game

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
ones and not hitting them every game

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.700 
ones and not hitting them every game
maybe<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.610> maybe<00:04:56.760> put<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.240> down<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.750> you'll

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
maybe it maybe put one down and you'll

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.150 
maybe it maybe put one down and you'll
probably<00:04:58.830> see<00:04:59.190> an<00:04:59.730> increase<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.480> your<00:05:01.170> in<00:05:01.740> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
probably see an increase in your in the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.920 
probably see an increase in your in the
amount<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.490> kills<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.880> get<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.300> game<00:05:03.480> so

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
amount of kills you get in a game so
