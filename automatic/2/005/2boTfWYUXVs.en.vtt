00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 adventure time the end of the day tree in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.830
 beauty then was let me do 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.500
 some updates 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.119
 I had made a mark here already 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 part of the tree 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.829
 Let me open the image here and I'll go 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.770
 leave the little one here to build 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:46.379
 then along with details mt pscip 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:48.469
 black and prince and that 's right and I 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 I'll get it out of here soon 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.649
 Yesterday, you realized that you did not have 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 video on then this was because the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 The next time I had passed 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.629
 yesterday was to have a video of the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.850
 minecraft war series which is a series 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.720
 warlike as indigent and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 beauty 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 only that gave a problem that type 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 so I let forcing my videos 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 early in the morning so I do not know that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.689
 work like I do not see the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 video processing if everything is ok and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.790
 does not give time to review it and from there 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 I was put on him yesterday and when I went 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.130
 see is the video processing had 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 fought and had cut some parts 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.220
 margin of video knows idea I solved 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 leave private and even then 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.850
 Another day is the next day I think it's 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.280
 again I think it will come out the second 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.049
 episode and within it will do half 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.049
 with summary of the first episode to 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.700
 you beauty process do not lose from there 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.170
 you will see all there and perhaps 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.250
 because there are a lot of people who 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.020
 do not know the house series but anyway 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.680
 situations aside we will start here 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.439
 do 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.759
 the aac behind the house is because it has a 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.229
 tree of the houses you do not know then 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 leaves a mark are made here already 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:15.290
 It took kind of this here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.819
 It's having to stay here a lot because 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.819
 Let me get from here to here too. 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:35.040
 Just there it's kinda weird like him 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:40.680
 calls this beauty there us here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:49.290
 You can stay a little longer and come 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:53.220
 here a big big and ready there beauty 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.830
 now the problem is that I think three of 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.269
 width for each and so was a tip 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.890
 I'll give it to you if you go. 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.260
 do here and do not care if you fortify 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.480
 Up the other side so you can 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.819
 every year even though it looks more beautiful than 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.120
 normal so type can put everything 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:17.730
 turning even the beauty here the part of 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 Up now let me see back here. 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.820
 because he does not appear in the photo 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.680
 so I'm going to take it off I was not going to take it 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.680
 I'll leave it smaller, will not you? 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.950
 Beauty, the rain gives a cut here in this 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.159
 part 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.040
 and then I'm going to do some things 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.620
 then off, what do you want to do with the 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.060
 details root type so why 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.189
 It will give even if the work does not want 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.840
 cut here inside the video that should 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:03.090
 do off from here 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.620
 these roots and I have to 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.540
 begin to rise to which those parts 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.549
 that's also where I do it off but I 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.680
 I will follow a pattern that the first 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.620
 here is flat three blocks of 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.870
 width and the rest here is that of 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.270
 I'm doing it now, I'm going up it. 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:28.669
 according to the width of the deco 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.669
 for example or show here for you 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.870
 for example there is a part that he 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.930
 goes higher when it rises more 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.210
 type of hand sides so 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.169
 You boot type so she 'll put the hand 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.889
 from the highest to the smallest touch that boots 3 and 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:52.560
 then the boot 2 and will thus continue 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:57.870
 boot like an author who thinks he's good 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.849
 if it does not close the thing some parts 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.380
 so broken here because it's no use 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.220
 nothing left because I'm already going to start 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.020
 upload too 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.919
 and then when you finish uploading 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.409
 these walls you can do is like 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.849
 calls putting some stuff and 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.340
 breaking some like this 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.159
 graphically the type not get everything 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.590
 rest knows why standing right stands 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.720
 Stranger not only let this 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.639
 part is just to make the faÃ§ade of the 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.270
 tree is because the rest I do off 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:41.200
 even for just to later process 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:43.240
 The show here is ending. 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.170
 Let me go to a row here. 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.470
 ahead 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:56.020
 just to make a difference 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:57.910
 And there are those who braun is for me who 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.740
 show that you are climbing the avenue 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.620
 because things do not stay the rules that 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.880
 where strange is taking base to I 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.050
 getting back to the roots will get much better 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:12.780
 then it's off or doing it so lets 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.780
 I leave here just to show you 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:22.750
 and then I let it melt and I'll put the 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.370
 tree leaf with a green because there 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.050
 inside it will not be the ass 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.200
 I'll mobilize in there too then 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.200
 It's gonna be cool, it's cool, I'm here. 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.590
 The guys were talking there too. 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.889
 twitter is with people that I was going to start 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.330
 to bet my video at one point a time 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:52.880
 I think you think you look better. 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:55.850
 Why do people have to wait another hour? 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.950
 of toll could then be published 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.300
 because then I think it's better 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.740
 besides the staff also have approved 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.360
 quite also does not have much difference 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.910
 also published before but 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.700
 anyway it was not I think I have 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.740
 looking around here since you did not know 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.620
 I'm going to leave this episode here. 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.460
 ending here and I'm going to the rest 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.650

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.260
