 explain more or less and capable of 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.490
 chorizo because it enters the same place as

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.160

 Let's go there 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.730
 we do not have which ones are sinning by 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.730
 in front of the suit 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.320
 9 this is the kind of traction I know where 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.320
 they are but 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.420
 or young why we are here 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.290
 they come to us here 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 he was a dead 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.159
 new bastard I was in the kitchen 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.729
 inside 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.440
 dead 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.610
 let's see why 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.689
 let's see if the host 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.200
 behind 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 the dead of the Indian 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 from behind 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.980
 is dead 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.260
 if there were three graves there in the envelope or 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.680
 I had no other idea than tighten them and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.680
 take out the truncheons 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:55.220
 we continue on the other side we can do 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.220
 this now 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 or sit to do it from above and I 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.670
 I have the zip line if we throw and go 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.060

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 escapes escapes 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:32.960
 and here comes all christ endure here 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.910

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.350
 and upload us in this part next to 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.000

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.650

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.650
