has these two squares this balloons in

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.079 
has these two squares this balloons in
gray<00:00:03.629> one<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.290> can<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> UV<00:00:04.890> map<00:00:05.279> you

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
gray one so you can see the UV map you

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.550 
gray one so you can see the UV map you
can<00:00:06.240> also<00:00:06.390> go<00:00:06.810> over<00:00:06.839> here<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.200> hit<00:00:07.350> this

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
can also go over here and hit this

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400

out<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:11.070> dim<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.340> background<00:00:11.940> image<00:00:12.269> say<00:00:12.420> you

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
out to dim the background image say you

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.870 
out to dim the background image say you
can<00:00:12.660> see<00:00:12.870> what's<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.980> here's<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> UV

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
can see what's going on so here's the UV

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.960 
can see what's going on so here's the UV
coordinates<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.699> light

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
coordinates of this some of this light

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.000 
coordinates of this some of this light
fixture<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.050> already<00:00:19.439> went<00:00:19.560> ahead<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
fixture that I've already went ahead and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
fixture that I've already went ahead and
UV<00:00:20.340> map<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> make<00:00:21.900> sure<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
UV map and you have to make sure that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.290 
UV map and you have to make sure that
your<00:00:22.350> object<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> properly<00:00:23.310> UV<00:00:23.670> map<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.090> this

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
your object is properly UV map like this

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.080 
your object is properly UV map like this
or<00:00:24.600> however<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.590> decide<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.010> UV<00:00:26.250> mapping<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
or however you decide the UV mapping to

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
or however you decide the UV mapping to
make<00:00:27.210> sure<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.349> brushed<00:00:28.710> metal<00:00:28.890> look<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
make sure that the brushed metal look is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.550 
make sure that the brushed metal look is
applied<00:00:30.060> correctly<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.140> let<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.320> close<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
applied correctly so let me close that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.069 
applied correctly so let me close that
let<00:00:32.219> me<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.489> back<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> view<00:00:33.030> image<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
let me go back to view image so you can

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.590 
let me go back to view image so you can
see<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> image<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.100> basically<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> image<00:00:35.880> has

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
see the image so basically the image has

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.690 
see the image so basically the image has
these<00:00:36.930> sort<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.260> coins<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.340> could<00:00:38.489> create

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
these sort of coins and you could create

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.020 
these sort of coins and you could create
this<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.270> image<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.840> pretty<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.260> any

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
this this image and pretty much any

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
this this image and pretty much any
image<00:00:42.030> editing<00:00:42.450> program<00:00:42.950> Photoshop<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.160> can

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
image editing program Photoshop you can

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.819 
image editing program Photoshop you can
use<00:00:44.340> Corel<00:00:44.789> Painter<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> use<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.559> GIMP

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
use Corel Painter you can use the GIMP

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
use Corel Painter you can use the GIMP
you<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> lot<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> soft<00:00:48.180> work<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you use a lot of soft work to do this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.340 
you use a lot of soft work to do this
it's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.140> simple<00:00:49.789> image<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.050> these<00:00:52.050> sort

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it's a very simple image of these sort

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's a very simple image of these sort
of<00:00:52.410> metallic<00:00:52.829> cranes<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> make

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of metallic cranes and you want to make

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360 
of metallic cranes and you want to make
sure<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.930> thing's<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> grayscale<00:00:55.980> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
sure that this thing's in a grayscale so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.170 
sure that this thing's in a grayscale so
it's<00:00:56.520> black<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> white

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it's black and white

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's black and white
basically<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.559> brighter<00:00:58.890> areas<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.609> going

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
basically the brighter areas are going

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.310 
basically the brighter areas are going
to<00:01:00.090> determine<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> brush<00:01:01.079> metal

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to determine where the brush metal

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
to determine where the brush metal
strokes<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.520> darker<00:01:02.820> area<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.120> going

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
strokes are and the darker area is going

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.250 
strokes are and the darker area is going
to<00:01:03.300> determine<00:01:03.750> where<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.049> no

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to determine where there's no

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.730 
to determine where there's no
reflectivity<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.580> no<00:01:06.390> specular<00:01:06.960> shade<00:01:07.200> okay

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
reflectivity or no specular shade okay

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.250 
reflectivity or no specular shade okay
and<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.430> brush<00:01:08.790> metal<00:01:09.090> look<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.840> image

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and this brush metal look of this image

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.750 
and this brush metal look of this image
is<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> transfer<00:01:11.369> over<00:01:11.400> into<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
is going to transfer over into a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
is going to transfer over into a
reflection<00:01:12.210> map<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
reflection map and it's gonna make the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
reflection map and it's gonna make the
object<00:01:13.830> look<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
object look like it's got it's like it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
object look like it's got it's like it's
a<00:01:15.869> brush<00:01:16.080> metal<00:01:16.439> surface<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.159> let<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.310> close

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a brush metal surface so let me close

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
a brush metal surface so let me close
that<00:01:17.759> also<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> make<00:01:19.170> sure<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.380> take

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that also I want to make sure I take

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
that also I want to make sure I take
this<00:01:19.860> quadratic<00:01:20.640> filter<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.020> my

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
this quadratic filter off which is on my

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
this quadratic filter off which is on my
default<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:23.100> turn<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> filter<00:01:23.580> off

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
default just turn the filter off

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.990 
default just turn the filter off
completely<00:01:24.479> close<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.130> let's<00:01:26.580> go<00:01:26.729> back

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
completely close that and let's go back

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
completely close that and let's go back
to<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> material<00:01:27.390> attributes<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.159> light

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to the material attributes of the light

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
to the material attributes of the light
fixture<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> brushed<00:01:30.509> metal<00:01:30.770> okay<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
fixture here the brushed metal okay so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.620 
fixture here the brushed metal okay so
now<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.909> reflection<00:01:33.450> map

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
now that I have my reflection map

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
now that I have my reflection map
plugged<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.950> let's<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.579> render

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
plugged in right there let's do render

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350 
plugged in right there let's do render
region<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.909> alright<00:01:38.909> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
region and see what we get alright so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
region and see what we get alright so
this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.799> bit

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
this is what I have it's a little bit

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
this is what I have it's a little bit
difficult<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.509> pretty

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
difficult to see but if you look pretty

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
difficult to see but if you look pretty
closely<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> there's<00:01:44.310> these

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
closely you can see that there's these

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.940 
closely you can see that there's these
source<00:01:44.759> strokes<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.990> sort<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.470> crane

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
source strokes or it is sort of a crane

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
source strokes or it is sort of a crane
that<00:01:47.159> goes<00:01:47.369> horizontally<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.390> that's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that goes horizontally here that's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
that goes horizontally here that's
because<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> reflection<00:01:49.560> map<00:01:50.070> but

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
because of the reflection map but

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.710 
because of the reflection map but
there's<00:01:50.939> another<00:01:51.180> important<00:01:51.630> parameter

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
there's another important parameter

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.859 
there's another important parameter
that's<00:01:52.259> related<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> anisotropy<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that's related to anisotropy that that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.230 
that's related to anisotropy that that
you<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.920> aware<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.610> that's<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you have to be aware of and that's the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.959 
you have to be aware of and that's the
rotation<00:01:57.930> parameter<00:01:58.469> okay<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> very

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
rotation parameter okay this is a very

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.209 
rotation parameter okay this is a very
important<00:02:00.450> parameter<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:01.979> here

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
important parameter as you can see here

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.880 
important parameter as you can see here
up<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> texture<00:02:02.939> sample<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.990> migraine

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
up in the texture sample my migraine

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160 
up in the texture sample my migraine
here<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.729> specular<00:02:06.240> shading<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.780> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
here or my specular shading is going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.800 
here or my specular shading is going
horizontally<00:02:08.009> from<00:02:08.069> left<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
horizontally from left to right if you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
horizontally from left to right if you
change<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> rotation<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.610> see<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
change the rotation you can see the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.760 
change the rotation you can see the
texture<00:02:12.480> sample<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:13.020> here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
texture sample up here

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
texture sample up here
that<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:15.030> specular<00:02:15.630> shading<00:02:15.930> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that that that specular shading is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.770 
that that that specular shading is
actually<00:02:16.860> rotating<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.060> angle<00:02:18.420> is

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
actually rotating and it's angle is

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.890 
actually rotating and it's angle is
changing<00:02:19.440> based<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.490> my<00:02:20.640> rotation<00:02:21.300> down<00:02:21.540> here

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
changing based on my rotation down here

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
changing based on my rotation down here
so<00:02:22.620> let's<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.190> rotation<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.420> 0.25

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
so let's go for rotation of about 0.25

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.190 
so let's go for rotation of about 0.25
so<00:02:25.590> 1/4<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.850> basically<00:02:27.210> make<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.600> thing<00:02:27.810> flip

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
so 1/4 to basically make this thing flip

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.800 
so 1/4 to basically make this thing flip
and<00:02:28.440> make<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.910> down<00:02:30.090> as<00:02:30.390> opposed<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and make it go up and down as opposed to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.300 
and make it go up and down as opposed to
left<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.140> right<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.590> gonna<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.830> vertical

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
left and right so it's gonna be vertical

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.920 
left and right so it's gonna be vertical
now<00:02:32.460> let's<00:02:33.210> go<00:02:33.360> ahead<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.600> render<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
now let's go ahead and render that out

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.580 
now let's go ahead and render that out
again<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.680> around<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.980> region<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.410> we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
again do around the region and there we

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.280 
again do around the region and there we
go<00:02:40.770> basically<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> shading<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.750> going

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
go basically now in the shading is going

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.320 
go basically now in the shading is going
up<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.590> down<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.950> see<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.120> going

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
up and down you see that it's not going

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.450 
up and down you see that it's not going
sideways<00:02:45.930> anymore<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.650> that's<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.280> thing

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
sideways anymore and that's one thing

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.000 
sideways anymore and that's one thing
that<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.700> want<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.000> be<00:02:48.660> aware<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.890> way

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
that you want to be aware of the way

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
that you want to be aware of the way
that<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.310> works<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.240> real<00:02:51.450> world

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
that this works is in the real world

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
that this works is in the real world
when<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.290> brushed<00:02:52.680> metal<00:02:52.770> surface

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
when you have a brushed metal surface

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.200 
when you have a brushed metal surface
the<00:02:54.090> specular<00:02:54.750> shading<00:02:55.080> should<00:02:55.740> always

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
the specular shading should always

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.860 
the specular shading should always
always<00:02:57.210> go<00:02:58.200> perpendicular<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.850> grain<00:03:00.210> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
always go perpendicular to the grain so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
always go perpendicular to the grain so
if<00:03:00.990> your<00:03:01.170> grain<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.670> left<00:03:02.910> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
if your grain is going from left to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.540 
if your grain is going from left to
right<00:03:03.390> your<00:03:03.900> specular<00:03:04.470> shading<00:03:04.740> should<00:03:05.340> go

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
right your specular shading should go

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.080 
right your specular shading should go
from<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.090> bottom<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:07.220> if<00:03:08.220> your<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.850> your

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
from top to bottom and if your if your

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.360 
from top to bottom and if your if your
grain<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.960> if<00:03:10.380> these<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.860> brush<00:03:11.130> metal

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
grain or if these little brush metal

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.150 
grain or if these little brush metal
strokes<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.150> your<00:03:12.660> image<00:03:12.930> they<00:03:13.560> are<00:03:13.890> going

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
strokes in your image they are going

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.130 
strokes in your image they are going
from<00:03:14.400> top<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.730> bottom<00:03:14.940> if<00:03:15.420> they're<00:03:15.570> vertical

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
from top to bottom if they're vertical

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.810 
from top to bottom if they're vertical
you<00:03:16.620> want<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.890> make<00:03:16.980> sure<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.370> specular

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
you want to make sure that the specular

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.320 
you want to make sure that the specular
shading<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:19.560> horizontal<00:03:20.400> because

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
shading here is going horizontal because

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.610 
shading here is going horizontal because
that's<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.690> way<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.840> works<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.260> works<00:03:22.380> by

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that's the way it works it works by

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.430 
that's the way it works it works by
opposites<00:03:23.630> that's<00:03:24.630> just<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> way<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.350> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
opposites that's just the way that it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
opposites that's just the way that it
works<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.830> real<00:03:25.860> life<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:26.940> you're<00:03:27.060> trying

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
works in real life so if you're trying

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.390 
works in real life so if you're trying
to<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.570> photorealistic<00:03:28.050> brush<00:03:28.620> metal<00:03:28.950> surface

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
to do photorealistic brush metal surface

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.550 
to do photorealistic brush metal surface
you<00:03:29.880> need<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.420> make<00:03:30.600> sure<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> pay

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you need to make sure that you pay

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.040 
you need to make sure that you pay
attention<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:32.580> this<00:03:32.700> rotation<00:03:33.390> parameter<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
attention to this rotation parameter and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.280 
attention to this rotation parameter and
also<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.070> orientation<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.510> grain<00:03:36.840> and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
also the orientation of the grain and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.800 
also the orientation of the grain and
your<00:03:37.530> texture<00:03:37.920> image<00:03:38.250> or<00:03:38.400> else<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.360> shadings

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
your texture image or else the shadings

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.810 
your texture image or else the shadings
gonna<00:03:39.990> come<00:03:40.200> out<00:03:40.320> completely<00:03:40.920> wrong<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.430> it's

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
gonna come out completely wrong and it's

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.150 
gonna come out completely wrong and it's
not<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.209> look<00:03:42.300> realistic<00:03:42.720> okay<00:03:43.620> so

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
not going to look realistic okay so

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.650 
not going to look realistic okay so
there<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.490> go<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:44.820> now<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.180> have<00:03:45.330> these<00:03:45.420> nice

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
there we go so now we have these nice

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
there we go so now we have these nice
grains<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.350> basically<00:03:47.070> we've<00:03:47.280> created<00:03:47.520> this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
grains and basically we've created this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.360 
grains and basically we've created this
nice<00:03:48.120> brushed<00:03:48.930> metal<00:03:49.170> look<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.010> our<00:03:50.130> surface

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
nice brushed metal look to our surface

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.780 
nice brushed metal look to our surface
so<00:03:51.030> now<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.240> got<00:03:51.390> these<00:03:51.480> parameters<00:03:52.020> set<00:03:52.230> up

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
so now we got these parameters set up

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.820 
so now we got these parameters set up
that<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:54.510> pretty<00:03:54.810> much<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.170> gonna<00:03:55.320> do<00:03:55.530> it

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
that that pretty much is gonna do it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.670 
that that pretty much is gonna do it
that's<00:03:56.190> our<00:03:56.430> brushed<00:03:56.760> metal<00:03:56.970> surface<00:03:57.810> okay<00:03:58.620> so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
that's our brushed metal surface okay so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
that's our brushed metal surface okay so
let's<00:03:59.010> close<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.520> let's<00:03:59.910> also<00:04:00.090> close<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
let's close that let's also close the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.040 
let's close that let's also close the
render<00:04:01.260> view<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:02.030> alright<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.690> I'm<00:04:03.750> finish

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
render view here alright so I'm finish

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.710 
render view here alright so I'm finish
the<00:04:04.230> scene<00:04:04.470> off<00:04:04.680> let<00:04:05.250> me<00:04:05.280> actually<00:04:05.540> unhide<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
the scene off let me actually unhide the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.080 
the scene off let me actually unhide the
light<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.170> had<00:04:07.350> here<00:04:07.590> before<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.670> I'll

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
light that I had here before so I'll

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.780 
light that I had here before so I'll
I'll<00:04:09.900> go<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.320> hotbox<00:04:10.770> I'll<00:04:11.130> go<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.400> window

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
I'll go to the hotbox I'll go to window

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.020 
I'll go to the hotbox I'll go to window
and<00:04:12.030> I'll<00:04:12.510> open<00:04:12.780> up<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.020> outliner<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:14.030> see

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and I'll open up the outliner and see

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.280 
and I'll open up the outliner and see
the<00:04:15.090> outline<00:04:15.420> there's<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.660> list<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.989> all<00:04:16.140> the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
the outline there's a list of all the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.470 
the outline there's a list of all the
objects<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:16.709> my<00:04:16.770> scene<00:04:17.100> any<00:04:17.340> objects<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.330> are

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
objects in my scene any objects that are

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.020 
objects in my scene any objects that are
hidden<00:04:18.750> right<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:19.230> will<00:04:19.919> be<00:04:20.160> will<00:04:20.609> have<00:04:20.820> their

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
hidden right now will be will have their

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.110 
hidden right now will be will have their
name<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.540> blue<00:04:22.500> text<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:23.130> dark<00:04:23.669> blue<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
name in blue text in dark blue so it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.020 
name in blue text in dark blue so it
might<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> little<00:04:24.630> bit<00:04:24.720> difficult<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.229> see

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
might be a little bit difficult to see

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.970 
might be a little bit difficult to see
but<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.270> this<00:04:27.450> one<00:04:27.660> right<00:04:27.690> here<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.680> it's<00:04:28.800> dis

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
but it's this one right here so it's dis

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.650 
but it's this one right here so it's dis
light<00:04:29.220> here<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.550> dark<00:04:29.820> blue<00:04:30.060> which<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.420> the

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
light here in dark blue which is the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.750 
light here in dark blue which is the
ceiling<00:04:31.320> light<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:31.889> just<00:04:32.130> select<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.580> and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
ceiling light so just select it and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.400 
ceiling light so just select it and
we'll<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.150> selected<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.660> hold<00:04:33.900> down<00:04:34.050> shift

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
we'll get selected to hold down shift

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.820 
we'll get selected to hold down shift
and<00:04:34.650> hit<00:04:34.800> H<00:04:35.010> on<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.310> keyboard<00:04:35.730> to<00:04:35.850> unhide<00:04:36.270> it

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
and hit H on the keyboard to unhide it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.730 
and hit H on the keyboard to unhide it
close<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.639> now<00:04:38.760> our<00:04:38.790> light<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.210> back<00:04:39.740> okay

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
close that so now our light is back okay

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.920 
close that so now our light is back okay
so<00:04:41.340> now<00:04:41.430> let's<00:04:41.610> go<00:04:41.730> back<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> view<00:04:42.480> options

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
so now let's go back to the view options

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.320 
so now let's go back to the view options
here<00:04:43.169> for<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> camera<00:04:44.070> viewport<00:04:44.580> let's<00:04:45.150> go<00:04:45.270> to

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
here for the camera viewport let's go to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.960 
here for the camera viewport let's go to
bookmarks<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:46.050> let's<00:04:46.230> go<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.440> render<00:04:46.650> one

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
bookmarks and let's go to render one

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.659 
bookmarks and let's go to render one
okay<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.830> next<00:04:49.830> thing<00:04:49.919> we<00:04:49.980> probably<00:04:50.310> want<00:04:50.610> to

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
okay and next thing we probably want to

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.430 
okay and next thing we probably want to
do<00:04:50.790> just<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:51.060> finish<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.510> thing<00:04:51.570> off<00:04:51.930> is

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
do just to finish this thing off is

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.310 
do just to finish this thing off is
increase<00:04:53.160> all<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.030> parameters<00:04:54.540> for<00:04:54.870> the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
increase all of the parameters for the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.890 
increase all of the parameters for the
objects<00:04:55.770> in<00:04:56.580> our<00:04:56.730> scene<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.540> this<00:04:57.690> thing

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
objects in our scene so this thing

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.720 
objects in our scene so this thing
renders<00:04:58.200> out<00:04:58.350> good<00:04:58.560> because<00:04:58.830> right<00:04:59.070> now<00:04:59.220> if<00:04:59.490> I

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
renders out good because right now if I

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.850 
renders out good because right now if I
do<00:04:59.790> a<00:04:59.910> render<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.960> renders<00:05:01.260> out<00:05:01.410> pretty<00:05:01.620> fast

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
do a render it renders out pretty fast

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.850 
do a render it renders out pretty fast
only<00:05:02.310> 16<00:05:02.820> seconds<00:05:03.360> but<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.230> can<00:05:04.350> see<00:05:04.590> this

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
only 16 seconds but as you can see this

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.550 
only 16 seconds but as you can see this
the<00:05:05.430> quality<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.060> this<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.419> horrible<00:05:07.230> there's

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
the quality of this is horrible there's

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.010 
the quality of this is horrible there's
graininess<00:05:08.160> and<00:05:08.460> artifacts<00:05:09.060> all<00:05:09.330> over<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
graininess and artifacts all over the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.890 
graininess and artifacts all over the
place<00:05:10.260> this<00:05:11.010> thing<00:05:11.310> just<00:05:11.550> looks<00:05:11.760> it's<00:05:12.450> totally

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
place this thing just looks it's totally

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.840 
place this thing just looks it's totally
unacceptable<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.190> what<00:05:14.340> I'm<00:05:14.400> going<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.610> do<00:05:14.760> is

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
unacceptable so what I'm going to do is

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.850 
unacceptable so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:14.940> going<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.150> end<00:05:15.300> this<00:05:15.390> video<00:05:15.570> here<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.320> in

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.480 
the next video very quickly we're just
going<00:05:19.140> to<00:05:19.169> go<00:05:19.350> into<00:05:19.560> all<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.860> shaders<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.370> we

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
going to go into all the shaders that we

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.090 
going to go into all the shaders that we
need<00:05:20.669> to<00:05:20.850> increase<00:05:21.630> any<00:05:22.020> parameters<00:05:22.979> and

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
need to increase any parameters and

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.950 
need to increase any parameters and
quality<00:05:23.610> settings<00:05:23.910> we<00:05:24.060> need<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.390> increase<00:05:24.810> our

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
quality settings we need to increase our

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.320 
quality settings we need to increase our
render<00:05:25.260> settings<00:05:25.590> and<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:26.550> do<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:26.910> final

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
render settings and just do a final

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.659 
render settings and just do a final
render<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.919> we'll<00:05:29.130> do<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.280> in<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.490> next

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
render so we'll do that in the next

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.810 
render so we'll do that in the next
video<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.210> I'll<00:05:30.389> see<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.660> there
