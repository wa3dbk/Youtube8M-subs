of checking and maintaining the proper
bridge<00:00:23.660> orientation<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:25.410> gonna

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bridge orientation now I'm gonna

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.349 
bridge orientation now I'm gonna
actually<00:00:26.180> show<00:00:27.180> how<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.580> change<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.849> bridge<00:00:30.060> yeah

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
actually show how I change a bridge yeah

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
actually show how I change a bridge yeah
that<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> significant<00:00:31.500> pull<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that was a significant pull it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
that was a significant pull it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
your in your legs and then you what I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.380 
your in your legs and then you what I
tend<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.879> put<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.120> thumb's<00:00:58.789> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.180> side

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
tend to do is put my thumb's on the side

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
tend to do is put my thumb's on the side
of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> bridge<00:01:00.780> closest<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> me<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of the bridge closest to me and then I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.060 
of the bridge closest to me and then I
put<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.550> second<00:01:03.120> fingers<00:01:03.680> opposite<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.799> thumbs

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
put my second fingers opposite my thumbs

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
put my second fingers opposite my thumbs
and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:05.729> first<00:01:06.150> fingers<00:01:06.600> roughly

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and I put my first fingers roughly

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
and I put my first fingers roughly
opposite<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.799> thumbs<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.729> first

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
opposite my thumbs and see how my first

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500 
opposite my thumbs and see how my first
fingers<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:10.560> between<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.030> E<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
fingers are between the E and the a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.789 
fingers are between the E and the a
between<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.740> G<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> D<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.770> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
between the G and the D now I have a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.690 
between the G and the D now I have a
relatively<00:01:17.720> controllable<00:01:19.220> grip<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
relatively controllable grip on the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
relatively controllable grip on the
bridge<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:23.900> very<00:01:24.900> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
bridge now what I will do is very very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.060 
bridge now what I will do is very very
slowly<00:01:26.450> ease<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.780> bridge<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:28.770> bit

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
slowly ease the bridge back a little bit

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.690 
slowly ease the bridge back a little bit
how<00:01:29.729> much<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.270> can't<00:01:30.750> tell<00:01:31.049> unless<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.100> once

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
how much I can't tell unless I once

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.230 
how much I can't tell unless I once
again<00:01:32.909> eyeball<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.590> bridge<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:36.030> my

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
again eyeball the bridge and in my

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.069 
again eyeball the bridge and in my
opinion<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.909> still<00:01:39.270> leaning<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.049> little

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
opinion that is still leaning a little

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.800 
opinion that is still leaning a little
bit<00:01:40.470> forward<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> repeat<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
bit forward so I'm going to repeat the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.910 
bit forward so I'm going to repeat the
process<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.720> gonna<00:01:45.869> probably<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
process and I'm gonna probably do this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.609 
process and I'm gonna probably do this
two<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.310> times<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.590> be

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
two more times and I know it can be

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.920 
two more times and I know it can be
boring<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.220> watch<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.210> maybe<00:01:51.689> one

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
boring to watch me do this but maybe one

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.060 
boring to watch me do this but maybe one
more<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:54.000> idea<00:01:54.360> being<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.070> these

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
more time the idea being that these

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
more time the idea being that these
movements<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.909> best<00:01:57.180> done<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:59.780> modest

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
movements are best done in modest

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
movements are best done in modest
amounts<00:02:01.500> rather<00:02:01.799> than<00:02:02.100> trying<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.700> pull

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
amounts rather than trying to just pull

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.080 
amounts rather than trying to just pull
the<00:02:03.420> bridge<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.229> once<00:02:04.850> which<00:02:05.850> could

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the bridge back all at once which could

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.859 
the bridge back all at once which could
break<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.829> I'm<00:02:07.829> gonna<00:02:08.009> call<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.280> good<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.720> we

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
break it I'm gonna call that good so we

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.059 
break it I'm gonna call that good so we
could<00:02:10.020> say<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> string

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
could say that the a string

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.580 
could say that the a string
with<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.879> little<00:02:13.450> bit<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.659> stretching<00:02:14.879> huh<00:02:15.879> is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
with a little bit of stretching huh is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:40.319 
with a little bit of stretching huh is
going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:18.599> hopefully<00:02:38.639> I'm<00:02:39.639> tuning<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.180> age

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
going to be hopefully I'm tuning the age

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.879 
going to be hopefully I'm tuning the age
of<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.599> e<00:02:40.629> because<00:02:40.989> that's<00:02:41.319> an<00:02:41.439> old<00:02:41.560> string

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
of the e because that's an old string

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.149 
of the e because that's an old string
and<00:02:42.040> isn't<00:02:42.250> stretching<00:02:42.639> anymore

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
and isn't stretching anymore

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.460

these<00:02:45.159> strings<00:02:45.519> are<00:02:46.049> new<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.319> they<00:02:47.439> are

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
these strings are new and they are

these strings are new and they are
