00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.760
 hello her son him now still a baby 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.680
 shower fondant top tutorial and indeed 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.230
 that my duck being the elongated one 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.220
 that I'll make it a rounder one 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.790
 do I use yellow orange and for that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.040
 black 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.349
 good that on the black pen 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.580
 The eyes are not as big as mine 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 you have to look I am now first 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.940
 one demanding a yellow part which he is 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 I would both have the same course so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 Of course you can make it bigger, though 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.520
 I do not want that in the case and 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.650
 Roll me now as always 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 principle, a ball of ice rolls off 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:57.540
 land had to do so and now I'm doing it 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.640
 a drop before and that I do that 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.640
 so where I here palm with the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 or long roll and already I have here 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.229
 I hope you have seen it so far 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 high coach so in the palm of my hand I go 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.030
 here so long and then I have here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.140
 already my roots 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.060
 I always leave that up here 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710
 still ferrero is okay exercise does that 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.659
 master 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 also that again away and even more away 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 So it fits a role 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.289
 that's okay that's a tremendous one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.689
 nice ball shape now I can tell you 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.770
 that show at least once 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.299
 Now I go to the palm-do 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.149
 I drop a drop 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.590
 that is difficult and always better 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.479
 the more you do this on her 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.899
 I have my dripping 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 I'm working here now that will be like this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.459
 a little bit out of it for a bit 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.850
 flatten them what higher as well 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.829
 always 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.450
 that 's it my duck will be this time 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.840
 a bit thicker than last 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.940
 now i need a head i watch 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 that it fits too much again 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.959
 I think very well 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.349
 I will also read more about the country here 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.349
 rightly roll 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.960
 and can try to make it that way 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.940
 but in principle this is actually in 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.200
 to want my palms and that 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.590
 You can also do that someday 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.870
 down 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.420
 it really just comes up here 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:52.660
 if you like it you can do it 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:54.880
 up I stick it does not make my is 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.000
 It's really so humid that I do not 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.370
 you need now but you need 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.990
 not all cool i take this tool 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.270
 here 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:12.760
 that's really great around here 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.800
 Carefully push her fins down her 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.980
 Looks good 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.980
 and here we can do the same 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:28.930
 can you handle it a bit ? 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:33.609
 press otherwise is a little thicker hab 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:38.370
 shut yourself in here so now 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:42.639
 I take a bit orange 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.629
 really very little because they are almost 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.780
 so much I think times does see the 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.560
 also back to a role 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.879
 and then I'm looking forward to it now 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.739
 a small tip holds neither 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.150
 again so or so that could and 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.359
 then I have the pass or synonymous 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.200
 the big, for example, my estimate 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.370
 that's great now 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:15.700
 I take the half away and do the whole thing 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.500
 again from a small tip 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.759
 to form 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.829
 By the way , you can do the whole thing afterwards 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.610
 of course , a little bit after 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.010
 shape and broaden and so on 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.449
 or even with pixar up that it 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.909
 leave it up to you how you do that 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:39.940
 I have now made black pen 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:48.930
 or color though i could of course 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.930
 even with the wolves colors black times 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:03.080
 but a black but can not handle 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.160
 you can see I've got such a hands do 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.590
 I change that, I suppose 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.320
 a bit more 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:19.000
 all this and then snip that 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:27.710
 I actually rather of and have 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.790
 two sensible little points 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.130
 I do not need any more in front of the big ones 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.130
 of course to the side and the small 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:48.820
 on the side of the now is about home team 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:50.990
 we want to roll this one a bit 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.690
 and then be careful here a bit 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.260
 let it dry 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.260
 the better 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:13.979
 Best again with water or glue 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.979
 light in the eyes 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.919
 and then 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.919
 put the dots on 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.299
 so 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.930
 and at least two are done 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.710
 decided 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.409
 I hope I like it , I hope 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.839
 you can copy it is mine 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:03.169
 detention understood 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:08.249
 then I wish you much fun 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:10.830
 subscribe me but ask me what if 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.649
 you want me to do that 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:17.610
 look at my blog you can 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:19.849

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.849
 ihome
