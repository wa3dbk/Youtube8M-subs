you cling film your surface down but
what<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.630> goes<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:11.280> click

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
what we do is that goes there that click

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.560 
what we do is that goes there that click
one<00:01:12.240> side<00:01:12.479> click<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.619> done<00:01:14.420> hardly<00:01:15.420> any

pressure<00:01:15.960> drop<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.460> technique<00:01:18.530> I'll

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
pressure drop my it is a technique I'll

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950 
pressure drop my it is a technique I'll
show<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.860> again<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> you'd<00:01:21.659> offer<00:01:21.810> you

needle runner-up that goes on their

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.490 
needle runner-up that goes on their
fingers<00:01:26.670> either<00:01:26.820> side<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.930> tend<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.259> click

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
fingers either side and I tend to click

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
fingers either side and I tend to click
the<00:01:28.650> left<00:01:28.770> one<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.280> first<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.780> the
