on<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.520> higher<00:00:47.760> rep<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.450> well<00:00:48.660> now

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
on some higher rep work as well now

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
on some higher rep work as well now
obviously<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.920> said<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> compound<00:00:50.760> lift

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
obviously like I said the compound lift

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
obviously like I said the compound lift
should<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.719> main<00:00:52.020> focus<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:53.129> stronger

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
should be your main focus get stronger

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
should be your main focus get stronger
with<00:00:53.789> those<00:00:54.030> lifts<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.600> let<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.079> the

either<00:00:59.270> don't<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.390> scared<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.930> 15<00:01:01.410> 20<00:01:01.800> 25

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
either don't be scared to go 15 20 25
