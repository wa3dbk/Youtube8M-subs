00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.470
 in this video we will show how to do the 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.200
 1.1.2 jailbreak I know it already exists 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.879
 the 1 point 1.3 but have it in a point 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.089
 commented then it is an important step 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:18.140
 to do the 1.93 jailbreak first 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.470
 we do the 1.1.1 jailbreak for that 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.770
 we went on safari 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.160
 and we go to the page 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
 yes 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.780
 man 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.780
 to me 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 cover my doctor dotcom 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.350
 we go down to this app it explains 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 and it will start to be the analog of the file 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 wait for all this to happen it will reset 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 the streamwork when it comes back will be already 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.930
 list them 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.470
 Now what we need is that although 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470
 the install 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 I'll wait for the 066 horse 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.900
 the crystal of the park and low 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.050
 the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.550
 you look for horn 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.360
 a package called doctor press 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.360
 and we show 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.090
 okay 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.270
 well now that we have that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.020
 we are going to make different and we will 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 the counter connected to the counter 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.980
 today we came on itunes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.160
 as you can see it is still in point 1.1 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.340
 and for this you need to do the boc 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.580
 shoot 1.1.2 only in this way 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.120
 they are grabbing the chip and they are playing in you 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.690
 and there in the description of the video 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.860
 botero nor for this file 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.400
 if you need to lower what is the frame 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.710
 1.1.2 installs and this will delay 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.460
 some minutes then we will turn off the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.760
 camera to be faster for you 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.930
 well now we have the ipad 1.1.2 but 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 still with tie-break 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.140
 what we need to do is sell that 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.430
 tips and make sure that the outlook is 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.430
 never 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.980
 after that we come to the accountant 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.290
 we closed the itunes 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.590
 and everything all applies all 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.989
 support processes or itunes or any 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.490
 thing like that here and I have them all 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.100
 closed then I would not need running 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.080
 there are assets in this file that will be in 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.940
 the description of the video and if we are 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.940
 using windows windows 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
 now this box will appear you expect a 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.890
 little leads to appear this wants 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.060
 installing the csh is optional there are clinics 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.489
 in geo break 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.489

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.650
 good to finish everything that was 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.350

 good now we will have the ipad again 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.610

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.860

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.860

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.729
 let's say ok 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.769
 the ipad will automatically turn off more 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.870
 at once 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.090
 but it will automatically turn on only 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.090
 Sunday field we should close this 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.700
