00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
look I've played Donkey Kong Country so

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.590 
look I've played Donkey Kong Country so
many<00:03:23.650> times<00:03:23.890> I'm<00:03:24.790> pretty<00:03:25.090> sure<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.270> could<00:03:25.360> play

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
many times I'm pretty sure I could play

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.360 
many times I'm pretty sure I could play
some<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.930> these<00:03:25.990> levels<00:03:26.230> blindfolded<00:03:27.070> and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
some of these levels blindfolded and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.370 
some of these levels blindfolded and
that's<00:03:28.030> why<00:03:28.180> I'm<00:03:28.270> telling<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.720> don't<00:03:28.930> think

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
that's why I'm telling you I don't think

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.140 
that's why I'm telling you I don't think
these<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.890> same<00:03:30.040> levels<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.880> lot<00:03:31.030> of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
these are the same levels like a lot of

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
them have been reworked and even though

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.920 
them have been reworked and even though
it's<00:03:32.770> mostly<00:03:33.160> subtle<00:03:33.640> stuff<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.600> pretty

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
it's mostly subtle stuff it's pretty

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.900 
it's mostly subtle stuff it's pretty

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
stiff and actually what's even worse is

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.600 
stiff and actually what's even worse is
that<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:29.200> can't<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> damn<00:04:30.040> thing<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.490> this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
that you can't see a damn thing in this

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.430 
that you can't see a damn thing in this
game<00:04:30.669> see<00:04:31.300> because<00:04:31.570> they<00:04:31.720> wanted<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.200> look

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
game see because they wanted it to look

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.380 
game see because they wanted it to look
like<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.800> original<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:33.430> much<00:04:33.730> as<00:04:33.880> possible

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
like the original as much as possible

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.540 
like the original as much as possible
they<00:04:34.960> use<00:04:35.140> this<00:04:35.380> really<00:04:35.950> zoomed<00:04:36.340> in

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
they use this really zoomed in

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.040 
they use this really zoomed in
perspective<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:37.480> they<00:04:37.570> could<00:04:37.720> get<00:04:37.840> more

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
perspective so they could get more

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.620 
perspective so they could get more
detailed<00:04:38.470> sprites<00:04:38.770> but<00:04:39.370> unfortunately<00:04:40.090> that

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
detailed sprites but unfortunately that

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.090 
detailed sprites but unfortunately that
means<00:04:40.750> your<00:04:40.990> visibility<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.560> horrendous

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
means your visibility is horrendous

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.620 
means your visibility is horrendous
especially<00:04:42.730> in<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:42.970> mine<00:04:43.300> cart<00:04:43.600> levels

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.860 
in the slightest
I<00:05:32.800> mean<00:05:33.280> maybe<00:05:33.490> 15<00:05:33.940> years<00:05:33.970> ago<00:05:34.270> this<00:05:34.480> was<00:05:34.630> cool

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
I mean maybe 15 years ago this was cool

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.960 
I mean maybe 15 years ago this was cool
in<00:05:35.110> fact<00:05:35.290> I'm<00:05:35.440> pretty<00:05:35.500> sure<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:35.860> was<00:05:36.070> the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
in fact I'm pretty sure it was the
