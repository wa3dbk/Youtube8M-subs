 I bought a steamer, I began to do 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 almost every day fish in a double boiler 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.649
 meat vegetables and cereals so on vitamins 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 remain in the food itself and rightly so 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.220

 I use a double boiler, this is the right thing, I 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.670
 I think that she should be further in the house 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.119
 I bought a blender in the summer and everything 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.479
 cocktails and a refreshing smoothie could 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.580
 the brazier did not ride thirst to get enough and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.009
 Generally a very cool thing I have not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.400
 Loved the cottage cheese I decided to include in 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 my diet so i am now i 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.790
 skin will improve and now here if you 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.970
 annoyed I could not let go somewhere 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.149

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.320
 I am painted 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.750
 I just have enough powder and go to 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 street to school and there 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.550
 Ali 2 because proper nutrition 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.220
 affected my body i want to say something 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.380
 that i didn't set myself a goal 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.350
 lose weight i mean i didn't think so 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.900
 just for the sake of the skin but in general I lost weight 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.300
 I donâ€™t know how many kilos because 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.850
 that i don't know i weigh i don't 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.459
 bother place thinner 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.650
 diet in like a proper diet she 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.650
 much more useful than you will torment 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.630
 I do not have less hunger 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.959
 against some kind of diets 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.690
 but it's still better if you're going 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.520
 lose weight then either lose weight and here on 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.489
 food or go people sense 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.630
 who will write you a menu list 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.610
 there are a lot of nutritionists who 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.970
 running online follow this spit 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.970
 porn 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.360
 you throw off your options and they 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.000
 write down that is give you a menu and so 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.020
 further but usually diets are not enough for you 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.390
 must still play sports 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.730
 keep fit and so that is 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.730
 month you properly soaked lost weight 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 and then you started again and you have everything 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.350
 ate before the diet such chips crackers and my 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.030
 a given is therefore needed and physical 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.670
 loads even some kind of charging through 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.220
 a day is enough to keep fit 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.930
 I'm doing exercises too every other day 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.690
 in the summer I was running 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.610
 if the waters go abroad and there are 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.900
 the pool is take this opportunity I 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.140
 right that he wants to swim in the sea 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.329
 it goes without saying but every day you can 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.620
 swim there not for how many there 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.570
 kilometers 25 meters you swim it 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.420
 the body somehow work differently you 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.470
 somehow you will feel better and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.200
 the main rule that is if you want 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.660
 eat properly fight one and the same 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.390

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.840

 help my advice 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.780
 but don't care if you 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:12.540
 there you are 14 16 years old do not even touch yourself 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.580
 if you are very full try to eat 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.890
 right but do not torture yourself diets 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.920
 because you can break the metabolism 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.980
 and then it will be a million times worse and 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.650
 then you will suffer and will be treated 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.380
