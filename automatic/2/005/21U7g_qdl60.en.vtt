00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.270

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 well that each and all of these 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.770
 injustice I hope you are well 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.449
 that you have the flanders 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.650
 nickel today we find ourselves for 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.060
 a new video that we could see 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.980
 in the title is the list the list 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.419
 rather trophies or successes you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 can unlock in the second 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.230
 episode of two extinctions so 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.460
 the episode mayday actually these 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.570
 trophies were unveiled a few years ago 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 hours so today I'm doing you 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.830
 part of this little list of trophies 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.449
 I hope this little video you 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.680
 please I just have to specify another 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.720
 little thing is I'm going to say 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 often too much son the former ps3 player 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.989
 so I usually say to say 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.640
 trophy said well in I will put you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
 the link from my source to descriptions 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 so without further ado we start with 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.339
 the first extinction trophy so 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 but to reach the freighter regardless of the 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.059
 difficulty so in first medea 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 trophy which is obviously obvious the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 simpler then the next to reach 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 the top of the boat in May and full 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.689
 bears the difficulty so this service 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.729
 to be the simple then on turns into 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.189
 medea then kill the kraken for the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 first time in the episode help me 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 no matter how difficult I do not know 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560
 how you kraken it I have none 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.470
 idea 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.690
 then the next one so kill the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 kraken using a relic of made 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.480
 and no matter the hassle and so has he 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
 are two different ways in 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.900
 you who tells us to kill him once and the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.380
 kill with a relic 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.170
 so here is to complete my ideas 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.240
 so succeed all the challenges of medea 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.250
 no matter how difficult then 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 am seeker find all the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.370
 information in medea because 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.770
 reflection will be able to look for small 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.060
 folders in this game mode of the little ones 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.650
 small information of small 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.909
 files 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.159
 I do not know exactly how it works 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.710
 but we'll see all this when the dlc will be 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.350
 then released the following deforestation 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 killed 15 sidr and yes the six hours that 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920
 are the new ones the new ones a little 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 little scorpion sorts the new ones 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.190
 and new eliane who will you have 15.6 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.180
 of gold in one part in medea little 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.940
 does not matter the difficulty then use 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.250
 an iep our app so for their 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.900
 hymn to the seniors a rhinoceros of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.640
 come with you then the hypnos and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.050
 finally the knives it seems to me that you 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.000
 throw on the lines for it to be 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.880
 with you so that's a challenge the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.690
 throw on the rhinoceros 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.420
 then then complete it all 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.370
 extras the eagles the extras so I 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.500
 do not know exactly what it is in the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.750
 dlc devastation so it does not look 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.040
 just extinction it seems to be finally 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.690
 its just value to relate to 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.400
 the extinction pay of concern 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.560
 also of multiplayer saw that wade is 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.420
 little easter egg surely among others 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.700
 the one we could have so on a 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.010
 earth aid losc we unlock the v9x so 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.340
 we will have to unlock all the easter 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.560
 egg and finally the architect 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.880
 build a cowardly and matic to help me 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.380
 no matter how difficult 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.940
 so here it was the presentation of 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.989
 all these trophies pretty much a little 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.090
 ten trophies 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.519
 it's really or pretty short video 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.660
 just to show you the trophies 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.000
 I hope that you will have more to us 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.380
 give indications on a little bit 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.400
 how is it going to look like fashion and I 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.780
 think it might be a way of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.850
 much more complete game gets set d and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.709
 I can not wait to see what's going 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.700
 give obviously to try it so 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.320
 I listen to them I hope this 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.489
 little video you more is the case 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.200
 little green thumb as I say to 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.579

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.500
 the source for all who would be 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.000
 still a little skeptical after 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.170
 this video it will be time description 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.370
