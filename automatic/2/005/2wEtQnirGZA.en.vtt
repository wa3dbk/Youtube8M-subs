so the samsung galaxy s6 has had quite a

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.499 
so the samsung galaxy s6 has had quite a
few<00:00:11.010> improvements<00:00:11.400> when<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> comes<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
few improvements when it comes to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.150 
few improvements when it comes to
security<00:00:13.080> specifically<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
security specifically we're going to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.189 
security specifically we're going to
talk<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.910> fingerprint<00:00:15.599> scanner<00:00:15.900> in

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
talk about the fingerprint scanner in

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.620 
talk about the fingerprint scanner in
today's<00:00:16.590> video<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.539> ahead

today's video so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:19.410> into<00:00:19.650> security<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.240> can

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and go into security and you can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.849 
and go into security and you can
actually<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.020> easily<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.590> at

actually get to it easily right here at

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.839 
actually get to it easily right here at
the<00:00:22.920> top<00:00:23.160> lock<00:00:23.609> screen<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.500> security<00:00:25.500> and

the top lock screen and security and
right<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.150> fingerprint<00:00:27.779> scanner<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.250> first

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
right here fingerprint scanner so first

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.189 
right here fingerprint scanner so first
things<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.330> you've<00:00:30.449> never<00:00:30.689> set<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.140> up

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
things first if you've never set this up

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
things first if you've never set this up
you<00:00:31.949> won't<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> book<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.759> I've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you won't get this book because I've

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.310 
you won't get this book because I've
already<00:00:33.180> set<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.630> I've<00:00:33.840> got<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.230> ahead

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
already set it up I've got to go ahead

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.959 
already set it up I've got to go ahead
and<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.250> prove<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.600> me<00:00:37.790> there<00:00:38.790> we

I've added my my pointer finger and I've
added<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.039> thumb<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.910> hand<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> my

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
going to go ahead and show you guys how
to<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> set<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to kind of set this up so basically you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
to kind of set this up so basically you
come<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.110> had<00:00:55.350> don't

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
come in here and you probably had don't

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
come in here and you probably had don't
have<00:00:55.710> fingers<00:00:55.920> listed<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
have fingers listed it probably just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.610 
have fingers listed it probably just
says<00:00:57.120> add<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> finger<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.199> we're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> go

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
says add a finger so we're going to go

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.369 
says add a finger so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.960> basically<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
ahead and do that and it basically just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
ahead and do that and it basically just
tells<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> keep<00:01:02.100> putting<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.520> finger<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
tells you to keep putting your finger on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
tells you to keep putting your finger on
and<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> button<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.860> I'm

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and off and on and off the button so I'm

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.230 
and off and on and off the button so I'm
going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.519> my<00:01:05.549> thumb<00:01:06.060> right

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
going to do that with my thumb right

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.420 
going to do that with my thumb right
here<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> go<00:01:07.290> ahead<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.530> place<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> down

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
here so I go ahead and place it down

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
here so I go ahead and place it down
there<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> says<00:01:09.380> four<00:01:10.380> percent<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there you see it says four percent and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.320 
there you see it says four percent and
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.340> starting<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.760> kind<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you can see it's starting to kind of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.530 
you can see it's starting to kind of
have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> fingerprint<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> i

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
have a fingerprint up here so i

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.770 
have a fingerprint up here so i
recommend<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.890> ahead<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.780> do

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
recommend to go ahead and actually do

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.929 
recommend to go ahead and actually do
the<00:01:19.140> same<00:01:19.409> finger<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.909> least

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the same finger that you use at least

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.560 
the same finger that you use at least
the<00:01:21.270> most<00:01:21.650> many<00:01:22.650> many<00:01:23.100> many<00:01:23.400> times<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.330> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the most many many many times maybe like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.480 
the most many many many times maybe like
three<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:24.960> four<00:01:24.990> times<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.070> calls

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
three or four times so it actually calls

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.070 
three or four times so it actually calls
it<00:01:26.640> three<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:26.850> four<00:01:27.030> different<00:01:27.150> fingers<00:01:27.600> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it three or four different fingers but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
it three or four different fingers but
really<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> same<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> reason<00:01:29.460> for

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
really it's the same and the reason for

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.510 
really it's the same and the reason for
that<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.299> accuracy<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.340> want

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that is just accuracy is that you want

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
that is just accuracy is that you want
to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.729> sure<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to make sure that this thing is going to

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
to make sure that this thing is going to
get<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.460> almost<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.820> 71<00:01:36.509> percent

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
get it so I'm almost there 71 percent

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
get it so I'm almost there 71 percent
seventy-three<00:01:37.710> percent<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> want

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
seventy-three percent you kind of want

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
seventy-three percent you kind of want
to<00:01:39.659> move<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.409> around<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.009> can

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
to move it a little bit around so it can

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039 
to move it a little bit around so it can
get<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.520> reading<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.030> finger<00:01:42.479> not

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
get a good reading on your finger not

for a passcode that you're going to set
up<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.740> process<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.970> there's<00:02:42.210> still<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
up in this process so there's still the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.660 
up in this process so there's still the
way<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> convenience<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.460> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
way in but the convenience of this is
