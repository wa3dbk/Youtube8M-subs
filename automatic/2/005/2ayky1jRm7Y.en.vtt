protective case when I'm not using it so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
protective case when I'm not using it so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.510 
I thought I would try a folio case
because<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> haven't<00:00:38.070> had<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:39.300> Google<00:00:39.899> brand

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
because I haven't had a Google brand

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.229 
because I haven't had a Google brand
case<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.930> Nexus<00:00:43.320> 7<00:00:43.350> yet<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.309> we'll<00:00:45.120> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
case for my my Nexus 7 yet so we'll just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
case for my my Nexus 7 yet so we'll just
slide<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> box<00:00:46.020> first<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:47.070> when

slide it out of the box first thing when

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.810

I<00:00:47.280> opened<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.890> shipping<00:00:50.280> box<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I opened this the the shipping box that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.770 
I opened this the the shipping box that
this<00:00:50.940> came<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> smell<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.300> case<00:00:54.539> was

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
overwhelming now I'm I'm sure it has

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.130 
overwhelming now I'm I'm sure it has
something<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> material<00:00:58.109> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
something to do with the material that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.729 
something to do with the material that
it's<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.829> made<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.359> was

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
it's that it's made out of it was

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.910 
it's that it's made out of it was
extremely<00:01:01.739> strong<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:04.320> taken<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
extremely strong and it it's taken a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
extremely strong and it it's taken a
couple<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.400> days<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> smell<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.630> away

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
couple of days for the smell to go away

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.250 
couple of days for the smell to go away
and<00:01:07.170> even<00:01:07.860> now<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.820> still<00:01:09.180> has<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> smell<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and even now it still has a smell to it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.940

I<00:02:08.069> found<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.030> cases<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:10.220> are<00:02:11.220> kind<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
I found that cases like this are kind of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
I found that cases like this are kind of
a<00:02:11.730> pain<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.000> use<00:02:12.599> one<00:02:12.900> hand

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
a pain to use one hand

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.369 
a pain to use one hand
did<00:02:13.519> because<00:02:14.519> when<00:02:14.730> you're<00:02:14.879> gripping<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
did because when you're gripping it the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.920 
did because when you're gripping it the
case<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.459> gets<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.790> little<00:02:17.879> older<00:02:18.420> tends<00:02:18.719> to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
case as it gets a little older tends to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.830 
case as it gets a little older tends to
kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.200> roll<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.310> back

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
kind of roll up on you in the back

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
kind of roll up on you in the back
however<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.109> case<00:02:22.349> does<00:02:22.769> have<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:24.150> little

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
however this case does have this little

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.220 
however this case does have this little
flap<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:25.049> here<00:02:25.079> which<00:02:25.439> allows<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.219> tuck

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
flap right here which allows you to tuck

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.559 
flap right here which allows you to tuck
the<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.950> front<00:02:29.189> flap<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.730> case<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.299> in

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the the front flap of the case and in

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.780 
the the front flap of the case and in
place<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.099> grip<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.549> like<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
place and then you can grip it like a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.630 
place and then you can grip it like a
book<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.260> works<00:02:34.500> pretty<00:02:34.620> well<00:02:34.920> we'll<00:02:35.459> see

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
book so that works pretty well we'll see

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.429 
book so that works pretty well we'll see
how<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.970> holds<00:02:36.299> up<00:02:36.390> over<00:02:36.689> time<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
how it holds up over time with this

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.740 
how it holds up over time with this
little<00:02:37.680> flap<00:02:38.069> as<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.239> kind<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.629> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
little flap as it is just kind of a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.559 
little flap as it is just kind of a
stitched<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:41.099> little<00:02:41.670> flap<00:02:41.939> and<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
stitched in a little flap and and that

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.750 
stitched in a little flap and and that
could<00:02:42.840> become<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.859> know<00:02:43.980> loose<00:02:44.310> over<00:02:44.579> time

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
could become you know loose over time

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.839 
could become you know loose over time
and<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.629> lose<00:02:45.870> functionality<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:46.889> for<00:02:47.730> me

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
and and lose functionality but for me

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.210 
and and lose functionality but for me
this<00:02:48.060> worked<00:02:48.329> out<00:02:48.510> pretty<00:02:48.840> good<00:02:49.139> as<00:02:49.349> long<00:02:49.889> as<00:02:50.069> I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
this worked out pretty good as long as I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.690 
this worked out pretty good as long as I
was<00:02:50.400> holding<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:51.030> like<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.540> book<00:02:51.950> if<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.189> was<00:02:53.430> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
was holding it like a book if I was you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.490 
was holding it like a book if I was you
know<00:02:53.819> laying<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.239> bed<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.750> kind<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.109> holding

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
know laying in bed and kind of holding

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.309 
know laying in bed and kind of holding
holding<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.159> in<00:02:56.250> an<00:02:56.370> angle<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:57.989> tend<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
holding it in an angle it would tend to

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.800 
holding it in an angle it would tend to
slip<00:02:58.680> out<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.400> little<00:02:59.790> of<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.480> little

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
slip out of this little of this little

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.319 
slip out of this little of this little
clasp<00:03:01.430> which<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.909> know<00:03:03.030> if<00:03:03.180> you're<00:03:03.299> not

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
clasp which you know if you're not

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.390 
clasp which you know if you're not
holding<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> your<00:03:04.109> your<00:03:04.709> device<00:03:05.069> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
holding on to your your device and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.309 
holding on to your your device and
you're<00:03:05.760> laying<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.120> you're<00:03:06.750> you're<00:03:07.079> bound

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
you're laying down you're you're bound

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.339 
you're laying down you're you're bound
to<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.220> land<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.669> your<00:03:08.790> face<00:03:09.349> luckily

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
to have it land on your face luckily

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.059 
to have it land on your face luckily
that<00:03:10.500> didn't<00:03:10.739> happen<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.159> so<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.480> also

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
that didn't happen to me so it also

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.000 
that didn't happen to me so it also
works<00:03:14.069> as<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> stand<00:03:15.139> so<00:03:16.139> your<00:03:16.260> device<00:03:16.500> stands

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
works as a stand so your device stands

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.039 
works as a stand so your device stands
up<00:03:17.159> really<00:03:17.909> well<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.329> isn't<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.629> new<00:03:18.810> feature

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
up really well this isn't a new feature

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.159 
up really well this isn't a new feature
or<00:03:19.229> anything<00:03:19.709> for<00:03:20.220> this<00:03:20.310> type<00:03:20.549> of<00:03:20.579> case

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
or anything for this type of case

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.809 
or anything for this type of case
however<00:03:22.169> it<00:03:22.379> is<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> nice<00:03:22.769> viewing<00:03:23.129> angle<00:03:23.609> it's

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
however it is a nice viewing angle it's

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.180 
however it is a nice viewing angle it's
kind<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.060> hard<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.269> see<00:03:24.479> in<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> camera<00:03:25.079> here

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
kind of hard to see in the camera here

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.819 
kind of hard to see in the camera here
so<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:27.090> far<00:03:27.269> as<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.419> multi-function<00:03:28.319> case<00:03:28.530> goes

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
so as far as a multi-function case goes

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.680 
so as far as a multi-function case goes
it<00:03:29.069> works<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.489> well<00:03:29.609> doesn't<00:03:30.329> have<00:03:30.540> any

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
it works pretty well doesn't have any

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.539 
it works pretty well doesn't have any
pockets<00:03:30.959> or<00:03:31.349> anything<00:03:31.409> like<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:31.889> it's<00:03:32.430> just

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
pockets or anything like that it's just

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.089 
pockets or anything like that it's just
simply<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> case<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:34.049> covers<00:03:34.409> both<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> front

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
simply a case that covers both the front

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.599 
simply a case that covers both the front
and<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:35.549> of<00:03:35.579> your<00:03:35.879> device<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.459> does

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
and back of your device and and it does

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.180 
and back of your device and and it does
a<00:03:38.639> great<00:03:38.819> job<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.780> think<00:03:40.229> the<00:03:40.680> price<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.159> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
a great job so I think the price is a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.219 
a great job so I think the price is a
little<00:03:41.370> high<00:03:41.669> for<00:03:41.699> this<00:03:42.209> case<00:03:42.479> considering

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
little high for this case considering

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.259 
little high for this case considering
that<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:43.979> find<00:03:44.220> cases<00:03:44.669> like<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:45.090> all

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
that you can find cases like this all

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.129 
that you can find cases like this all
day<00:03:45.299> long<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.900> Amazon<00:03:46.409> for<00:03:46.909> less<00:03:47.909> than<00:03:48.090> $20<00:03:48.810> but

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
day long on Amazon for less than $20 but

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.409 
day long on Amazon for less than $20 but
the<00:03:49.799> quality<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.310> pretty<00:03:50.699> good<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.329> only

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
the quality is pretty good the only

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.509 
the quality is pretty good the only
thing<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.959> think<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.739> lacking<00:03:53.099> in<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
thing that I think is lacking in the

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.550 
thing that I think is lacking in the
quality<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.209> when<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.750> pay<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.169> kind<00:03:55.500> of

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
quality is when you pay for that kind of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.099 
quality is when you pay for that kind of
a<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.150> price<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.479> a<00:03:57.540> case

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
a that price for a case

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.869 
a that price for a case
you<00:03:58.439> shouldn't<00:03:58.769> have<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:59.129> let<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.430> case<00:03:59.639> air

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879
