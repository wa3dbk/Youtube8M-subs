00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
that and then also hear what you say
about<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.680> whole<00:01:34.829> division<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.400> how<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> get

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
about the whole division and how to get

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.569 
about the whole division and how to get
athletes<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.960> involved<00:01:37.439> first<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
athletes more involved first I think the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460 
athletes more involved first I think the
name<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> great<00:01:39.270> name<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> there's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
name is a great name you know there's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990 
name is a great name you know there's
always<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
always that people don't want to be

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
always that people don't want to be
labeled<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.390> disabled<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.110> handicapped<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.799> I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
labeled as disabled or handicapped so I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.420 
labeled as disabled or handicapped so I
think<00:01:43.979> calling<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> adaptive<00:01:45.240> athlete

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
think calling it the adaptive athlete

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.730 
think calling it the adaptive athlete
classic<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> great<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> put<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
classic is a great way to put it and I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
classic is a great way to put it and I
think<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.220> idea<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:51.030> general<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
think the idea in general for the for

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.350 
think the idea in general for the for
the<00:01:52.049> competition<00:01:52.340> including<00:01:53.340> us<00:01:53.460> giving
