hey<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.140> Alan<00:00:01.380> over<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.620> Sonic

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hey guys this is Alan over at Sonic

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.929 
hey guys this is Alan over at Sonic
Electronix<00:00:01.979> today<00:00:02.550> I'm<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:02.909> you

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
Electronix today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.700 
Electronix today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> adjust<00:00:03.870> your<00:00:04.140> gain<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.560> your

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
how to adjust your gain on your

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
how to adjust your gain on your
amplifier<00:00:05.160> using<00:00:05.430> an<00:00:05.640> oscilloscope<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.870> we

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
amplifier using an oscilloscope so we

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.600 
amplifier using an oscilloscope so we
already<00:00:07.259> have<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.500> oscilloscope<00:00:07.919> connected

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
already have the oscilloscope connected

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.290 
already have the oscilloscope connected
here<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.080> leads<00:00:11.150> off<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
here we have the leads off the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.180 
here we have the leads off the
oscilloscope<00:00:12.719> clamped<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> output<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
oscilloscope clamped on to the output of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
oscilloscope clamped on to the output of
the<00:00:14.370> amplifier<00:00:14.570> we<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.780> playing<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.170> 40<00:00:16.529> hurt

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the amplifier we are playing a 40 hurt

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680 
the amplifier we are playing a 40 hurt
test<00:00:16.980> tone<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.880> basically<00:00:18.240> all<00:00:18.359> I'm<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
test tone so basically all I'm going to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.150 
test tone so basically all I'm going to
do<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> start<00:00:19.140> creeping<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.740> gain<00:00:19.980> on

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
do is start creeping up this gain on

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.519 
do is start creeping up this gain on
this<00:00:20.279> amplifier<00:00:20.750> as<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.050> see<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.380> gain

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this amplifier as you can see the gain

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.290 
this amplifier as you can see the gain
is<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.130> currently<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.000> radio

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
is all the way down currently the radio

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.550 
is all the way down currently the radio
has<00:00:24.420> already<00:00:24.660> turned<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.990> three-quarters<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
has already turned up three-quarters of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
has already turned up three-quarters of
the<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> nice<00:00:26.880> smooth

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the way you see we have a nice smooth

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.050 
the way you see we have a nice smooth
sound<00:00:27.420> sine<00:00:28.050> wave<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.789> I'm<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> go

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
sound sine wave and I'm going to go

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060 
sound sine wave and I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.269> start<00:00:30.449> turning<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> gain<00:00:31.859> on

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
ahead and start turning up the gain on

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.250 
ahead and start turning up the gain on
the<00:00:32.189> amplifier<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.079> what

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the amplifier and so you can see what

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.110 
the amplifier and so you can see what
happens<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> screen<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:37.760> so<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.940> we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
happens on the screen here so as we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
happens on the screen here so as we
creep<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> amplifier<00:00:40.140> gain<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.710> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
creep up the amplifier gain you can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
creep up the amplifier gain you can
still<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> nice<00:00:41.879> smooth

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
still see that we have a nice smooth

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.140 
still see that we have a nice smooth
sine<00:00:42.510> wave<00:00:43.430> as<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> keep<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.210> up

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
sine wave as you keep going up

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.990 
sine wave as you keep going up
you'll<00:00:47.720> start<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.230> see<00:00:48.550> right<00:00:49.550> there<00:00:49.790> at<00:00:49.940> that

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
you'll start to see right there at that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.150 
you'll start to see right there at that
point<00:00:50.150> we<00:00:51.050> have<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.200> little<00:00:51.440> bit<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.740> a<00:00:51.830> square

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
point we have a little bit of a square

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.680 
point we have a little bit of a square
off<00:00:52.400> at<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.700> top<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.150> bottom<00:00:53.450> of<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
off at the top and the bottom of the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.620 
off at the top and the bottom of the
sine<00:00:53.900> wave<00:00:53.930> there<00:00:54.380> as<00:00:54.560> you<00:00:55.160> keep<00:00:55.340> going<00:00:55.520> up<00:00:55.850> it

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
sine wave there as you keep going up it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.210 
sine wave there as you keep going up it
gets<00:00:56.780> worse<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.470> gets<00:00:57.560> worse<00:00:57.830> and<00:00:58.160> that's

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
gets worse it gets worse and that's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.280 
gets worse it gets worse and that's
really<00:00:58.820> bad<00:00:59.000> distortion<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.870> that's<00:00:59.990> what

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
really bad distortion and that's what

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.100 
really bad distortion and that's what
makes<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.340> not<00:01:01.730> sound<00:01:02.060> good<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.960> that's

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
makes is not sound good and you that's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.170 
makes is not sound good and you that's
where<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.410> blow<00:01:03.560> speakers<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.280> woofers<00:01:04.580> etc

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
where you blow speakers and woofers etc

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.000 
where you blow speakers and woofers etc
so<00:01:05.780> not<00:01:06.050> only<00:01:06.290> would<00:01:06.410> you<00:01:06.440> want<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.740> do<00:01:06.830> this

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
so not only would you want to do this

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.830 
so not only would you want to do this
for<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:07.580> sub<00:01:07.880> amplifier<00:01:08.360> you'd<00:01:08.540> want<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.780> do

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
for your sub amplifier you'd want to do

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.900 
for your sub amplifier you'd want to do
this<00:01:08.990> for<00:01:09.170> your<00:01:09.260> mids<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.560> highs<00:01:09.650> as<00:01:09.950> well<00:01:10.100> so

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
this for your mids and highs as well so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.160 
this for your mids and highs as well so
we're<00:01:11.120> gonna<00:01:11.210> go<00:01:11.330> ahead<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.510> do<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.750> back<00:01:11.990> this

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
we're gonna go ahead and do is back this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.960 
we're gonna go ahead and do is back this
down<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:13.720> right<00:01:14.720> there<00:01:15.460> we've<00:01:16.460> got<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.700> nice

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
down and right there we've got a nice

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.380 
down and right there we've got a nice
smooth<00:01:17.420> clean<00:01:17.780> sine<00:01:18.140> wave<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.030> we<00:01:20.030> have<00:01:20.180> no

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
smooth clean sine wave and we have no

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.820 
smooth clean sine wave and we have no
distortion<00:01:20.930> there<00:01:21.050> there's<00:01:21.260> many<00:01:21.470> many<00:01:21.680> other

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
distortion there there's many many other

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.830 
distortion there there's many many other
things<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.490> can<00:01:22.640> do<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.970> really<00:01:23.240> really<00:01:23.540> tweak

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
things you can do to really really tweak

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.290 
things you can do to really really tweak
this<00:01:24.050> thing<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:24.410> get<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.650> even<00:01:25.119> tweaked<00:01:26.119> in

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
this thing and get it even tweaked in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.609 
this thing and get it even tweaked in
further<00:01:26.600> than<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:26.960> we're<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.229> showing<00:01:27.410> you

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
further than what we're just showing you

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.230 
further than what we're just showing you
here<00:01:27.800> but<00:01:28.280> just<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.580> kind<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.820> give<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.150> an

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
here but just to kind of give you an

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.070 
here but just to kind of give you an
idea<00:01:29.360> of<00:01:29.990> what<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.680> distortion<00:01:31.250> looks<00:01:31.490> like

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
idea of what that distortion looks like

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.350 
idea of what that distortion looks like
