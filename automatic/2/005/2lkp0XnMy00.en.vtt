00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.360 
preferences to the delay ten seconds
could<00:03:50.040> have<00:03:50.160> 10<00:03:50.519> or<00:03:51.500> I'll<00:03:52.500> show<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.889> what<00:03:53.010> five

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
could have 10 or I'll show you what five

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.879 
could have 10 or I'll show you what five
looks<00:03:53.609> like<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:56.130> i'll<00:03:56.970> show<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.269> again<00:03:57.989> so

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
looks like and i'll show you again so

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:08.820 
looks like and i'll show you again so
i'm<00:03:58.950> going<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.190> put<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.579> one

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.810 

so<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:10.210> is<00:04:10.650> what<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.770> looks<00:04:11.950> like<00:04:12.130> now<00:04:12.640> this

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
so this is what it looks like now this

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.160 
so this is what it looks like now this
is<00:04:12.880> 10<00:04:13.300> seconds<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:15.280> number<00:04:16.060> instead<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.870> five

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
is 10 seconds the number instead of five

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.690 
is 10 seconds the number instead of five
this<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.590> 10<00:04:17.860> so<00:04:18.850> it's<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.030> little<00:04:19.180> bit<00:04:19.299> slower

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
this is 10 so it's a little bit slower

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.820 
this is 10 so it's a little bit slower
then<00:04:21.700> five<00:04:22.320> now<00:04:23.320> i'm<00:04:23.470> going<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.620> right<00:04:23.800> click

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
that's how you do that on if you really

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
that's how you do that on if you really
make<00:06:05.170> a<00:06:05.200> sweet<00:06:05.770> image<00:06:06.730> or<00:06:06.940> whatever<00:06:07.740> you<00:06:08.740> could
