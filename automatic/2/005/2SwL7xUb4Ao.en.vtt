is that really yeah I think it might be
no<00:02:46.659> it's<00:02:46.810> two<00:02:46.959> liters<00:02:48.150> I'm<00:02:49.150> scared<00:02:50.879> all<00:02:51.879> right

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.010 
I think we definitely tested the gear to
its<00:03:11.800> limit<00:03:14.040> yeah<00:03:15.300> he's<00:03:16.300> not<00:03:16.510> gonna<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.840> very

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
engines still working the pack that

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.539 
engines still working the pack that
we've<00:04:17.080> thrown<00:04:17.290> out<00:04:17.560> of<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.830> truck<00:04:18.310> at<00:04:18.459> a

now<00:04:20.200> as<00:04:21.100> we<00:04:21.280> tested<00:04:22.030> all<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.360> zippers<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
now as we tested all of the zippers and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.850 
now as we tested all of the zippers and
everything<00:04:23.290> you're<00:04:23.410> in<00:04:23.500> good<00:04:23.650> repair

tosses<00:04:36.610> out<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.790> truck<00:04:36.970> now<00:04:37.150> what<00:04:37.630> we<00:04:37.750> really

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
tosses out the truck now what we really

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.390 
tosses out the truck now what we really
want<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.200> look<00:04:38.350> at<00:04:38.500> here<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.919> how<00:04:39.070> well<00:04:39.280> the

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
want to look at here is how well the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.190 
want to look at here is how well the
hydration<00:04:39.940> engine<00:04:40.090> did<00:04:40.390> so<00:04:40.960> we're<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.140> to

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
hydration engine did so we're going to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.130 
hydration engine did so we're going to
take<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.470> engine<00:04:41.590> out<00:04:41.830> of<00:04:41.979> this<00:04:42.100> pack<00:04:42.370> and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
take the engine out of this pack and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.409 
take the engine out of this pack and
disconnect<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.290> tubes<00:04:45.150> those<00:04:46.150> look<00:04:46.390> like

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
disconnect the tubes those look like

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.180 
disconnect the tubes those look like
they<00:04:46.750> handle<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.260> hundred<00:04:47.890> mile<00:04:47.979> an<00:04:48.160> hour

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
they handle the hundred mile an hour

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.610 
they handle the hundred mile an hour
impacts<00:04:49.000> really<00:04:49.210> well<00:04:49.450> now<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:50.290> can<00:04:50.440> fill

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
impacts really well now you you can fill

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.170 
impacts really well now you you can fill
up<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.950> body<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> water<00:04:51.310> like<00:04:51.640> this<00:04:51.700> with<00:04:52.150> a

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
up in a body of water like this with a

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.030 
up in a body of water like this with a
geigerrig<00:04:52.570> because<00:04:52.960> we've<00:04:53.140> got<00:04:53.320> those<00:04:53.470> inline

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
geigerrig because we've got those inline

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.620 
geigerrig because we've got those inline
filters<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.640> plug<00:04:54.820> into<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.120> drinking<00:04:55.419> tube

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
filters that plug into the drinking tube

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.300 
filters that plug into the drinking tube
and<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:55.990> drink<00:04:56.200> we're<00:04:56.919> going<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.100> test

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and you can drink we're going to test

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.640 
and you can drink we're going to test
this<00:04:57.430> for<00:04:57.490> leakage<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.360> see<00:04:58.570> how<00:04:58.690> well<00:04:58.900> this

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
this for leakage and see how well this

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.610 
this for leakage and see how well this
pack<00:04:59.919> did

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
pack did

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.070 
pack did
fill<00:05:02.620> up<00:05:02.710> our<00:05:02.860> hydration<00:05:03.639> pack<00:05:05.580> easy<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.819> do

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
fill up our hydration pack easy to do

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.140 
fill up our hydration pack easy to do
put<00:05:08.080> our<00:05:08.169> slide<00:05:08.409> top<00:05:08.680> back<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.069> which<00:05:09.249> got

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
put our slide top back on which got

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.269 
put our slide top back on which got
pounded<00:05:10.599> off<00:05:10.749> when<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.050> hit<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.409> concrete<00:05:11.860> at<00:05:12.219> a

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
pounded off when I hit the concrete at a

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.850 
pounded off when I hit the concrete at a
hundred<00:05:12.460> miles<00:05:12.729> an<00:05:12.879> hour<00:05:12.999> run<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.050> test<00:05:14.620> for

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
hundred miles an hour run a test for

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.369 
hundred miles an hour run a test for
leakage<00:05:15.360> trying<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.449> dry<00:05:16.629> it<00:05:16.689> off<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.139> we<00:05:17.229> can

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
leakage trying to dry it off so we can

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:23.040 
leakage trying to dry it off so we can
see<00:05:17.409> we<00:05:17.949> got<00:05:18.069> anything<00:05:18.309> going<00:05:18.639> on<00:05:21.569> no<00:05:22.569> leakage

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
see we got anything going on no leakage

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.869 
see we got anything going on no leakage
all<00:05:23.319> the<00:05:23.439> seams<00:05:23.710> seem<00:05:24.009> to<00:05:24.099> handle<00:05:24.279> the<00:05:24.520> impact

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
all the seams seem to handle the impact

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.149 
all the seams seem to handle the impact
of<00:05:25.089> 100<00:05:25.419> miles<00:05:25.539> an<00:05:25.749> hour<00:05:25.839> pretty<00:05:26.139> well<00:05:26.319> now

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
of 100 miles an hour pretty well now

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.649 
of 100 miles an hour pretty well now
let's<00:05:27.370> plug<00:05:27.550> it<00:05:27.699> into<00:05:27.819> the<00:05:27.939> pack<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.419> see<00:05:28.569> how

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
let's plug it into the pack and see how

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.579 
let's plug it into the pack and see how
we<00:05:28.719> did<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.259> I'm<00:05:30.039> gonna<00:05:30.129> hook<00:05:30.339> in<00:05:30.520> our

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
we did so I'm gonna hook in our

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.889 
we did so I'm gonna hook in our
pressurization<00:05:32.589> tube<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:34.509> all<00:05:34.629> of<00:05:34.779> the

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
pressurization tube and all of the

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.589 
pressurization tube and all of the
Evolve<00:05:35.199> seem<00:05:35.529> to<00:05:35.649> be<00:05:35.740> working<00:05:36.039> just<00:05:36.069> great

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
Evolve seem to be working just great

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.730 
Evolve seem to be working just great
we'll<00:05:37.599> just<00:05:37.749> do<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:37.990> out<00:05:38.199> in<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.349> open<00:05:38.379> so

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
we'll just do this out in the open so

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.790 
we'll just do this out in the open so
you<00:05:38.800> can<00:05:38.919> see<00:05:39.099> the<00:05:39.219> valve<00:05:39.399> work<00:05:39.870> go<00:05:40.870> I'm<00:05:41.649> gonna

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
you can see the valve work go I'm gonna

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.549 
you can see the valve work go I'm gonna
pressurize<00:05:42.219> this<00:05:42.990> really<00:05:43.990> quick

00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:44.559 
pressurize this really quick

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:46.589 
pressurize this really quick
you<00:05:45.069> can<00:05:45.219> see<00:05:45.399> all<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.669> pressurization

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
you can see all the pressurization

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.809 
you can see all the pressurization
videos<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.409> things<00:05:47.589> that<00:05:47.680> we've<00:05:47.860> done<00:05:48.039> it

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
videos and things that we've done it

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.879 
videos and things that we've done it
seems<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.360> be<00:05:49.449> holding<00:05:49.749> it<00:05:49.870> at<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.349> pressure

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
seems to be holding it at the pressure

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.950 
seems to be holding it at the pressure
really<00:05:51.129> wet<00:05:51.339> good<00:05:51.729> will<00:05:52.059> pump<00:05:52.240> it<00:05:52.360> up<00:05:52.449> extra

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
really wet good will pump it up extra

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.409 
really wet good will pump it up extra
just<00:05:53.139> to<00:05:53.229> see<00:05:53.469> if<00:05:53.559> we<00:05:53.710> can<00:05:53.860> get<00:05:54.460> that<00:05:54.639> slide<00:05:55.149> top

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
just to see if we can get that slide top

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.760 
just to see if we can get that slide top
to<00:05:55.599> do<00:05:55.719> anything<00:05:56.050> crazy<00:05:58.139> slide<00:05:59.139> top<00:05:59.379> seems<00:05:59.649> to

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
to do anything crazy slide top seems to

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.159 
to do anything crazy slide top seems to
be<00:05:59.860> handling<00:06:00.279> pretty<00:06:00.930> handling<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.050> pretty

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
be handling pretty handling it pretty

we go
the<00:06:09.909> geigerrig<00:06:10.270> hydration<00:06:10.389> engine<00:06:10.990> is

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
the geigerrig hydration engine is

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.309 
the geigerrig hydration engine is
functioning<00:06:11.560> beautifully<00:06:12.520> after<00:06:12.819> two<00:06:13.319> 100
