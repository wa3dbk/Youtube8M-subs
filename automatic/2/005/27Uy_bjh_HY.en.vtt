every time you keep lighting precision

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.830 
every time you keep lighting precision
shots<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.939> automatically<00:01:50.939> fills<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.600> clip

probably<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> best<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:16.200> really<00:02:16.500> did

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
probably the best I really really did

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.390

like<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.840> Icebreaker<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.980> seriously

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
like the the Icebreaker but I seriously

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
like the the Icebreaker but I seriously
think<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> new<00:02:21.510> favorite<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.050> mine

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
think this is a new favorite of mine

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.470 
think this is a new favorite of mine
also<00:02:22.890> because<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> legendary<00:02:23.940> takes<00:02:24.300> up

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
also because it is a legendary takes up

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.690 
also because it is a legendary takes up
that<00:02:24.600> legendary<00:02:25.140> doesn't<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.460> be<00:02:26.580> an

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that legendary doesn't have to be an

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.150 
that legendary doesn't have to be an
exotic<00:02:27.270> doesn't<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> take<00:02:28.500> up<00:02:28.620> an<00:02:28.710> exotic

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
exotic doesn't have to take up an exotic
