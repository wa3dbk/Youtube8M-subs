of the amp but just to give you an
example<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.600> literally<00:01:28.439> assign<00:01:29.430> almost

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
example you can literally assign almost

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
example you can literally assign almost
every<00:01:30.750> parameter<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.240> gr-55<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
every parameter on the gr-55 to the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.010 
every parameter on the gr-55 to the
pedal<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:36.030> could<00:01:36.240> scroll<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.630> scroll<00:01:36.840> here

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
pedal and I could scroll and scroll here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
pedal and I could scroll and scroll here
for<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.500> long<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.369> what<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
for a very long time but what I want to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.999 
for a very long time but what I want to
assign<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.829> amplifier<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
assign is the amplifier and I want to

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
assign is the amplifier and I want to
assign<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.700> gain<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:46.079> much<00:01:46.259> dirt<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:48.079> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
assign the gain how much dirt so the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.469 
assign the gain how much dirt so the
next<00:01:49.470> parameter<00:01:49.649> down<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.220> target<00:01:50.970> minimum<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
next parameter down is target minimum so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
next parameter down is target minimum so
in<00:01:51.570> other<00:01:51.630> words<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.049> pedal<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> all<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
in other words when the pedal is all the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
in other words when the pedal is all the
way<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:52.860> how<00:01:53.640> much<00:01:53.790> gain<00:01:54.000> am<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> have

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
way up how much gain am I going to have

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.649 
way up how much gain am I going to have
well<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.770> zero<00:01:56.240> I'm<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.540> going

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
well if I have it at zero I'm not going

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690 
well if I have it at zero I'm not going

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
to have any sound so on this particular
app<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> start<00:02:01.530> adjusting

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
app I'm just going to start adjusting

app I'm just going to start adjusting
and<00:02:02.310> let's<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> end<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.530> with

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and let's just see what I end up with

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.960 
and let's just see what I end up with
here<00:02:05.780> as<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.099> get<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> third

I'm going to put it around let's say 25

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.390 
I'm going to put it around let's say 25
is<00:02:12.390> where<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> had<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.710> when<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> pedals<00:02:14.220> up

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
is where I had it so when the pedals up

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
is where I had it so when the pedals up
I<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.150> pretty<00:02:15.450> clean<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.710> push

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I got it's pretty clean now when I push

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
I got it's pretty clean now when I push
the<00:02:17.100> pedal<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.460> how<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.240> dirt<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.780> want

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
the pedal down how much dirt do I want

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.990 
the pedal down how much dirt do I want
well<00:02:19.200> 120<00:02:19.860> would<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> gain<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.760> wide<00:02:20.970> open

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
well 120 would be the gain is wide open

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540 
well 120 would be the gain is wide open
I<00:02:21.570> don't<00:02:21.780> want<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.260> much<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.490> to

clean sweep all the way through if I use

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.699 
clean sweep all the way through if I use
the<00:03:05.790> control<00:03:06.209> pedal<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:07.170> just<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> go

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
the control pedal it's just going to go

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.750 
the control pedal it's just going to go
from<00:03:07.950> 25<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.610> 60<00:03:08.970> 25<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.660> 60<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> hit<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
from 25 to 60 25 to 60 when I hit it and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.660 
from 25 to 60 25 to 60 when I hit it and
then<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.239> next<00:03:12.630> parameter<00:03:13.590> down<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.100> if<00:03:14.280> you

then the next parameter down is if you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.690 
then the next parameter down is if you
want<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.940> momentary<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.860> real-time<00:03:17.130> or<00:03:17.640> do

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
want it momentary so in real-time or do

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880 
want it momentary so in real-time or do
you<00:03:17.760> want<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.209> latch<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.440> that's<00:03:19.650> or

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
you want it to latch and that's or

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.259 
you want it to latch and that's or
toggle<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.640> that's<00:03:20.790> where<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
toggle and that's where it's going to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.150 
toggle and that's where it's going to
again<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.050> would<00:03:22.200> use<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.410> more<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
again it you would use that more for the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.550 
again it you would use that more for the
control<00:03:23.580> pedal<00:03:24.030> where<00:03:24.420> it'll<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.989> going

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
control pedal where it'll be like going

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
control pedal where it'll be like going
on<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.220> off<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.000> case<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.540> want<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
on and off in this case we want it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.960 
on and off in this case we want it
momentary<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> go<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> way<00:03:28.709> through<00:03:28.980> now

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
momentary to go all the way through now

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.150 
momentary to go all the way through now
the<00:03:30.030> next<00:03:30.780> parameter<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.440> one<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.830> lot<00:03:31.950> of

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
simple it's just actually where do you

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.850 
simple it's just actually where do you
want<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.360> take<00:03:36.540> place<00:03:36.570> do<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.590> want<00:03:37.769> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
want this to take place do you want it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.380 
want this to take place do you want it
to<00:03:38.010> go<00:03:38.130> from<00:03:38.370> 25<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.150> 60<00:03:40.310> all<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.910> way<00:03:42.030> through

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.420 
it's 25 when it's all the way down it's
60<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.570> that's<00:03:48.780> indeed<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.470> want<00:03:50.100> just

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
60 and that's indeed what we want just

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.199 
60 and that's indeed what we want just
think<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.420> pedal<00:03:51.750> has<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:53.100> control<00:03:53.970> range

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
think of this pedal has a control range

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.360 
think of this pedal has a control range
up<00:03:54.420> from<00:03:54.630> 0<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.049> 127<00:03:55.560> we're<00:03:56.010> going<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.220> show<00:03:56.340> you

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
up from 0 to 127 we're going to show you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.039 
up from 0 to 127 we're going to show you
another<00:03:56.549> use<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.269> later<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:57.900> you

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
another use for that later on so if you

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.990 
another use for that later on so if you
not<00:03:58.200> don't<00:03:58.590> quite<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.040> it<00:03:59.100> right<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.549> you

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
not don't quite get it right now you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390 
not don't quite get it right now you
will<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.600> that's<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.440> you're<00:04:01.709> done<00:04:01.739> you've

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
will and that's it you're done you've

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.270 
will and that's it you're done you've
now<00:04:02.700> assigned<00:04:03.150> your<00:04:03.570> amp<00:04:03.780> gain

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
now assigned your amp gain

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.780 
now assigned your amp gain
to<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.030> expression<00:04:06.420> panel<00:04:07.050> boom<00:04:07.790> assign

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
to this expression panel boom assign

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.340 
to this expression panel boom assign
number<00:04:09.300> one

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.740 

all<00:04:13.310> right<00:04:13.490> so<00:04:13.640> that's<00:04:13.790> one<00:04:14.120> assign<00:04:14.450> let's

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
all right so that's one assign let's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.690 
all right so that's one assign let's
have<00:04:14.930> some<00:04:15.140> more<00:04:15.320> fun<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.830> assign<00:04:16.370> something

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
have some more fun and assign something

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.970 
have some more fun and assign something
else<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.300> expression<00:04:17.840> pedal<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.800> we're

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
else to the expression pedal so we're

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.949 
else to the expression pedal so we're
already<00:04:19.520> on<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.880> assigned<00:04:20.420> page<00:04:20.690> but

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
already on the assigned page but

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.660 
already on the assigned page but
remember<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:21.380> assigned<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.070> gain<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.580> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
remember we assigned the gain of the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.200 
remember we assigned the gain of the
amplifier<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:23.990> go<00:04:24.170> page<00:04:24.650> over<00:04:25.520> here<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.940> now

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
amplifier if I go page over here I now

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.570 
amplifier if I go page over here I now
get<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.510> my<00:04:26.690> second<00:04:27.200> assign<00:04:27.560> in<00:04:27.830> this<00:04:28.310> case

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
get to my second assign in this case

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.150 
get to my second assign in this case
check<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.270> out<00:04:29.390> now<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.110> amp<00:04:30.380> level

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
check it out now this is the amp level

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.520 
check it out now this is the amp level
that<00:04:31.340> I've<00:04:31.490> assigned<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.300> pedal<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:33.260> not

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
that I've assigned to the pedal so not

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.310 
that I've assigned to the pedal so not
only<00:04:33.890> as<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.250> push<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.490> pedal<00:04:34.940> down<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.630> it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
only as I push the pedal down is it

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.200 
only as I push the pedal down is it
going<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.710> get<00:04:36.830> dirtier<00:04:37.310> but<00:04:37.490> I'm<00:04:37.610> also

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
going to get dirtier but I'm also

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.270 
going to get dirtier but I'm also
increasing<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> master<00:04:39.410> level<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.160> is

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
increasing the master level so this is

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.070 
increasing the master level so this is
great<00:04:40.490> if<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.670> want<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.910> pop<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> solo<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.840> you

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
great if I want to pop a solo and you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.630 
great if I want to pop a solo and you
can<00:04:42.230> see<00:04:42.440> what<00:04:42.590> I've<00:04:42.710> got<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.040> set<00:04:43.310> here<00:04:43.460> let's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
can see what I've got it set here let's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.850 
can see what I've got it set here let's
have<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.850> look<00:04:44.060> at<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> parameters<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.470> when

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
have a look at the parameters so when

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.160 
have a look at the parameters so when
the<00:04:45.980> pedals<00:04:46.340> up<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:47.210> like<00:04:47.420> my<00:04:47.570> master<00:04:47.990> level

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
the pedals up it's like my master level

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.160 
the pedals up it's like my master level
is<00:04:48.440> at<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.620> hundred<00:04:49.390> when<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.420> push<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.870> pedal

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
is at a hundred when I push the pedal

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.750 
is at a hundred when I push the pedal
all<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.470> way<00:04:51.590> down<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:52.220> goes<00:04:52.490> up<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.730> a

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
all the way down it just goes up to a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.460 
all the way down it just goes up to a
hundred<00:04:52.970> it's<00:04:53.120> just<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.330> little<00:04:53.480> boost<00:04:53.750> that

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
hundred it's just a little boost that

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.890 
hundred it's just a little boost that
I'm<00:04:54.890> doing<00:04:55.160> on<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.400> amplifier<00:04:55.700> again<00:04:56.570> I'm

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
I'm doing on the amplifier again I'm

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.450 
I'm doing on the amplifier again I'm
using<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.410> expression<00:04:57.920> pedal<00:04:57.950> again

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
using the expression pedal again

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.730 
using the expression pedal again
momentary<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.240> again<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.750> range<00:05:00.050> is<00:05:00.410> from

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
momentary and again the range is from

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.230 
momentary and again the range is from
pedal<00:05:01.070> all<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.400> way<00:05:01.520> up<00:05:01.670> to<00:05:01.850> pedal<00:05:02.120> all<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
pedal all the way up to pedal all the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.330 
pedal all the way up to pedal all the
way<00:05:02.360> down<00:05:02.630> pretty<00:05:03.470> cool<00:05:03.710> so<00:05:03.980> I'm<00:05:04.100> going<00:05:04.310> to

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
way down pretty cool so I'm going to

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.150 
way down pretty cool so I'm going to
bring<00:05:05.210> up<00:05:05.330> my<00:05:05.450> level<00:05:05.660> let's<00:05:06.560> go<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.800> a<00:05:06.890> sign

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
bring up my level let's go to a sign

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.300 
bring up my level let's go to a sign
number<00:05:07.430> three<00:05:07.790> page<00:05:08.630> over<00:05:09.260> again<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:10.040> is

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
number three page over again this is

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.360 
number three page over again this is
neat<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.080> now<00:05:12.410> what<00:05:12.650> I<00:05:12.680> have<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:13.130> when<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
neat so now what I have is when the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.210 
neat so now what I have is when the
pedals<00:05:13.670> all<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.000> way<00:05:14.120> up<00:05:14.300> I've<00:05:15.080> got<00:05:15.410> the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
pedals all the way up I've got the

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.100 
pedals all the way up I've got the
chorus<00:05:16.670> is<00:05:16.850> on<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.450> let's<00:05:17.600> just<00:05:17.750> go<00:05:17.840> up<00:05:17.930> there

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
chorus is on so let's just go up there

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.100 
chorus is on so let's just go up there
so<00:05:18.320> my<00:05:18.470> target<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.070> chorus<00:05:19.490> level<00:05:20.120> with

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
so my target is the chorus level with

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.510 
so my target is the chorus level with
the<00:05:21.230> pedal<00:05:21.590> all<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.680> way<00:05:21.800> up<00:05:22.010> this<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
the pedal all the way up this is the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.070 
the pedal all the way up this is the
level<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:22.970> course<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:23.390> could<00:05:23.540> change<00:05:23.810> that

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
level of the course I could change that

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.110 
level of the course I could change that
and<00:05:24.350> make<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.070> know<00:05:25.190> whatever<00:05:25.430> but<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:25.850> like

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
and make it you know whatever but I like

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.000 
and make it you know whatever but I like
the<00:05:26.240> sound<00:05:26.480> of<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.630> chorus<00:05:26.960> where<00:05:27.590> it's<00:05:27.740> set

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
the sound of the chorus where it's set

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.529 
the sound of the chorus where it's set
there

like that but watch this that's when the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.730 
like that but watch this that's when the
pedals<00:05:36.330> up<00:05:36.509> the<00:05:36.689> level<00:05:37.020> is<00:05:37.379> at<00:05:38.180> 50<00:05:39.409> when<00:05:40.409> I<00:05:40.439> push

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
the pedal down it's going to shut it

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.939 
the pedal down it's going to shut it
right<00:05:42.569> off<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.930> want<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.229> level<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.560> go<00:05:43.650> all<00:05:43.860> the

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
right off I want the level to go all the

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.649 
right off I want the level to go all the
way<00:05:44.069> down<00:05:44.280> again<00:05:44.729> I'm<00:05:44.849> using<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.210> expression

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
way down again I'm using the expression

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.450 
way down again I'm using the expression
pedal<00:05:45.689> again<00:05:46.169> momentary<00:05:46.680> but<00:05:47.099> here's<00:05:47.310> the

pedal again momentary but here's the

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.399 
pedal again momentary but here's the
cool<00:05:47.699> thing<00:05:47.729> check<00:05:48.509> this<00:05:48.689> out<00:05:48.900> this<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.110> where

cool thing check this out this is where

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.740 
cool thing check this out this is where
this<00:05:49.560> active<00:05:50.039> range<00:05:50.280> comes<00:05:50.550> in<00:05:50.849> when<00:05:51.659> the

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
this active range comes in when the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
pedals all the way up it's going to be

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.809 
pedals all the way up it's going to be
at<00:05:53.909> 50<00:05:54.949> remember<00:05:55.949> I<00:05:55.979> told<00:05:56.069> you<00:05:56.310> this<00:05:56.490> pedal

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
at 50 remember I told you this pedal

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.980 
at 50 remember I told you this pedal
goes<00:05:56.969> from<00:05:57.240> 0<00:05:57.599> to<00:05:57.990> 127<00:05:58.610> well<00:05:59.610> if<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:00.629> push<00:06:00.870> it

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
goes from 0 to 127 well if I push it

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.469 
goes from 0 to 127 well if I push it
down<00:06:01.139> slightly<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.800> brings<00:06:02.069> it<00:06:02.219> to<00:06:02.250> about<00:06:02.819> 20

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
down slightly that brings it to about 20

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.420

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
over 8% down kind of thing but check it

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.890 
over 8% down kind of thing but check it
out<00:06:08.460> it's<00:06:08.759> going<00:06:08.969> to<00:06:09.060> shut<00:06:09.780> off<00:06:11.449> my<00:06:12.449> chorus

it's<00:06:55.979> assigned<00:06:56.370> to<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:57.180> tube<00:06:57.779> screamer<00:06:58.610> model

it's assigned to a tube screamer model
overdrive<00:07:00.569> so<00:07:01.349> when<00:07:01.529> the<00:07:01.620> pedal<00:07:01.919> is<00:07:02.250> up<00:07:02.729> it's

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150

going to turn it on the source is the

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.689 
going to turn it on the source is the
expression<00:07:09.930> pedal<00:07:10.139> again<00:07:10.830> it's<00:07:11.460> still

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
expression pedal again it's still

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.339 
expression pedal again it's still
momentary<00:07:12.240> but<00:07:12.449> check<00:07:12.629> this<00:07:12.810> out

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:13.349 
momentary but check this out

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.579 
momentary but check this out
the<00:07:13.589> range<00:07:14.599> it's<00:07:15.599> not<00:07:15.900> going<00:07:16.139> to<00:07:16.199> turn<00:07:16.379> on

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:16.589 
the range it's not going to turn on

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:18.740 
the range it's not going to turn on
until<00:07:16.830> I<00:07:16.979> have<00:07:17.129> the<00:07:17.250> pedal<00:07:17.520> almost<00:07:18.180> all<00:07:18.569> the

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
until I have the pedal almost all the

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.640 
until I have the pedal almost all the
way<00:07:18.839> down<00:07:19.080> at<00:07:19.319> 97<00:07:20.219> so<00:07:20.969> that's<00:07:21.779> where<00:07:22.139> listen<00:07:22.560> to

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
way down at 97 so that's where listen to

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.940 
way down at 97 so that's where listen to
this<00:07:22.800> so

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:23.950 
this so
