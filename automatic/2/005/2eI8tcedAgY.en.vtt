00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.590
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.750
 I will explain how to install trick 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.750
 neglect that I liked a lot 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.370
 but since it 's so aesthetic because I 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.070
 the comments of other videos I have seen 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.200
 people asking for him and looking 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.630
 iphone clicks I already found it like that 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.500
 that here go mobile 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.599
 allows me to change the iphone's slider 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.840
 ipod touch or ipad by which you 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.030
 want and also the text that here in 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.420
 theory seems to have slipped is what is not 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.800
 agreement the good change 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.190
 but he's going to teach us how to install the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 rauxa is idea 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.480
 wait, I put the password is already 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.640
 We hope to continue keeping 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.290
 but what I'm talking about 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.310
 ok let's say goodbye I just got from the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.310
 tour 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.359
 in a minute 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 it's a problem that I have to give 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 explained 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.910
 you have to go find 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.910
 And who can you look for? Let's put 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.319
 can you put 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.849
 6 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.189
 face slider 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.330
 402 we are going to install the iphone 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.700
 although here you can also modify 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.180
 because I have this side but it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.030
 answer to install click ice confirm and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.799
 spies to install and then I think 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.799
 that will ask you a break in the face 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.980
 and when 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.120
 then it is to turn on the device that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.680
 will appear wait 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.469
 an application such as this 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.920
 6 is the idea and you can see it together 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.920
 we enter 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.180
 here I have my denial that is or 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.720
 deactivate otherwise we're going to 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.970
 activate and we have four options let's 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.840
 to start below, here I will have to 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.810
 change the text of where it puts 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.610
 unlocked slide to unlock 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.050
 you can change it to your liking and put what 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 what you want 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.800
 abc an example 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.800
 I'll put 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.210
 jorge a paul who is my 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.780
 and then we give to another 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:58.350
 then also those three functions that is 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.180
 to modify the is the idea here in 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.370
 this in the camera allows you to make a 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.810
 picture here take a picture of your reel and 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.630
 Here are some that you have already done 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.630
 the sliders that you have made 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.250
 behind there down sorry those that you 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:29.530
 come then, if for example 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.530
 you want a green drop and put set 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.130
 wood 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.110
 and it is what Jorge says to Paul and what 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.110
 You see with the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.270
 and see if you want to create a slider 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.060
 personalized 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.810
 for example to road the highway will 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 will do the same in that way with photo 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.050
 with a picture but let's go to the road 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.050
 we were going to for example to catch 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.110
 let's catch 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.630
 and we are going to take this for example 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.389
 the photos of the element 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.820
 of low compared before shield 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.680
 of the step is not that I am 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.020
 old jealousy neither this nor anything else that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.060
 they are there so that no one will offend me 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.280
 then we put it in the center 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.800
 box this is the box in which 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.810
 all that is found is the box 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.620
 that appears in slide 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.620
 we leave it here 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.030
 and here we have a film or beige airways 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.439
 means 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.689
 then so all this as it says 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.159
 with the background of squares organized and 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.469
 whites do not sell it is the idea is 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:04.319
 know how if it were transparent and end 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.800
 what to do what to say fill in 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:12.659
 see actually the photo is worth sacchi 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.550
 You see that you put on TV itself and then here you 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.279
 so you give him many or take them away 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.860
 it seems that it covers the entire picture just one 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.449
 piece whatever in this case imagine 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.110
 that for example I want to remove the efe 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.580
 I would give grace 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.580
 I would suppress it in this way 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.820
 for example in quito a risk of the 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.820
 I give phil and I can go back to 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.449
 that just waits for the idea to come out later 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.340
 they can perfect it by the image that 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.980
 want her it's like that 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.770
 your is' continue this seems to you and 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.470
 When you see this, you already have 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.470
 your slider change here we will see 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.260
 they realize in the s 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.600
 but the f as we had removed it before 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.840
 it does not appear 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.450
 well that's all friends this is the 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.420
 first video and I hope to climb inside 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.900
 little some more than more tweets and so 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.710
