00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.169
 hello guys welcome to a new 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.910
 tutorial of our channel 29 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.280
 Today I want to show you how to configure 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.530
 the buttons of a mouse that comes without cd 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.610
 of software so stay a rating 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 with me and right now we see it 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.860
 good guys the first thing we have to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.460
 do will be download our program 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.640
 obviously this program is called ex 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.230
 mouse we have here I will leave the link in 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 the description and also updates for 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.430
 that you can download directly 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.930
 good for downloading terms 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.930
 that given the dispersion we give 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.820
 let's save file 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.470
 I'm going to cut him 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.489
 to all these plants that are around here and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.450
 I'm going to paste it here on the desk 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.200
 we can execute 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.990
 we install 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.920
 you see 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 I'm going to erase this this folder and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 simply leave in ex hands 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.850
 and once the wench has finished 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.140
 with the pick of rum to start 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 not just a window 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.200
 we have opened Lettrism we go down to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.240
 the right 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.619
 good guys here we have our 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.110
 program what we can see first 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.170
 view are the names of the different 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.240
 buttons that we can configure in the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.429
 squares on the right we also see 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.860
 different layers or profiles that we can 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.450
 establish according to our needs 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 for example a profile for when 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.909
 we are navigating and that our buttons 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.799
 work like back and forth and I you 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.929
 profile for when we're recording in 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.670
 my case for example and it works like you 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.700
 type of shortcuts 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.099
 let's change for example two buttons 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.110
 lateral louis we have button 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.930
 left button right the button the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.790
 mean these buttons were fire that 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.150
 are the sides wheel up wheel 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.799
 low etcetera 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.700
 I'm going to change the two buttons 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.200
 laterals for example 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.190
 this bow pib 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.750
 and this matter 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.700
 balears would use an example with these 2 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.770
 you will not change them in my case 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.650
 neither the wheel nor if you leave them 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.710
 defect to have them the shortcuts that have 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.590
 by default these buttons in my case the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.810
 Side buttons while I'm navigating 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.260
 towards appreciation before the supposed copy 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.900
 apart 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.220
 Well, we will also be interested in changing the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.220
 shortcuts to change 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.250
 cappa to another so we're going to give 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 series 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.920
 as if she modified we are going to give 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.590
 in April 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.330
 As you can see here you can activate 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.000
 the different layers in my case like 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.700
 I only have two shortcuts for 1 and 2 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.030
 for example if it is missing 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.550
 and for this if more with your sister 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.459
 when I could be more with you the more 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.730
 when you move to layer 2 and when you press and 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.430
 more move to the bolus layer 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.260
 so let's go with the example by 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.950
 example on the page that was llevant 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.530
 is I'm going to copy the writing from here with 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.319
 the button 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.450
 and I 'm going to stick it here as you can see no 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.920
 there is nothing open I promise you that I miss it 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.810
 with him with the mouse 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.239
 in the same way that we have done before 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.580
 we can change the different functions 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.400
 to the different buttons of our mouse 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.980
 in each of the profiles we can 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.830
 use the five profiles we can 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.410
 I'm sorry to use the first one and also 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.680
 we can modify some options of the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.630
 mouse roulette but these options are 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.540
 quite similar to those offered 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.500
 windows 7 in the control panel so 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 I will not talk much more about them 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.040
 so nothing this is all if it has 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.360
 liked to give light favorites and not 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.320
 forget to visit from time to time in 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.320
 our channel guys
