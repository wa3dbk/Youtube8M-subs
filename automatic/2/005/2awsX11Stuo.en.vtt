00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 Did you forget the idea before the fence 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.190
 hello to everyone at the request of the participants i 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.730
 I took Tutorials how to do so had 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.730
 we'll see 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 Now I will explain to you how to do it. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.020
 hard-fi 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.070
 I'll tell you two versions of how you can 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.820
 learn to do 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.460
 let's start with the lighter version so 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 look 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.130
 order to learn hartley 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.820
 you need to snap out your back foot pop 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.800
 belly back ie legs they 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 who asked if the cards to teach means 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.660
 many can do the trick so little by little 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 got closer to the end 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.110
 something like this 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.500
 back foot put awards due 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:31.180
 strong click like not click back 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:38.440
 but how deep down there is like not down 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:43.450
 just like back and humble from behind 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.390
 front leg plays in light version 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.540
 a smaller role will play a big 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.550
 role only when melting trick that is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.040
 and when can i paint over lord himself 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:03.010
 she will catch the trick the second version is she 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.470
 more complicated that is here we are still 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.530
 grind foot that is hard more 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.690
 control turns out to be beautiful 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.650
 through the point as they say still that is not 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:23.910
 here so here as namely through point and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.640
 as he does 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.550
 clicks and leg put not here on the edge 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 well, something like this is not 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.330
 the edge itself is like 3 feet or show biz. 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.550
 off about like this in a bookshelf 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.959
 leg from the bolts on the palm can be a little bit 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.030
 more blow put it not on the edge as in 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.440
 first version like this but closer to the middle 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.030
 and tilted like on a flip even here is our 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.030
 Lipu so usually this id can even 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.970
 a little more 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.830
 then sharply flip back and pull 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.560
 leg up that is not there and is not there 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.930
 top 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:14.910
 that is, approximately it looks like this 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:17.060
 here the foot goes up and it goes through 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:25.769
 beautiful point 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:31.200
 should look something like this 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:36.950
 should against so here are some mistakes 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.720
 happen when studying harvy with your back foot 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.630
 spectacled some weak teacher left from 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:51.049
 back and it turns out flew maps look not 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:59.760
 turns a full 180 degrees and turns 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:04:01.700
 about a grant from 160 to click 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:13.019
 the board is 180 degrees back that is 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 click more convincingly so what else 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.850
 I want to say you will certainly have 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.390
 some of the issues and sits on a point 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.260
 You will certainly not avoid it at all 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.510
 there may be such garbage but if you will 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.530
 nice to flip back the board on 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.740
 180 degrees of such problems you have 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 bye everyone
