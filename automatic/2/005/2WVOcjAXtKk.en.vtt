there<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.960> they'll<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.260> something<00:00:49.739> cool<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
they're in the cockpit of the cars so
yeah<00:01:01.199> let's<00:01:01.410> move<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.949> picture<00:01:02.250> which

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
yeah let's move on to this picture which

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.299 
yeah let's move on to this picture which
I<00:01:02.760> personally<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> most

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
I personally think it's the most

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.679 
I personally think it's the most
interesting<00:01:05.309> part<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.330> whole<00:01:06.450> video

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
interesting part of the whole video

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
interesting part of the whole video
because<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> Mercia<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
because if you look at the Mercia in the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
because if you look at the Mercia in the
background<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.110> wet<00:01:10.290> conditions<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.950> gone

codemasters<00:01:23.400> did<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.729> because<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
codemasters did this because this is the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.640 
codemasters did this because this is the
thing<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.869> bugged<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.350> f1

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
thing that really bugged me about f1

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.340 
thing that really bugged me about f1
2011<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.430> 2010<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.390> said<00:01:27.479> AI<00:01:27.720> never<00:01:28.080> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
2011 and 2010 she said AI never really

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.990 
2011 and 2010 she said AI never really
made<00:01:28.470> mistakes<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.159> Ron<00:01:29.430> PCN<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
made mistakes and I see Ron PCN you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
made mistakes and I see Ron PCN you
could<00:01:30.119> add<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> mate<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.100> yes<00:01:32.759> I'm

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
could add a more to mate so so yes I'm

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
could add a more to mate so so yes I'm
so<00:01:33.479> happy<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.869> codemasters<00:01:34.530> did<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so happy that codemasters did this this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
so happy that codemasters did this this
is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:35.880> amazing<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
is a pretty amazing thing that they have

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
is a pretty amazing thing that they have
actually<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> took<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> time<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
actually you know took the time to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
actually you know took the time to
actually<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.420> sure<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> AI<00:01:39.810> make<00:01:40.560> mistakes

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
actually make sure the AI make mistakes

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
actually make sure the AI make mistakes
at<00:01:41.250> different<00:01:41.579> times<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> mean<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.659> at

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
at different times I mean if you look at

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.300 
at different times I mean if you look at
the<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.140> cars<00:01:43.409> they're<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.100> making

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the other two cars they're not making

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
the other two cars they're not making
mistakes<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.810> thing

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
mistakes so it's a really good thing

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
mistakes so it's a really good thing
that<00:01:46.140> they've<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> game

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that they've had with that in the game

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
that they've had with that in the game
and<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.180> can't<00:01:48.479> wait<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.960> try<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.159> race

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and I can't wait to try out in the race

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.530 
and I can't wait to try out in the race
and<00:01:50.490> hopefully<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> couple<00:01:51.390> more

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and hopefully I can get a couple more

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.520 
and hopefully I can get a couple more
safety<00:01:51.810> cars<00:01:52.110> cuz<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.439> never<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.670> f1<00:01:54.530> 2011

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
safety cars cuz i never did in f1 2011

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.649 
safety cars cuz i never did in f1 2011
now<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.159> another<00:01:56.490> interesting<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.329> as

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
now this is another interesting bit as

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
now this is another interesting bit as
flip<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.079> master<00:01:58.439> goes<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.890> overtake<00:01:59.340> Jenson

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
flip a master goes to overtake Jenson

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
flip a master goes to overtake Jenson

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
locks up and I swear this the AI driving
or<00:02:05.939> actual<00:02:06.270> person<00:02:06.719> driving<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.530> whoever<00:02:07.740> it

or actual person driving but whoever it
is<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.849> looks<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.179> there's<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> be

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
is it looks like there's going to be

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
is it looks like there's going to be
added<00:02:10.440> features<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.099> where<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
added features like this where the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.979 
added features like this where the
wheels<00:02:11.760> will<00:02:11.970> lock<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> go<00:02:12.690> into

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
wheels will lock up as you go into

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
wheels will lock up as you go into
corners

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
corners

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
corners
too<00:02:14.070> much<00:02:14.220> being<00:02:14.640> over<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> shows<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
too much being over to the shows that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.870 
too much being over to the shows that
they're<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.170> just<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> arcade<00:02:17.460> so

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
they're not just going to the arcade so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.280 
they're not just going to the arcade so
on<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.330> trying<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.780> keep<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.020> little<00:02:19.140> bit

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
on they are trying to keep a little bit

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.900 
on they are trying to keep a little bit
of<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> realism<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> which<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.490> like<00:02:20.730> about

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
of the realism in it which I like about

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
of the realism in it which I like about
it<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:22.530> one<00:02:22.590> more<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:22.980> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it and I think there's one more thing in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.530 
it and I think there's one more thing in
the<00:02:23.310> trailer<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.820> you'll<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.150> interested

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
the trailer that you'll be interested

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.080 
the trailer that you'll be interested
about<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.040> final<00:02:26.430> shot<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.790> see<00:02:26.940> that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
about so in this final shot we see that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
about so in this final shot we see that
the<00:02:27.180> red<00:02:27.390> ball<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.140> overtake<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
the red ball is going to overtake the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.700 
the red ball is going to overtake the
Mercedes<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.750> hope<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.470> shows<00:02:31.650> that

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
Mercedes and I hope this just shows that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.250 
Mercedes and I hope this just shows that
in<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.430> AI<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:33.540> will<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.780> overtake

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
in the AI that they will just overtake

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380 
in the AI that they will just overtake
each<00:02:34.410> other<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.950> much<00:02:35.610> as<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.000> because

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
each other as much as they can because

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.790 
each other as much as they can because
you<00:02:36.630> know<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:36.900> cool<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.320> have<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.590> area

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you know it's cool to have the area

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.890 
you know it's cool to have the area
overtaking<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.610> then<00:02:39.150> own<00:02:39.270> lot<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.630> games

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
