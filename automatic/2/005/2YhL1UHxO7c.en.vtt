00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.630 
definitely a thing I would say invest in
because<00:02:35.130> especially<00:02:36.130> if<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.489> like

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
because especially if you have like

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.350 
because especially if you have like
really<00:02:36.880> tingly<00:02:37.510> dry<00:02:38.019> hair<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:39.120> breaking<00:02:40.120> hair

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
really tingly dry hair or breaking hair

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
really tingly dry hair or breaking hair
I<00:02:40.390> think<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.870> would<00:02:40.989> feel<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.290> good

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
I think it would feel really good

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.890 
I think it would feel really good
because<00:02:41.790> part<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.910> my<00:02:43.000> hair<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.360> still<00:02:43.660> died

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because part of my hair is still died

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.870 
because part of my hair is still died
from<00:02:44.260> her<00:02:45.239> still<00:02:46.239> dead<00:02:46.540> from<00:02:47.440> when<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.850> had<00:02:48.850> a

from her still dead from when I had a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.710 
from her still dead from when I had a
bleaching<00:02:49.569> incident<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.859> it<00:02:51.819> just<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.660> goes

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720

worth<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.810> um<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.350> know<00:03:14.620> they<00:03:14.950> also<00:03:15.130> have<00:03:15.459> many

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
worth it um I know they also have many

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.960

different<00:03:16.060> sizes<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.579> brushes<00:03:18.579> like

smaller square one so it would be like

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.729 
smaller square one so it would be like
that<00:03:31.329> big<00:03:32.489> compared<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.549> this<00:03:33.760> baby<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.739> that

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
that big compared to this baby like that

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.890 
that big compared to this baby like that
bigger<00:03:35.920> something<00:03:36.419> um<00:03:37.419> I<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:38.560> really<00:03:39.069> like<00:03:39.370> this
