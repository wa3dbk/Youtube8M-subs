00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 also just don't expect and she has 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.509
 so look met expectations 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 link osmond remembers that name 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 here to kids very last and being 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.269
 It is always the lessor best 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.760
 you almost expect it but we 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 have the drama series I omitted 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.730
 the level is particularly high this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
 last group 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 that of course is nice of this 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.769
 assess what you seen too eunuch 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.970
 in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 she becomes a second time 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 world champion over the caroline 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.969
 now costs a small one in innova 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.630
 lead to the short freestyle but must 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.630
 do it for a while 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.109
 triple lead triple tones 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.270
 john triple flipping 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.680
 beautiful the audience is crazy 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:52.580
 flawless freestyle from the Olympic champion 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.370
 and therefore also to the 30 through there enough 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.590
 no doubt about it 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.460
 yes they do all the very best 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.900
 figure skating has to offer both ladies 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.030
 hell fire the rest is good at it and this is it 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.000
 well so they are one or so much better indeed 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.729
 built just saying this was the most 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.150
 complete total package what I in times 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.490
 I have seen Jonah Kim I have not 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 girl dare with how many drops the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.300
 in sat i had something less than mine 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.430
 some others 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.280
 she said she and six out three forest to do and 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.199
 almost see 7 or 8 there 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.990
 but everything was just as spotless all 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.110
 elements in the plus 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.560
 so this was for me from one 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.560
 inimitable level 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.470
 no one could ignore that type here 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.230
 technology not in the jona presentation 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.850
 time is back and the saw it 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.230
 arrive in this season 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.130
 I got her first in Dortmund 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.930
 see the game again after a few years 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.570
 to demolish a few more mistakes too 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.370
 in korean series continues 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.620
 I don't think she has competitions 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.520
 driven this year in 2 races 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.540
 she wasn't needed either, because she was there 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.640
 where it was needed heavily and afterwards 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.460
 Kim is the queen of figure skating 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.530
 again beautiful those triple looks 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.270
 with a triple language on it 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.070
 get started 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.870
 for me that is a plus 3 that was 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.170
 nothing to complain about but that 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.170
 is flip 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.460
 to the last centimeter is the 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.140
 central hall of them is anything at all 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.470
 my language where iron on something 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.980
 create no that 's also a plus 3 here 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.980
 so as if 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.369
 it's all the stuff or do 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.079
 almost nothing to review according to me 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:56.879
 maybe no reviews at all 

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:59.089
 technical panel needed then that would just be 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:01.439
 exciting you for the stress that is pressure 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:05.519
 my higher points come 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:08.039
 yes yes beautiful that he actually still 

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.939
 never really seen in action that you are correct 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:14.699
 looks for the first time and I am not 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.049
 quickly impressed but this 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.369
 I think she is the very best yes I do 

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:19.199
 did not have it with the other category 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:22.489
 compare of course but I think if 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:25.229
 she continues to act that way for years 

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:27.649
 skating sport can dominate in her 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:30.539
 discipline and that is with the other 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:34.159
 disciplines look different that makes her 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:37.669
 I think such a phenomenon is Korea becomes it 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:37.669
 thick in 140 

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:42.599
 what my house is still needed in us but 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.879
 look 100 after rory in it there 48 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:46.829
 points she thereby comes close to 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.889
 her wild record that she during the 

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:52.109
 Olympics earned and hold 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.360
 year have 20 points about this 

00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:56.189
 series so drawn out like she is 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.469
 only those who were above 200 points could also 

00:07:56.189 --> 00:08:01.529
 but once on 118 points 

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:05.599
 please say incredible queen is 

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:05.599
 back and her name is millions of kim 

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.860
 hey
