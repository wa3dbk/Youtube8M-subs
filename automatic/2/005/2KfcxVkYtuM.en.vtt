hi everyone so um today I wanted to show
you<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.920> technique<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.790> bind<00:00:12.000> off<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:13.429> this

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
you a technique for the bind off of this

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.230 
you a technique for the bind off of this
pattern<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.480> created<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.400> I<00:00:17.400> call<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
pattern that I created and I call it the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.660 
pattern that I created and I call it the
leaf<00:00:18.869> lace<00:00:19.260> pattern<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:20.189> as<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.609> see

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
leaf lace pattern because as you can see

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.050 
leaf lace pattern because as you can see
I<00:00:21.240> put<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.600> dark<00:00:22.320> background<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:23.460> purpose<00:00:23.939> so

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
I put a dark background on purpose so

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.689 
I put a dark background on purpose so
then<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.510> know<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> bit<00:00:25.199> better<00:00:25.500> view

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
then you know you have a bit better view

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
then you know you have a bit better view
it<00:00:26.699> makes<00:00:26.939> those<00:00:27.119> leaves<00:00:27.449> those<00:00:27.840> very<00:00:28.230> pretty

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.189 
it makes those leaves those very pretty
leaves<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.150> I<00:00:30.150> created<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.750> pattern

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
leaves and I created this pattern

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
leaves and I created this pattern
because<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> wanted<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> match<00:00:32.189> some<00:00:32.430> gloves

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
on the side like this so on the pattern

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.099 
on the side like this so on the pattern
they<00:00:57.149> show<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:59.570> each<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
they show up like this and each of this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
they show up like this and each of this
little<00:01:01.469> triangle<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.640> 1<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.149> there

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
little triangle with like a 1 in there

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.200 
little triangle with like a 1 in there
is<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> symbol<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.189> says<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
is actually a symbol that says that this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.960 
is actually a symbol that says that this
is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.420> bind<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.979> our<00:01:08.220> 3<00:01:08.520> bind<00:01:08.729> offs

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is a bind off so this our 3 bind offs

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.990 
is a bind off so this our 3 bind offs
and<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.159> these

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and this is on the right side and these

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
and this is on the right side and these
are<00:01:12.360> three<00:01:13.229> other<00:01:13.380> bind<00:01:13.650> ups<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.580> are

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
are three other bind ups and these are

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.149 
are three other bind ups and these are
them<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> wrong<00:01:15.509> side<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.619> let's<00:01:16.860> start

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
them on the wrong side so let's start

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
them on the wrong side so let's start
first<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> see

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
first with this one so then you can see

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.590 
first with this one so then you can see
how<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> done<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> be

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
how this is done so this is going to be

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.910 
how this is done so this is going to be
3<00:01:21.960> bind<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:23.340> yarn<00:01:23.549> over<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.299> knit

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.450 

so<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.369> how<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> proceed

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
so this is how to proceed

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
so this is how to proceed
you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.970> scarf<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.710> side

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you have your scarf on the right side

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
you have your scarf on the right side

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.050 
and you're going to knit the first one
knit<00:01:40.020> 1<00:01:40.290> knit<00:01:41.930> 2<00:01:43.490> then<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> pass

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
knit 1 knit 2 then you're going to pass

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.500 
knit 1 knit 2 then you're going to pass
over<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.570> previous<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:49.340> knit

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
over the previous one knit

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.560 
over the previous one knit
past<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.960> would<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.230> to<00:01:53.560> bind<00:01:53.800> off<00:01:54.750> knit

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
past that would be to bind off knit

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.880 
past that would be to bind off knit
Passover<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.600> would<00:01:59.020> be<00:01:59.140> three<00:01:59.440> bind<00:01:59.680> off

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
Passover that would be three bind off

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
Passover that would be three bind off
and<00:02:00.220> then<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:00.970> have<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.180> yarn<00:02:01.540> over<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.620> it

off<00:02:26.230> three<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.770> then<00:02:27.430> knit<00:02:27.670> one<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.300> then

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
off three and then knit one and then

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.980 
off three and then knit one and then
pull<00:02:30.010> four<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.150> let's<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:34.210> again<00:02:34.420> you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
pull four so let's do this so again you

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.800 
pull four so let's do this so again you
do<00:02:35.200> this<00:02:35.380> as<00:02:36.660> knitting<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.940> knit<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.450> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
do this as knitting so you knit one and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.510 
do this as knitting so you knit one and
then<00:02:41.400> two<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.730> then<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.440> bind<00:02:44.650> off<00:02:44.890> one<00:02:46.410> knit

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
then two and then you bind off one knit

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.920 
then two and then you bind off one knit
pass<00:02:48.520> over<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.880> bind<00:02:49.210> off<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.780> would<00:02:49.990> be<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
pass over to bind off that would be to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.740 
pass over to bind off that would be to
knit<00:02:53.550> pass<00:02:54.550> over<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> bind<00:02:55.239> off<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.570> that

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
knit pass over to bind off and that

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.970 
knit pass over to bind off and that
would<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:56.020> three<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:56.830> I<00:02:57.100> knit<00:02:58.030> one<00:02:58.300> and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
would be three and then I knit one and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.620 
would be three and then I knit one and
purl<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.820> need<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.270> and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
purl and that's all you need to know and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.990 
purl and that's all you need to know and
then<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.550> directions<00:03:06.550> are<00:03:06.760> fairly

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
then I think the directions are fairly

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.800 
then I think the directions are fairly
straightforward<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:09.510> hope<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.660> you'll

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
straightforward so I hope that you'll

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.440 
straightforward so I hope that you'll
enjoy<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.890> back<00:03:12.100> by<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.760> way<00:03:13.000> so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
enjoy it this is the back by the way so

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.740 
enjoy it this is the back by the way so
it's<00:03:13.630> as<00:03:13.750> pretty<00:03:14.050> as<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.010> font<00:03:15.310> which<00:03:15.610> is<00:03:15.750> not

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
it's as pretty as the font which is not

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.920 
it's as pretty as the font which is not
very<00:03:17.280> common<00:03:18.280> with<00:03:18.730> lace<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.570> this<00:03:19.720> case

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
very common with lace but in this case

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.060 
very common with lace but in this case
it<00:03:20.080> worked<00:03:20.260> beautifully<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.060> enjoy
