rather it has to be like down here which
I've<00:03:06.170> already<00:03:06.290> started<00:03:06.710> doing<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:08.300> inter<00:03:08.510> men

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
I've already started doing the inter men

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.960 
I've already started doing the inter men
won't<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:09.410> able<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.950> spawn<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.580> here<00:03:10.820> I<00:03:10.850> don't

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
won't be able to spawn in here I don't

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:20.110 
won't be able to spawn in here I don't
think<00:03:11.780> any<00:03:12.320> way<00:03:12.560> with<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:18.200> know<00:03:19.030> there<00:03:20.030> are

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
think any way with you know there are

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.540 
think any way with you know there are
three<00:03:20.390> blocks<00:03:20.690> high<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.650> figure<00:03:22.160> if<00:03:22.340> it's

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
three blocks high so I figure if it's

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.020 
three blocks high so I figure if it's
two<00:03:22.790> blocks<00:03:23.000> high<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.040> room<00:03:25.550> they're<00:03:25.910> not

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
two blocks high in the room they're not

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.970 
two blocks high in the room they're not
gonna<00:03:26.150> be<00:03:26.270> able<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.450> spawn<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.080> that's<00:03:27.830> my

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
gonna be able to spawn and that's my

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.560 
gonna be able to spawn and that's my
hope<00:03:29.500> anyhow<00:03:30.610> you're<00:03:31.610> going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.850> really<00:03:32.060> want
