00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
because spreading maps apart is word and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.100 
because spreading maps apart is word and
decreases<00:01:55.000> your<00:01:55.090> damage<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.930> mobs

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.340 
decreases your damage you want the mobs
to<00:01:56.320> stay<00:01:56.560> as<00:01:57.040> close<00:01:57.370> together<00:01:57.670> as<00:01:57.940> possible

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to stay as close together as possible

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.040 
to stay as close together as possible
because<00:01:59.350> then<00:01:59.830> your<00:02:00.160> zombie<00:02:01.150> birds<00:02:01.540> are<00:02:01.810> doing

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
because then your zombie birds are doing

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.220 
because then your zombie birds are doing
much<00:02:02.200> more<00:02:02.440> damage<00:02:02.970> back<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.210> allieds<00:02:04.540> you

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
much more damage back to the allieds you

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.690 
much more damage back to the allieds you
usually<00:02:05.470> don't<00:02:05.800> want<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.160> kill<00:02:06.340> elite's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
usually don't want to kill elite's

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.940 
usually don't want to kill elite's
because<00:02:07.090> it's<00:02:07.300> just<00:02:07.480> too<00:02:07.930> time-consuming<00:02:08.230> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
because it's just too time-consuming and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.620 
because it's just too time-consuming and
they<00:02:09.160> don't<00:02:09.340> really<00:02:09.580> drop<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.149> good<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.570> you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
they don't really drop as good and you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.850 
they don't really drop as good and you
don't<00:02:10.810> need<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.020> Nephilim<00:02:11.470> Raila<00:02:13.860> sometimes

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
don't need a Nephilim Raila sometimes

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280 
don't need a Nephilim Raila sometimes
they<00:02:15.070> have<00:02:15.190> very<00:02:15.370> annoying<00:02:15.970> f<00:02:16.270> fixes<00:02:16.870> like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
they have very annoying f fixes like

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500 
they have very annoying f fixes like
vortex<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.370> rolla<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.820> think<00:02:19.090> these<00:02:19.300> two<00:02:19.480> are

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
vortex and rolla I think these two are

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.200 
vortex and rolla I think these two are
the<00:02:19.720> most<00:02:19.750> annoying<00:02:20.050> ones<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:22.090> you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
the most annoying ones and there you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.320 
the most annoying ones and there you
have<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.660> clear<00:02:22.900> advantage<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.330> Bavarian

over<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> witch<00:02:25.990> doctor<00:02:26.020> because<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
over the witch doctor because of the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.560 
over the witch doctor because of the
buryin<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:30.250> know<00:02:30.640> he<00:02:30.820> has<00:02:31.030> he's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
buryin just can you know he has he's

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.270 
buryin just can you know he has he's
running<00:02:31.959> with<00:02:31.989> Berserker<00:02:32.620> around<00:02:32.950> all<00:02:33.160> the

running with Berserker around all the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.270 
running with Berserker around all the
time<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.730> they<00:02:33.850> are<00:02:33.910> immune<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:35.280> such

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
time and they are immune to such

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
time and they are immune to such
controlling<00:02:36.970> things<00:02:37.239> especially<00:02:37.480> wart<00:02:37.930> eggs

if you still want to kill elite's the
best<00:02:43.780> thing<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.560> just<00:02:44.709> let<00:02:45.100> them<00:02:45.220> follow

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
best thing is to just let them follow

best thing is to just let them follow
you<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.880> lead<00:02:46.780> them<00:02:46.959> from<00:02:47.200> from<00:02:47.739> run<00:02:47.950> trash

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you and lead them from from run trash

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.180 
you and lead them from from run trash
mob<00:02:48.430> back<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.820> another<00:02:49.120> because<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:51.010> whole

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
mob back to another because this whole

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.920 
mob back to another because this whole
both<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.700> focused<00:02:52.060> on<00:02:52.150> killing<00:02:52.450> trash<00:02:52.660> mobs

both is focused on killing trash mobs

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.199 
both is focused on killing trash mobs
and<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.860> need<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.130> recruit<00:02:54.340> some<00:02:54.670> cool<00:02:55.060> downs

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and you need to recruit some cool downs

and you need to recruit some cool downs
to<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.540> reset<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.170> stuff<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.800> this<00:02:56.980> and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
and if you just right collides alone you

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.000 
and if you just right collides alone you
might<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.050> some<00:03:08.230> problems<00:03:08.260> because<00:03:08.890> we're

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
might have some problems because we're

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.500 
might have some problems because we're
running<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.370> mana<00:03:09.640> your<00:03:09.880> cooldowns<00:03:10.240> don't

running out of mana your cooldowns don't
reset<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.170> then<00:03:11.260> later<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:11.740> somebody<00:03:12.010> bears

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
reset and then later just somebody bears

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.550 
reset and then later just somebody bears
and<00:03:12.670> all<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.660> bad<00:03:13.810> things<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.440> don't

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
and all the bad things that you don't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.110 
and all the bad things that you don't
want<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.890> happen<00:03:15.040> actually<00:03:15.370> happen<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
want to happen actually happen and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.320 
want to happen actually happen and
there's<00:03:16.810> our<00:03:17.340> another<00:03:18.340> nice<00:03:18.640> use<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:18.970> mass

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
there's our another nice use of mass

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.310 
there's our another nice use of mass
confusion<00:03:19.600> by<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.930> way<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:21.810> here<00:03:22.810> even<00:03:23.200> if

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
confusion by the way and here even if

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.770 
confusion by the way and here even if
allies<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.280> just<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.760> ten<00:03:25.000> percent<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
allies have just like ten percent of the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.580 
allies have just like ten percent of the
health<00:03:25.990> left<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:27.400> move<00:03:28.180> on<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.690> not<00:03:29.350> work

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
health left just move on it's not work

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.360 
health left just move on it's not work
for<00:03:29.800> my<00:03:29.920> experiences<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.860> need<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.160> kill

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
for my experiences if you need to kill

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.160 
for my experiences if you need to kill
the<00:03:33.490> allieds<00:03:33.790> badly<00:03:34.240> because<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.600> their

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
the allieds badly because of their

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.930 
the allieds badly because of their
annoying<00:03:35.710> ethics<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.520> they<00:03:36.670> really

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
annoying ethics is and they really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.410 
annoying ethics is and they really
hinder<00:03:37.210> your<00:03:37.330> movement<00:03:37.780> then<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:39.880> use<00:03:40.120> a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
hinder your movement then you can use a

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.700 
hinder your movement then you can use a
nice<00:03:41.290> glitch<00:03:41.620> with<00:03:41.860> the<00:03:42.040> zombie<00:03:42.460> bears<00:03:42.700> and

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
nice glitch with the zombie bears and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.820 
nice glitch with the zombie bears and
usually<00:03:44.710> you<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.250> those<00:03:45.670> three<00:03:46.470> those<00:03:47.470> three

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
usually you have those three those three

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.920 
usually you have those three those three
branches<00:03:48.460> of<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:49.030> zombie<00:03:49.330> breasts<00:03:49.540> running

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
branches of the zombie breasts running

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.740 
branches of the zombie breasts running
and<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:51.340> you're<00:03:51.460> standing<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.970> corner<00:03:52.420> then

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
and if you're standing the corner then

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and if you're standing the corner then
those<00:03:53.560> three<00:03:53.920> branches<00:03:54.780> kind<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.990> collapse<00:03:56.470> to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
those three branches kind of collapse to

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.390 
those three branches kind of collapse to
one<00:03:56.980> branch<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.360> one<00:03:58.570> branch<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.400> a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
one branch then you have one branch of a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.910 
one branch then you have one branch of a
constant<00:04:01.210> flow<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.510> some<00:04:01.930> beers<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.470> this<00:04:02.770> is

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
constant flow of some beers and this is

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.050 
constant flow of some beers and this is
doing<00:04:03.220> massive<00:04:03.490> damage<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:05.709> you're<00:04:06.610> doing

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
doing massive damage and if you're doing

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.260 
doing massive damage and if you're doing
nice<00:04:07.270> position<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.920> can<00:04:09.130> kill<00:04:09.459> the

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
nice position then you can kill the

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.520 
nice position then you can kill the
Allies<00:04:10.570> where<00:04:11.020> we<00:04:11.140> fest<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.990> last<00:04:14.200> thing<00:04:14.500> that

Allies where we fest the last thing that
I<00:04:14.800> want<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.100> mention<00:04:15.220> is<00:04:16.380> how<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> finish<00:04:17.739> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
I want to mention is how you finish the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.460 
I want to mention is how you finish the
run<00:04:18.330> usually<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.540> want<00:04:19.690> to<00:04:19.840> get<00:04:20.020> yourself<00:04:20.140> in

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
run usually you want to get yourself in

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.630 
run usually you want to get yourself in
a<00:04:20.530> safe<00:04:20.709> corner<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.370> then<00:04:21.609> just<00:04:21.910> TP<00:04:22.150> out<00:04:22.480> and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
a safe corner and then just TP out and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.120 
a safe corner and then just TP out and
this<00:04:24.640> is<00:04:25.080> not<00:04:26.080> possible<00:04:26.350> all<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.890> time

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
this is not possible all the time

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.280 
this is not possible all the time
because<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:28.030> sometimes<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.600> have<00:04:28.780> just<00:04:29.110> as

in this one allied peg that is following
you<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.930> then<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.100> can<00:04:33.550> do<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.730> different

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you and then you can do a different

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.350 
you and then you can do a different
thing<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:35.710> don't<00:04:36.070> even<00:04:36.310> try<00:04:36.670> to<00:04:36.700> TP<00:04:37.180> out

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
you're just in the game and then as I do

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.500 
you're just in the game and then as I do
just<00:04:41.980> wait<00:04:42.220> those<00:04:42.400> 10<00:04:42.700> seconds<00:04:43.120> leave<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
game and if you die it's not really that

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.820 
game and if you die it's not really that
bad<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.630> because<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.840> also<00:04:47.110> collected<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> lot

also need to mention that this build is

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.540 
also need to mention that this build is
very<00:05:04.720> new<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.230> maybe<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.620> encouraged<00:05:06.220> some<00:05:06.460> of
