00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.510
 4 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.890
 for this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.890
 not so on the whole 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.239
 OK 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.289
 nothing to see 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.539
 Völklingen 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 Now I have one more problem 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 that's damn that's it 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.050
 Shareholders want 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 which I definitely never heard 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 Strings as he holds the chamber pull 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 I feel comfortable in the microwave 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.350
 I have no idea what happens 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.530
 so let the regime spent 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.650
 2 8 percent 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.470
 but to put Peter Koller dpa 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.370
 with himself 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.970
 Wallner is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.570
 Gera 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 I'm curious what happens now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160
 Orban 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
 Armor first 30 30 seconds 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.730
 it does not turn 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 that looks bad 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 afterwards it will not be clear 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 come in the train 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 what should happen 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.650
 Floor is crying 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.400
 APA 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 but first were 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.849
 but he is not that dry 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 you can see the jellyfish 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.449
 because it's still soaking wet 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.169
 that's what the class teachers mean now 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.929
 the classes at the minute or should 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.929
 the fit missed behind seat 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.929
 8 because of that 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.929
 to explain 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 let's not just promote 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.119
 this time even turned 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 Dr 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.989
 the band for reasons 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.989
 I think the picture is pretty nice 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
 after a few 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.329
 Miner excited 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.939
 theoretically, he would have to 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.329
 come recognized 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.329
 if he can really great 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.639
 suddenly explains easily 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.429
 it follows on 12 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.169
 but the consequences are 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.169
 Schepper jellyfish 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.649
 that is so cool 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.899
 maybe sometimes the window is open there is the Kreisstr 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.659
 Tom Hicks on the fly 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.059
 Quakenbrück 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.229
 miner 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.229
 but more did not do either 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.969
 and he stinks why 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.219
 he takes to himself now very scowled 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.219
 sometimes leads earned 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.360
 below
