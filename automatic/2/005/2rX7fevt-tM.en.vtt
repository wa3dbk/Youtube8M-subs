00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
into the air and it was absolutely

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.939 
into the air and it was absolutely

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
well now this is kind of similar and it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.460 
well now this is kind of similar and it
works<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> tank<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.289> need<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
works with a tank and you need a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
works with a tank and you need a
barracks<00:00:29.099> truck<00:00:29.460> as<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> start<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.150> the

barracks truck as you start here the
barracks<00:00:30.900> truck<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.289> either<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.560> blown<00:00:31.890> up

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
although it is a little bit difficult if

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.770 
although it is a little bit difficult if
it<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.530> blown<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.309> NECC<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.270> Jesus

can go high or lower but we noticed that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
can go high or lower but we noticed that
most<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> time<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> start<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.809> with

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
most of the time if you start out with

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
most of the time if you start out with
the<00:01:04.409> truck<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:05.189> being<00:01:05.610> exploded<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.299> you

the truck not being exploded that you
sometimes<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:07.020> higher<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.650> while<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.400> do

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
sometimes go higher now while you do

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.010 
sometimes go higher now while you do
this<00:01:08.850> glitch<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.360> know<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.659> fly<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in the tank now it is a little bit not

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
in the tank now it is a little bit not
complicated<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.299> pain<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> butt

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
complicated but it's a pain in the butt

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
complicated but it's a pain in the butt
to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.200> cuz<00:01:37.409> obviously<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> get

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
to get cuz obviously you do have to get

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
to get cuz obviously you do have to get
a<00:01:38.970> tank<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> barracks

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.100 
a tank and you have you to barracks
truck<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> works<00:01:42.299> best<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
truck but you know it works best at the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.539 
truck but you know it works best at the
military<00:01:43.680> base<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.040> obviously<00:01:44.189> those

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
military base because obviously those

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.560 
military base because obviously those
things<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.880> over<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> watched<00:01:45.509> my
