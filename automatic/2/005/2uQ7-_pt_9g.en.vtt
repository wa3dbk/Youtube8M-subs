00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.040
 tunnel 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.750
 we have the classic commands however the wind 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 become there is a bit like on bmw for 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 enter the letters we have button

 back button menu two function buttons 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 and these that allow if moved 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.250
 back and forth to go to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
 select the four functions you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 see here useful only for the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.109
 passing the volume set up there a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.179
 right because the pilot has everything underneath 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.610
 reach of thumbs look at how many 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.329
 controls arranged very very well 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 and before the eyes a panel 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.420
 completely lcd various possibilities of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 viewing by we are watching the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.469
 television but if we press the button 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.360
 view you see the tool becomes big 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.520
 tachometer and odometer and small 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.800
 instead the information related to that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
 that we are using but redo the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.149
 otherwise we leave small children 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.039
 tools or see all the various 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.170
 possibilities given by this system 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.930
 infotainment the radio we saw 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 first the media with television with 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.880
 the auxiliary input the CDs and the game 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 obviously to also connect the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.450
 bluetooth so as to reconnect obviously 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 also the telephone and the map that can 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 be can also be recalled 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 going to press the menu button 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 let's go here on our navigation 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.040
 sorry on paper it's all in French 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.020
 so you have to forgive me some small ones 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.270
 some little misunderstanding with with 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.090
 the language you see how nice the display is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.350
 of the great navigator in front of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.690
 made eyes there is no display 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.460
 secondary this is the only display that 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.200
 we have on the audi tt and also here the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 display can be made small 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.020
 if we want to give importance to driving 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.060
 compared to satellite navigation but 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.010
 we enter the menu we see the others 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.110
 possibility audi connect is always 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.520
 connected this this car we can 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.910
 give see fuel prices 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.369
 information on parking or surfing 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.860
 better to do it because it is also vocal speaks 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.320
 here we have the button to give commands 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 vocal make us read on our page 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.070
 facebook and twitter 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.740
 in short, a series of information 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.060
 unfortunately this is blocked 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.760
 infotainment so we can neither 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 change language neither me nor less connect 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.810
 our iphone to see what happens 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.200
 tried but in reality it does not happen 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.600
 anything 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.900
 back we go back let's go to 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.570
 see the part relating to the vehicle 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.950
 where it gives us the status information 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:36.489
 right on this audi tt 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.489
 let's go back 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.310
 possibility to adjust the sound 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.959
 then I'll show you how the media does 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.010
 can insert in the drawer 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.050
 glove box storage compartment that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.900
 can he 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.630
 I don't know if we can frame it ok, can 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.570
 house two seats one for the map e 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.120
 one to put music on a sim card 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.000
 for data connection and there is also a 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.330
 multi cd player sacd therefore unique team 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.210
 it's really well done 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.410
 very nice the LCD display up front 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.230
 in my eyes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.210
 in short, we hope they have it on trial 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.210
 because it really convinces
