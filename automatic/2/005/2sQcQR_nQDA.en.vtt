00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.429
 it was the shock of this 4th day of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.460
 league 2 in a stadium marcel picot quasi 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.250
 full for the record opposing nancy 6th to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 Nîmes 4th two teams with ambitions 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 yet very different 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 Nancy trying to find quickly 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.590
 league 1 after his failure of the season 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.519
 past while Nimes seeks at most 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519
 quickly to maintain 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.270
 crocodiles line up in attack the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.920
 duo anthony koura toifilou maoulida 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.329
 blending youth experience for a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.489
 explosive result 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.570
 since the beginning of the season the anthem 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.520
 Moreover, they are much more 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 dangerous early in the game and paul 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.250
 nardi should be used to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.870
 times to save his 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 the young 20-year-old guardian lent by 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.430
 the monaco ace but trained in nancy is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.449
 income for a season and he does the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.449
 greater good in his defense 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.130
 the excellent goalkeeper and drops 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.660
 toifilou maoulida financier then get 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.080
 release a little bit more to attack at 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.090
 his turn and mathieu michel visibly 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.390
 seems to want to copy his counterpart from 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.390
 evening 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.210
 the first half hour is therefore rather 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.930
 balanced the old ones doing mostly 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.940
 proof of clumsiness in front of the goal with 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.040
 a new opportunity here but this 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.270
 strikes well too crushed to deceive the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.270
 vigilance of mathieu michel 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.840
 and at the break the score is 0-0 no 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.860
 what to genuinely satisfy pablo correa 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.020
 Stéphane Jochem whistles the kickoff 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.070
 of the second period and both 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.650
 teams will definitely want 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 get more involved josé pasqualetti 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 is he rather happy with the performance 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 of his players tonight we said it nîmes 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.090
 does not really aim for the same goal 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.720
 that nancy and nimes resists rather well 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.630
 in defense until Roman sartre 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.200
 on free kick finally finds the top 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.200
 crossbar 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.020
 the former Lyon champion of France 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.820
 with the gones in 2003 did not find the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.200
 framework to make a difference in 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.970
 this meeting dances which then goes back to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.660
 attacked him with a new stop of 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.310
 mathieu michel the nancennes tries the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.360
 all for everything but will not succeed 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.150
 certainly not tonight nîmes came 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.270
 sturdy and strong in front of the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.270
 goal 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.970
 pablo correa still does not manage to 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.290
 smile and it is normal even Nîmes 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.690
 still creates a new opportunity 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.330
 with anthony koura who stumbles on paul 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.040
 nardine last time the doorman will have 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 been excellent from start to finish and nîmes 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.879
 will be able to be satisfied with this point 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.799
 shared while nancy misses the opportunity 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.569
 to stay in the top of the rankings 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.190
 proud of his eleven holders jose 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 pasqualetti would not even have needed 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.569
 make a single change
