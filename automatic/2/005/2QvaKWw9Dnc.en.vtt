and<00:01:53.610> play<00:01:54.300> through<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.600> level<00:01:54.900> again<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.110> might

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and play through a level again I might

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
and play through a level again I might
accidentally<00:01:55.920> take<00:01:56.130> another<00:01:56.430> path<00:01:56.730> that<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
accidentally take another path that I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
accidentally take another path that I
took<00:01:57.180> before<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.140> can't<00:01:58.410> go<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.800> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
took before and then I can't go back so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.830 
took before and then I can't go back so
then<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.910> guys<00:02:00.060> will<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.330> missing<00:02:00.660> out<00:02:00.780> on

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
then you guys will be missing out on

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
then you guys will be missing out on
stuff<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.620> it's<00:02:01.920> best<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.460> keep<00:02:02.730> it<00:02:02.910> all

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
stuff so it's best if I just keep it all

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.080 
stuff so it's best if I just keep it all
in<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.360> tape<00:02:03.690> on<00:02:04.380> by<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> way<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.580> is<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
in one tape on by the way this is a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.410 
in one tape on by the way this is a
psychedelic<00:02:06.480> zone<00:02:07.050> as<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.680> see

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
psychedelic zone as you can see

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
psychedelic zone as you can see
everything's<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.540> flashy<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.290> everything

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
everything's all flashy and everything

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.820 
everything's all flashy and everything
is<00:02:10.740> all<00:02:10.860> bouncy<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.640> those<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.240> some<00:02:12.420> high

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
is all bouncy and those are some high

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
is all bouncy and those are some high
hypersonic<00:02:13.830> spikes<00:02:14.310> whatever<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:14.850> to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
hypersonic spikes whatever you want to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
hypersonic spikes whatever you want to
call<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.360> why<00:02:15.810> did<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.050> jump<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.500> thing

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
call in it why did I jump at that thing

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.830 
call in it why did I jump at that thing
when<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.070> wasn't<00:02:17.370> open<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.820> don't<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.300> but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
when it wasn't open I don't know but

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.940 
when it wasn't open I don't know but
anyway<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.230> appears<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.590> we're<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:19.920> some

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
anyway it appears like we're in some

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.500 
anyway it appears like we're in some
sort<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> computer<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.120> here's<00:02:21.330> some

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
sort of computer and here's some

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.800 
sort of computer and here's some
invincibility<00:02:22.080> look<00:02:23.040> at<00:02:23.160> me<00:02:23.280> go<00:02:23.510> yeah<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
invincibility look at me go yeah it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330 
invincibility look at me go yeah it
really<00:02:25.050> does<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.590> feeling<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.160> we're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
really does have this feeling like we're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.300 
really does have this feeling like we're
in<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.790> computer<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.540> something<00:02:27.720> like<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.310> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
in a computer or something like that but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.040 
in a computer or something like that but
it's<00:02:29.940> probably<00:02:30.209> how<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.540> supposed<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> be

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
it's probably how it's supposed to be

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's probably how it's supposed to be
because<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> computer

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because you can see like the computer

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
because you can see like the computer
chips<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.520> stuff<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.970> background<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
chips and stuff in the background and

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
chips and stuff in the background and
the<00:02:33.900> flashy<00:02:34.380> lights<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.340> there<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the flashy lights going on there and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.500 
the flashy lights going on there and
this<00:02:36.270> reminds<00:02:36.720> me<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.900> should<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.400> um

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
this reminds me I should actually um

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.030 
this reminds me I should actually um
adjust<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> camera<00:02:39.870> settings<00:02:40.380> okay

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
adjust the camera settings okay

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.940 
adjust the camera settings okay
adjustment<00:02:41.580> done<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.690> case<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.560> in

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
adjustment done just in case just in

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
adjustment done just in case just in
case<00:02:44.120> because<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.270> game<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> little

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
case because this game can get a little

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
case because this game can get a little
bit<00:02:46.680> dark<00:02:46.950> sometimes<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.760> mean<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.060> part<00:02:48.300> of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
bit dark sometimes I mean it's part of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.570 
bit dark sometimes I mean it's part of
the<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:49.680> zone<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.250> pretty<00:02:50.400> dark

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the little zone can get pretty dark

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.160 
the little zone can get pretty dark
sometimes<00:02:50.850> because<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.390> background<00:02:51.930> like

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
sometimes because that background like

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.860 
sometimes because that background like
they're<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.709> went<00:02:52.860> dark<00:02:53.040> again<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.090> try

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
they're just went dark again now I try

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.750 
they're just went dark again now I try
to<00:02:54.900> eliminate<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.650> glowy<00:02:55.920> effect<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.610> I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
to eliminate that glowy effect that I

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.729 
to eliminate that glowy effect that I
get<00:02:57.030> around<00:02:57.209> character<00:02:57.780> sometimes<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.500> think<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
get around character sometimes I think I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.080 
get around character sometimes I think I
did<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.010> pretty<00:02:59.220> well<00:02:59.459> looking<00:02:59.910> at<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
did that pretty well looking at the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
did that pretty well looking at the
camera<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:01.320> slow<00:03:01.709> portion

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
camera on that really slow portion

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.490 
camera on that really slow portion
because<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.459> lost<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.910> my<00:03:02.970> speed<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.230> think

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
because I lost all my speed so I think

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.900 
because I lost all my speed so I think
this<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.770> gonna<00:03:04.890> work<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.310> well<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.760> just

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
this is gonna work out well and I just

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.130 
this is gonna work out well and I just
bounced<00:03:06.120> off<00:03:06.360> those<00:03:06.600> things

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
bounced off those things

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.290 
bounced off those things
at<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> top<00:03:07.890> those<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.880> bounce<00:03:09.060> off

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
at the top those are if you bounce off

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.670 
at the top those are if you bounce off
from<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.930> am<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.200> gonna<00:03:10.350> die<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:12.230> know<00:03:13.230> oh

have to wait for them to appear those

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.030 
have to wait for them to appear those
electrical<00:03:21.480> floor<00:03:21.870> things<00:03:22.230> they've<00:03:22.740> kind<00:03:23.010> of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
electrical floor things they've kind of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.590 
electrical floor things they've kind of
materialize<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> only<00:03:24.360> time<00:03:24.540> that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
materialize that's the only time that

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.480 
materialize that's the only time that
you<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.930> walk<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.170> them<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.740> run<00:03:26.190> around<00:03:26.400> on

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
you can walk on them a run around on

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.190 
you can walk on them a run around on
whatever<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.910> want<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.150> call<00:03:27.300> out<00:03:27.480> to<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.810> by

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
and the run on this flakes that's kind

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.439 
and the run on this flakes that's kind
of<00:06:10.530> my<00:06:10.680> fault<00:06:10.740> cuz<00:06:11.130> i<00:06:11.220> had<00:06:11.340> no<00:06:11.520> speed<00:06:11.849> i<00:06:12.030> needed

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
of my fault cuz i had no speed i needed

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.100 
of my fault cuz i had no speed i needed
but<00:06:12.659> whatever

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
but whatever

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.990 
but whatever
I<00:06:14.170> think<00:06:14.830> that<00:06:14.890> was<00:06:14.980> a<00:06:15.130> little<00:06:15.250> blind<00:06:15.700> on<00:06:15.970> the

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
I think that was a little blind on the

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.350 
I think that was a little blind on the
muck<00:06:16.210> on<00:06:16.330> their<00:06:16.540> part

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
muck on their part

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.240 
muck on their part
springy<00:06:19.360> and<00:06:19.990> another<00:06:20.290> screen<00:06:20.740> at<00:06:20.949> least<00:06:21.130> the

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
springy and another screen at least the

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.560 
springy and another screen at least the
springs<00:06:21.580> work<00:06:21.820> in<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.090> schedule<00:06:22.419> because

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
springs work in the schedule because

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.120 
springs work in the schedule because
remember<00:06:22.840> in<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.139> first<00:06:23.320> Sonic<00:06:23.710> Advance<00:06:23.949> I

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
remember in the first Sonic Advance I

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.680 
remember in the first Sonic Advance I
was<00:06:24.250> actually<00:06:24.580> able<00:06:24.850> to<00:06:25.030> stand<00:06:25.360> on<00:06:25.570> the

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
was actually able to stand on the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.820 
was actually able to stand on the
springs<00:06:27.030> going<00:06:28.030> down<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.270> slope<00:06:28.510> and<00:06:29.290> back<00:06:29.650> up

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
springs going down the slope and back up

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.230 
springs going down the slope and back up
the<00:06:29.979> slope<00:06:30.100> and<00:06:30.460> it<00:06:30.520> was<00:06:30.610> kind<00:06:30.820> of<00:06:30.850> more<00:06:31.000> like<00:06:31.060> a

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
the slope and it was kind of more like a

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.360 
the slope and it was kind of more like a
half-point<00:06:31.690> blue<00:06:31.960> we've<00:06:32.380> only<00:06:32.620> just<00:06:32.770> done<00:06:33.160> one

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
half-point blue we've only just done one

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.730 
half-point blue we've only just done one
since<00:06:33.580> this<00:06:33.699> one's<00:06:33.910> a<00:06:34.000> 2d<00:06:34.389> half<00:06:34.600> pipe<00:06:34.930> oh<00:06:35.169> no<00:06:35.440> no

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
in order to not die here comes a splint

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.370 
in order to not die here comes a splint
portion<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.270> see<00:06:52.479> I<00:06:52.510> knew<00:06:52.750> about<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:53.110> spikes

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
portion to see I knew about the spikes

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.080 
portion to see I knew about the spikes
there<00:06:53.680> this<00:06:53.919> time<00:06:53.950> so<00:06:54.340> I<00:06:54.400> was<00:06:54.580> able<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.820> avoid

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
there this time so I was able to avoid

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.510 
there this time so I was able to avoid
Oh<00:06:55.330> see<00:06:56.260> ya<00:06:56.380> I<00:06:56.560> guess<00:06:56.680> my<00:06:56.710> memory<00:06:57.100> isn't<00:06:57.280> that

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
Oh see ya I guess my memory isn't that

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.310 
Oh see ya I guess my memory isn't that
bad<00:06:57.760> that<00:06:58.060> like<00:06:58.240> that<00:06:58.389> unlike<00:06:58.690> is<00:06:58.840> what<00:06:59.020> i<00:06:59.050> said

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
bad that like that unlike is what i said

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.379 
bad that like that unlike is what i said
in<00:06:59.410> the<00:06:59.440> unfair<00:06:59.860> platformer<00:07:00.610> but<00:07:00.820> i<00:07:01.210> guess

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
in the unfair platformer but i guess

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.879 
in the unfair platformer but i guess
when<00:07:01.510> you<00:07:01.600> start<00:07:01.840> to<00:07:01.930> go<00:07:02.020> insane<00:07:02.500> you<00:07:02.770> know

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
when you start to go insane you know

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.310 
when you start to go insane you know
that's<00:07:03.100> when<00:07:03.370> the<00:07:03.930> memory<00:07:04.930> starts<00:07:05.290> to<00:07:05.440> go<00:07:07.260> am<00:07:08.260> i

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
that's when the memory starts to go am i

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.110 
that's when the memory starts to go am i
taking<00:07:08.470> the<00:07:08.740> same<00:07:08.950> path<00:07:09.190> i'm<00:07:09.460> pretty<00:07:09.880> sure<00:07:10.090> i

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
taking the same path i'm pretty sure i

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.159 
taking the same path i'm pretty sure i
am<00:07:10.270> we'll<00:07:11.080> see<00:07:11.289> in<00:07:11.410> a<00:07:11.440> minute<00:07:11.590> i<00:07:11.800> guess<00:07:13.169> because
