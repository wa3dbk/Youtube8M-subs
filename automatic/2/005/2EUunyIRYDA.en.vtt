00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
but I find that that's a great thing for

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.580 
but I find that that's a great thing for
where<00:01:49.820> time<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.360> course<00:01:50.660> but<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.350> kind<00:01:51.530> of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
where time of course but you kind of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.650 
where time of course but you kind of
gotta<00:01:51.740> blend<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> bit<00:01:52.550> in<00:01:52.730> me<00:01:53.210> I'll<00:01:53.360> which

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
gotta blend it in a bit in me I'll which

gotta blend it in a bit in me I'll which
was<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.930> tie-dye<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:54.890> ever<00:01:55.130> since<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.640> know

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790

swatching<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.600> kind<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.900> blends<00:01:57.110> together

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
swatching it it kind of blends together

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.770 
swatching it it kind of blends together
but<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.040> beautiful<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.330> light<00:01:59.570> lie

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.850 
light shade with a ton of glitter in it
I<00:02:01.640> find<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.360> over<00:02:02.780> an<00:02:02.870> eyeshadow<00:02:03.200> primer<00:02:03.500> it

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
I find that over an eyeshadow primer it

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.490 
I find that over an eyeshadow primer it
really<00:02:04.250> holds<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:05.180> all<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.570> glitters<00:02:05.930> you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
really holds on to all the glitters you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.900 
really holds on to all the glitters you
apply<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.770> with<00:02:06.950> your<00:02:07.100> fingertip<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.760> just

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
apply it with your fingertip and just

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.029 
apply it with your fingertip and just
press<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.179> onto<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.780> lid<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:09.920> you

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
press it onto the lid and then if you

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.340 
press it onto the lid and then if you
want<00:02:10.280> go<00:02:10.520> back<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.030> deepen<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:11.840> your<00:02:12.050> crease

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.840 
area I think that that just works out a
lot<00:02:14.390> better<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.990> don't<00:02:15.380> end<00:02:15.680> up<00:02:15.830> losing<00:02:16.550> any

the second I and then fill it back and I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.680 
the second I and then fill it back and I
did<00:03:01.400> mess<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.850> little<00:03:02.060> bit<00:03:02.209> there<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> got
