it because it gives it some Flair and
color<00:06:03.500> I<00:06:03.740> thought<00:06:04.400> I<00:06:04.580> did<00:06:04.790> think<00:06:05.060> that<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.330> was

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
color I thought I did think that it was

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.030 
color I thought I did think that it was
going<00:06:05.660> to<00:06:05.750> be<00:06:05.840> more<00:06:06.080> burgundy<00:06:06.380> towards<00:06:06.950> the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
going to be more burgundy towards the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.130 
going to be more burgundy towards the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
end but it kind of like today like a

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.750 
end but it kind of like today like a
half<00:06:09.500> kind<00:06:09.920> of<00:06:10.010> thing<00:06:10.160> here<00:06:10.370> because<00:06:10.640> it's

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
half kind of thing here because it's

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.490 
half kind of thing here because it's
where<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:11.030> was<00:06:11.120> layered<00:06:11.390> but<00:06:12.020> it<00:06:12.110> still<00:06:12.350> gave

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
where it was layered but it still gave

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.040 
where it was layered but it still gave

in so long so normally I never flat iron
my<00:06:19.790> hair<00:06:20.120> or<00:06:20.270> curl<00:06:20.570> my<00:06:20.690> hair<00:06:20.720> with<00:06:20.900> heat<00:06:21.200> I

always wear like a curl on put like perm
rods<00:06:23.840> in<00:06:24.050> it<00:06:24.170> which<00:06:24.710> would<00:06:24.920> make<00:06:25.070> it<00:06:25.220> a<00:06:25.340> lot

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
rods in it which would make it a lot

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.250 
rods in it which would make it a lot
fuller<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.270> thicker<00:06:26.300> so<00:06:26.810> that<00:06:26.960> way<00:06:27.080> would

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
fuller and thicker so that way would

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.040 
fuller and thicker so that way would
hide<00:06:27.440> the<00:06:27.620> line<00:06:27.830> of<00:06:28.100> the<00:06:28.340> actual<00:06:28.850> halfway<00:06:29.450> but

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
hide the line of the actual halfway but

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.200 
hide the line of the actual halfway but
I<00:06:30.110> do<00:06:30.230> suggest<00:06:30.860> that<00:06:31.190> when<00:06:31.430> you<00:06:31.550> wear<00:06:31.730> half<00:06:31.970> way

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
I do suggest that when you wear half way

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.080 
I do suggest that when you wear half way
you<00:06:32.450> put<00:06:32.660> a<00:06:32.840> braid<00:06:33.410> going<00:06:33.770> across<00:06:34.040> your<00:06:34.790> head

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
you put a braid going across your head

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.090 
you put a braid going across your head
so<00:06:35.330> that<00:06:35.360> way<00:06:35.810> it<00:06:36.020> doesn't<00:06:36.170> put<00:06:36.410> any<00:06:36.560> tension

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
so that way it doesn't put any tension

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.280 
so that way it doesn't put any tension
on<00:06:37.220> your<00:06:37.430> actual<00:06:37.790> scalp<00:06:38.180> because<00:06:38.330> they<00:06:38.960> can

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
on your actual scalp because they can

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.990 
on your actual scalp because they can
come<00:06:39.710> put<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.160> lot<00:06:40.340> of<00:06:40.430> tension<00:06:40.790> with<00:06:40.820> those

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
come put a lot of tension with those

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.450 
come put a lot of tension with those
