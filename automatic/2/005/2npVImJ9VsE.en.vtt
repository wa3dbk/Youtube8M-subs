00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
of the head in the center he had some he

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
of the head in the center he had some he
quite<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> hair<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.570> he<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.870> basically

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
quite a bit of hair so he was basically

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.100 
quite a bit of hair so he was basically
interested<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.489> occupy<00:00:44.969> decides<00:00:45.510> which

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
interested to occupy decides which

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.740 
interested to occupy decides which
number<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.649> angles<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:48.770> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> both<00:00:50.100> sides

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
number of angles and on the both sides

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
number of angles and on the both sides
so<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.780> planned<00:00:52.170> about<00:00:52.469> 2,000<00:00:53.010> grass<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.940> him

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
he has had a good results the density is

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.870
