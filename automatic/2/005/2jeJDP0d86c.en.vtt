00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.800 
and then 17 twice you can slide too but
I<00:04:18.229> think<00:04:18.410> II<00:04:18.500> consider<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:20.000> don't<00:04:20.540> know<00:04:20.630> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
I think II consider I don't know it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.310 
I think II consider I don't know it
doesn't<00:04:20.930> matter<00:04:23.020> second<00:04:24.020> one's<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.229> little

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
doesn't matter second one's a little

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.090 
doesn't matter second one's a little
weird<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.889> goes<00:04:25.300> just<00:04:28.960> like<00:04:29.960> before<00:04:30.440> instead

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
weird it goes just like before instead

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.900 
weird it goes just like before instead
of<00:04:31.220> like<00:04:31.340> sliding<00:04:31.639> up<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.410> Tanner<00:04:33.760> we're<00:04:34.760> just

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
of like sliding up to Tanner we're just

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.950 
of like sliding up to Tanner we're just
gonna<00:04:35.000> go<00:04:35.180> like

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.310 

so<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.170> seven<00:04:44.770> on<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.010> fourth<00:04:45.460> string<00:04:46.320> slide

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
so like seven on the fourth string slide

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.460 
so like seven on the fourth string slide
to<00:04:47.470> five<00:04:47.680> back<00:04:48.070> down<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.370> seven<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:50.290> then<00:04:50.380> we

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
to five back down to seven and then we

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.770 
to five back down to seven and then we
do<00:04:50.590> some<00:04:50.770> harmonics<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:52.330> some<00:04:52.480> reason<00:04:52.690> my

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
do some harmonics and for some reason my

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.660 
do some harmonics and for some reason my
guitar<00:04:53.080> I'm<00:04:53.620> not<00:04:53.830> being<00:04:54.160> able<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.370> do<00:04:54.550> them

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
guitar I'm not being able to do them

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.150 
guitar I'm not being able to do them
very<00:04:54.700> well<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.350> it's<00:04:56.350> gonna<00:04:56.470> be<00:04:56.620> fun

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
very well but it's gonna be fun

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.940 
very well but it's gonna be fun
the<00:04:57.250> fifth<00:04:57.520> fret<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.240> fifth<00:04:58.510> string<00:04:58.950> four

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
the fifth fret of the fifth string four

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.240 
the fifth fret of the fifth string four
on<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.310> fourth<00:05:00.550> on<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:00.820> fifth<00:05:01.090> string<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:03.190> I

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
on the fourth on the fifth string and I

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.650 
on the fourth on the fifth string and I
think<00:05:03.580> it's<00:05:03.760> kind<00:05:03.940> of<00:05:03.970> hard<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.240> tell

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
think it's kind of hard to tell

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.920 
think it's kind of hard to tell
this<00:05:04.840> is<00:05:04.900> how<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.080> did<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.500> at<00:05:05.620> least<00:05:06.720> five<00:05:07.720> on

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
this is how I did it at least five on

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.560 
this is how I did it at least five on
the<00:05:08.020> fourth<00:05:08.230> string<00:05:09.120> five<00:05:10.120> on<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.390> third

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
the fourth string five on the third

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.040 
the fourth string five on the third
string<00:05:10.780> twice<00:05:11.460> five<00:05:12.460> on<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.670> fourth<00:05:12.880> string<00:05:13.050> 4

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
string twice five on the fourth string 4

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.470 
string twice five on the fourth string 4
on<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.710> fifth<00:05:14.890> string<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.490> then<00:05:16.060> five<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:16.420> the

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
on the fifth string and then five on the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:28.980 
on the fifth string and then five on the
history<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:23.320> doesn't<00:05:23.500> matter<00:05:23.770> if<00:05:23.890> you<00:05:23.980> go<00:05:27.990> okay

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
history it doesn't matter if you go okay

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.379 
history it doesn't matter if you go okay
the<00:05:29.620> next<00:05:29.800> part<00:05:29.890> goes<00:05:30.190> like

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.149 

and<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.569> think<00:05:37.959> you<00:05:38.169> got<00:05:38.349> it's<00:05:38.529> exactly<00:05:38.979> the

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
and I think you got it's exactly the

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.570 
and I think you got it's exactly the
same<00:05:39.429> as<00:05:40.529> you<00:05:41.529> know<00:05:41.649> the<00:05:41.800> third<00:05:41.979> part<00:05:42.309> of<00:05:42.399> this

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
same as you know the third part of this

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.699 
same as you know the third part of this
one<00:05:42.819> it's<00:05:43.300> just<00:05:43.569> you<00:05:44.199> guys<00:05:44.349> can<00:05:44.589> probably

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:44.709 
one it's just you guys can probably

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.570 
one it's just you guys can probably
convert<00:05:45.249> being<00:05:45.550> notes<00:05:46.089> hopefully<00:05:47.219> and<00:05:48.219> if<00:05:48.399> not

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
convert being notes hopefully and if not

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.179 
convert being notes hopefully and if not
just<00:05:48.610> refer<00:05:49.239> to<00:05:49.269> the<00:05:49.449> first<00:05:49.889> time<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:51.039> learn

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:51.189 
just refer to the first time you learn

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.010 
just refer to the first time you learn
this

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.719 

it's<00:05:57.020> exactly<00:05:57.289> the<00:05:57.500> same<00:05:57.590> is<00:05:57.800> that<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.490> last

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
it's exactly the same is that the last

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:08.820 
it's exactly the same is that the last
part<00:05:59.000> we<00:05:59.090> guys<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:05.300> 17<00:06:05.840> on<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.020> first<00:06:07.750> 1921

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
part we guys so 17 on the first 1921

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.800 
part we guys so 17 on the first 1921
Bend<00:06:09.830> up<00:06:11.949> half<00:06:12.949> a<00:06:12.979> step<00:06:13.250> again<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:13.879> release

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
Bend up half a step again and release

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.779 
Bend up half a step again and release
the<00:06:15.650> 19<00:06:17.199> pull<00:06:18.199> off<00:06:18.319> to<00:06:18.469> 17<00:06:18.889> when<00:06:19.520> we're<00:06:19.639> in<00:06:19.729> bed

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
the 19 pull off to 17 when we're in bed

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.760 
the 19 pull off to 17 when we're in bed
in<00:06:19.969> 17<00:06:20.330> up<00:06:20.449> to<00:06:20.539> 19<00:06:21.430> at<00:06:23.169> 1712<00:06:24.169> two<00:06:24.409> more<00:06:24.560> times

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
in 17 up to 19 at 1712 two more times

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.320 
in 17 up to 19 at 1712 two more times
and<00:06:25.039> then<00:06:25.159> we're<00:06:25.280> done<00:06:25.370> okay<00:06:27.129> so<00:06:28.129> that's<00:06:29.060> the

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
and then we're done okay so that's the

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.819 
and then we're done okay so that's the
whole<00:06:30.520> main<00:06:31.520> part
