00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.540
I’m never able to have an idea about what the soundtrack would be when danced.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.040
I imagine something like this.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.000
The wave is actually the theme of this soundtrack until the end.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.240
This has become part of the show, a typical characteristic of Grupo Corpo,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.780
this work in which the poetics of the song, dance, space, light, scenery, all of this speaking about the same thing.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.300
Like this, Maculan.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.460
In the last part, when it talks about “without me”,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.300
this trapdoor falls from above. As if it were about to fish again,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.060
because in the middle of the show, it fishes people, who are going to be there.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.340
As if it would fish no one.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.160
You can do the same thing, but spinning...

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.920
Look how beautiful these things are guys, look at this. 
The only thing we need is a lighting technician

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.140
More to the center, all right Macau?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
group therapy, collage and handicraft.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.980
Look how beautiful!
Look!

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.200
Try to move the cyc to the back as much as you can.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.220
Sem Mim is entirely based on the songs by Martín Códax,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.120
which are Galician-Portuguese songs from the 13th century.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.620
Carlos Nuñez, a Galician instrumentalist, fascinated by these songs by Martín Códax,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.560
came to me and presented the songs and the idea

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.600
that these songs would be sung by Brazilian singers, through Brazilian music.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.960
We came to where we are layer by layer, that is, from contemporary instruments.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.320
So there’s the Brazilian European, the erudite and the popular

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.500
with the profound spirit of those medieval songs.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.160
Another crucial characteristic of Sem Mim is the encounter of voices.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.720
I think that at the end, the skirts are a great costume finding.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.780
It is as if each dancer would take with himself the wave that he... that turns around him like this.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.580
The song talks about the pretty body, the poem talks about this.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.760
It’s one of these coincidences...

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:41.440
right in the middle, there’s a poem from the 13th century that talks about a beautiful body that dances.
