00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.100
 percent 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.230
 so if someone is someone else one 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.219
 the parties have three days to want this 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.239
 person 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.399
 something here for example such as 

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:17.779
 things ha 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.689
 just now i will show as soon 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.689
 such terms are full of stress 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.099
 partly continuing ultimately 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.550
 all is ready 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.590

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.820
 rats 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 I specially prepared a rally 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.100
 it seems so 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.080
 December 16 16 can push jay z 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.380
 the situation around means 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.800
 so how 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.310
 such things 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.220
 so you too, where the chest should 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.610
 to be desired offers you on 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.680
 choice revered bridges sense 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.340
 just to be concerned 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.840
 how many there can be there are those who 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.660
 then edible calm flow 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 oil for sausage 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.470
 complaints that is there can be in 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.740
 gpu writes subjects 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.570
 there is hope klitschko 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.020
 comers 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.260
 Bishkek and spelled 1 so simply because 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.380
 live 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.670
 further only rice you want only 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 find out about it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.500
 to 400 district 1056 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.150
 the list is not worth it but go 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.170
 the subject 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.549
 but I don't know the ideal came only in 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.340
 including esteemed as 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 start the show warm up 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 fine now and the second player crisis 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.080
 professor show what's in the blood 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.330
 or what has already touched gave answered kulichkah 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.600
 can see 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.909
 these things are like in the river rod 32 east 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.860
 as we lay 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 sixteen 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 Now which has 64 tobacco 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 that is, a divorce is a must for 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 this patience 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.950
 it should be exactly double chest 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.279
 princess 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.549
 now three quarters of one thing 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.369
 to throw the committee 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 but also a sign 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.489
 Here are just the main topics on August 16 in that 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.019
 how did 64 to the most you can do 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.769
 absolutely all uah 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.169
 subject even with spammers scoring 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:30.989
 like youtube 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.869
 receive 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.709
 and I want 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.670
 show one thing is definitely not 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.769
 check project serbia 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.349
 order 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.909
 let's deadlines 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.909
 the respondent 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.810
 not by chance it seems to us 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.019
 paradoxical from which not 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.949
 prepared by the way 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.409
 investors are worried about the question of what 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.409
 the fact that people 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.599
 So 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.689
 otherwise this tank 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.689
 do you feel bad about the bus 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.679
 reportedly 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.679
 Gold went for its second goal 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.189
 dollars in western Siberia in the evening 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.359
 however 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.870
 I emphasize 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.539
 like this 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.849
 lift the slipper 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.009
 so to make enterprise 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.519
 Russian human rights defenders and 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.379
 London 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.769
 nothing like that 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 per share 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.809
 work 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.049
 or here 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.629
 how about this 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.629
 public 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.909
 dollars 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 couple 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.169
 m 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.829
 but 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.549
 so now my own righteousness 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.069
 photos of short briefing 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.499
 itar tass do it 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.629
 I left there 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.629
 so it means what we see in this message 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 such calculations are average annual 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.059
 per day 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.549
 so how to get out of the chest I can not it 

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.509
 assets open in any way 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.509
 what to do about milk besides 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.160
 several vehicles yet 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.340
 second Chernobyl Ukrtransnafta 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.059
 net court loss 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:50.650
 stein nameplate clothing and textile cable 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.650
 damage 1 1 1 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.080
 So 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.080
 buy 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.440
 just like that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.900
 turned out let that evening show 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.539
 how 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.210
 wsj 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 company deal 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
 this factor 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.879
 Plus besides Alexander Smirnov 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.879
 also precipitation 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.110
 so what do you imagine 14 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.449
 for the first time in a year after 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.960
 so the attempt came to the apartment 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.659
 discoveries 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.499
 but I can not think he 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.960
 but he was upset about some points 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.520
 the reasons 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.789
 and swim is done only not 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.849
 took 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.849
 opening with party leadership 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.490
 so thank you all for your attention 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.250
 subscribe yourself on the map of February 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.389
 live schedule 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.559
 through this 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:07.199
 thousands ranging from comment and if 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.609
 who else can say i believe that who 

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.300
 tell me something 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.300
 the priority remains the question is still open 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.379
 only a secret someone think there is a committee 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.789
 in a kaleidoscope of 100 Louisiana 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:20.749
 f 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.749
 her new production 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.610
 perhaps some through 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.789
 half an hour more 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.129
 but we want than through the tube from there 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.150
 ten after which idea perhaps 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.389
 making utterly squandered the masses 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.389
 so well, thank you for your attention 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.080
