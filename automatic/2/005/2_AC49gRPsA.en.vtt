00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
first it's 11 inches long and then we

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.310 
first it's 11 inches long and then we
took<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> dahling<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> buy<00:01:57.750> didn't<00:01:57.990> even<00:01:58.140> cut

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
took the dahling to buy didn't even cut

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.510 
took the dahling to buy didn't even cut
this<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.829> wanted<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.399> long

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
this because I wanted it to be as long

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
this because I wanted it to be as long
as<00:01:59.670> possible<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.380> stapled<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.740> both

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
as possible and stapled it on on both

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
as possible and stapled it on on both
sides<00:02:02.189> there's<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> every<00:02:03.090> side<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.479> well

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
sides there's one on every side as well

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.370 
sides there's one on every side as well
and<00:02:04.549> then<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.820> cut<00:02:06.329> smaller<00:02:06.630> pieces<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.290> are

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and then I cut smaller pieces that are

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.609 
and then I cut smaller pieces that are
two<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> half<00:02:07.829> inches<00:02:08.009> long

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
two and a half inches long

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.160 
two and a half inches long
and<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.759> attached<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.330> bottom<00:02:10.539> so

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and just attached it to the bottom so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.449 
and just attached it to the bottom so
that<00:02:11.230> way<00:02:11.379> it<00:02:11.500> could<00:02:11.620> stand<00:02:11.890> up<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.159> its<00:02:12.220> own

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
that way it could stand up on its own

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.550 
that way it could stand up on its own
and<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.780> does<00:02:14.019> stand<00:02:14.260> up<00:02:14.379> it<00:02:14.530> just

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and like it it does stand up it just

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.690 
and like it it does stand up it just
looks<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:14.890> it's<00:02:15.069> leaning<00:02:15.159> against<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.640> wall

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
looks like it's leaning against the wall

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.440 
looks like it's leaning against the wall
right<00:02:15.940> now<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.360> yeah<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.849> stapled<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.330> on

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
right now but yeah and so stapled it on

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.729 
right now but yeah and so stapled it on
and<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.750> painted<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.140> blue<00:02:20.379> with<00:02:20.560> some

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
and then I painted it blue with some

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.199 
and then I painted it blue with some
paint<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.069> found<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.340> my<00:02:21.370> basement<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.909> voila

paint I found in my basement and voila

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.119 
paint I found in my basement and voila
this<00:02:22.390> took<00:02:22.540> about<00:02:22.690> 20<00:02:23.590> minutes<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:24.010> make

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
this took about 20 minutes to make

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.039 
this took about 20 minutes to make
