00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
 rare karima 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370
 I wanted them to be released 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 this attitude 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.460
 these criteria 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 the global balance of all Senegalese 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.420
 that's why I really 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.500
 that's good I was really at malawi 1-1 at the war of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.620
 gas more than with losses 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 and then their dear studies 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.200
 I have to see again 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 we do not care the fight perseverance fight tokens 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.899
 looking at this tension because it's important but has kept the 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.919
 same line 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.119
 we can very well be free e them for example the overall trend of the plan 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.819
 of work let's take the example 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.729
 under the aegis elsewhere to pass the general tests 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.729
 it is not necessarily eighteenth century 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.829
 the CEO of edf has already been the subject 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.669
 as in 22 languages â€‹â€‹the capture of laurent gbagbo 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.649
 I had a little trouble at the beginning of the year 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.649
 in any case it moves me 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:35.959
 and on Sunday
