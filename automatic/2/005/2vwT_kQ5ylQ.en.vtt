00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.460
 we see that the rivers are dying by 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.700
 pollution and on the exploitation 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.840
 unmerciful of the rivers then 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.660
 us as community santarroseÃ±a 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.980
 we are worried about this and thanks to 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.480
 the prescription and authorities 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.590
 headed by the governor the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.509
 Mr. Mayor and the authorities have 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.480
 what to see in the matter to try to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.429
 stop this because in the future 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.289
 Santarrosa is going to be very affected 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.720
 since the river is unfortunately 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.249
 too contaminated and the effects that 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.500
 is going to have the community are a mess 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.280
 you see that the province of gold is a 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 province that is threatened with 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.220
 very high cancer ranges and we know that 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.100
 one of the causes is pollution 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.620
 of the environment and rivers 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.120
 then it's time to stop this because if 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.130
 it is true that there is talk that in the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.600
 future the war is going to be for the water 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.550
 but it's not going to be because of lack of water 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.430
 but because the water is contaminated they are 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.590
 the informal informal miners or 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.960
 those illegal polluting 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.040
 the city pollution because they start 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.420
 to do works of themselves 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 disorganized in the river then that 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.730
 makes all the minerals that are 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.230
 inside the subsoil rise up and these 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.510
 they are dragging the river and reach 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.520
 affect the whole community 97 the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.070
 authority 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 Well we see it with pleasure but what it 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.640
 we aspire that it is not simply a 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.549
 visit but decisions are already made 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.560
 actions are taken to try to 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.049
 definitely paralyze this so 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.359
 that we applaud the intention of the 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.189
 authorities to make the journey towards 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.420
 the infection and demand those 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.250
 dealers that are doing 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.929
 mining the way it should be done 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.789
 mining we have not come here to cause 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.709
 machinery we have not come we know that 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.689
 here illegal mining is being done 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.149
 we all know it but we are going to take 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.520
 the precautions of the case we are going to take 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.989
 already at this moment we are determined to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.489
 Take the actions that should be taken 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.899
 we have come to talk with the 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.959
 dealers to tell them to comply 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.880
 the commitments we are going to make operative 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.890
 of constant operational control of 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.569
 control in the day and at night as 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.920
 should be done let's do it and what 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.420
 we are saying frontally on the day 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.829
 and at night for those who are 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.630
 doing illegal mining that are us 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.099
 listening do not do it so that after 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.510
 do not have the problem that the defendant 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.130
 the machinery or they have taken them 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 that's why we the law is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.000
 empowered to do this what we are going to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.560
 enforce last week there was the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 Mayor's concern today we are 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.489
 Here we are going to show that we are 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.300
 working that we're not covering up 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.860
 nobody we are not 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.080
 nobody wants things to be done 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.280
 well things are attached to the law and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.110
 to the right we will see the commitments 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 we are going to reach agreements and we are going to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 make those commitments are met 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.700
 let's make a deadline this has to 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 be immediately to a term we are 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.010
 over a winter like you 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.360
 they see what attracts us the most, they call us a lot 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.920
 the attention is to see how he has moved 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.630
 large amount of land and it has not 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.850
 remedied has been left like this this was a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.920
 tourist part was a part of where 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.280
 many people from Santa Rosa came to 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.380
 do the weekends I always have 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 come to this and I realize I give myself 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.620
 account of this and this is what we want 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.020
 remedy to do the controls do the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.040
 effective controls do the controls 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.660
 immediately that the authorities act 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.310
 immediately we are going to 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.230
 prove to the public that we are going to 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.420
 act immediately us as 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.210
 representatives and then we have to 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.550
 the good answer we have a 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.110
 intense pressure in front of the problems 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.270
 that have been giving contamination 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.820
 not only in the holy river pink but 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 in all the rivers that you have to have 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.950
 santa rosa therefore we what 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.330
 what we want is not to have problems 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.950
 with nobody and we have said sir 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.800
 governors we go away to the law 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.349
 ability to terminate the use permit 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.830
 of soil us in our part I 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.810
 so be legal being legal we do not go 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.940
 to give permission the regulation of the use 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.790
 of the soil if any if any 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.120
 dealer is not complying with the law 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.920
 or simply within your concession there 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480
 people who are working and not 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.580
 help control having the same 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.549
 grant us just what 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.900
 we have to abide by what the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.180
 constitution what the code says 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.580
 organic and coordinate with 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.640
 institutions that have to do with the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.010
 part the operating part or the part 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.890
 mining nobody opposes the minority in 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.110
 this legal what we oppose is to the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.000
 pollution what he proposes to us what 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.000
 we are opposed to illegal mining 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.410
 let's start 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.670
 but that this does not only serve in 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.590
 meetings let's come after tomorrow the 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.590
 meeting let's go to the facts 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:59.110
 and that here the illegals do not have 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.370
 absolutely nothing to do here so much 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.370
 on the river nobody 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.630
 it's going to be a remediation
