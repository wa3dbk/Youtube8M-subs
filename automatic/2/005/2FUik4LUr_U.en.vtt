00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 How about we make a bird of 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.470
 meat to gather the friends of the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 brother friend champion calls a billion 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.600
 the first thing we'll do 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.219
 I'll prepare with the cake 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.219
 vinaigrette I'll cut half onion 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 the engineer 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.110
 joÃ£o ii 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.840
 River 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.700
 think the tomato we will make a 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.700
 quantity because it is here 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 Now I'm going to start cutting the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.789
 pastel tried to cut onion and garlic one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:37.350
 bit of chilli pepper that 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:39.840
 that first blue whale also goes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.750
 put a wire of olive oil in the skillet 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.849
 which is to broil the garlic to onion and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.170
 then give a boost in the meat 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.420
 this burden that we will use a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.819
 dry meat made with the hard 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.950
 it is a very fibrous meat it stays after 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.709
 that we put in the pressure for 40 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.360
 minutes it becomes easier to shred 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.689
 so we can make the filling 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 of pastel and beyond what I or 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.479
 I saluted her 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 we will start by first focusing on 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.399
 Onion and onion have water there that people 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.069
 will do if you put the first there and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 then the onion we the garlic and the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.510
 onion did not finish cooking 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.430
 now that the onion has already doubled 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.830
 I'll throw the garlic we put 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.090
 Scent pepper here we bray 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.090
 she loosens the flavor 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.180
 and now I 'm not going to start putting it down 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.180
 pitt 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.549
 the plot is already all gingerbread 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.609
 I'll get the meat going back it 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.810
 was we'll get a little to 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.829
 she gets younger we can 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.829
 stuff the pastries 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.349
 I'm going to use that cake dough already. 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.790
 soon as people buy in the market that 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.790
 it's simpler easier 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.550
 the china down 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.230
 This is our role, I'm going to do more 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:42.310
 Now we'll take it all later. 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:46.770
 whistle game played out of mouth water 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.770
 Let's go inside and let him fry 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.930
 It's cool, we'll leave a little bit here. 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.390
 in the corner that happens the car itself 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.870
 heat from the pan will make an excess of 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.579
 The oil that is coming down to this one is 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.349
 that vinaigrette that we mentioned 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.819
 now I 'm going to temper it I'll put a 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:21.019
 little vinegar olive oil and a little bit 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.019
 of salt goes now we just mix well 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.770
 And I think
