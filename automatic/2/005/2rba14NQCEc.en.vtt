 he is protesting he is there himself he was there Euro 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.039
 also 8 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.740
 finally she is over 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.889
 Exclusivity of the two GTA Eltons which so far only for the Xbox 30 Dieter 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 Helbig were 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.330
 with Ephesus from Liberty City scenes at 11 and finally finally for the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 PlayStation 3 available Aplerbeck and has now done a great deal 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.429
 No, of course, the same content with the ex-daughter 60 version um 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.370
 but still, and of course, a lot is on offer, we are here now 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.460
 for example, the first scenes 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 Burdening the MT the best of the two add-ons 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850
 in the man described made 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 Johnny Klebitz 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 a hard-hitting biker of the common percent in the East in the hand 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 that would have to make a mistake at kerpen-buir formation drive 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.490
 That's why bikers and percent make it clear again 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.350
 That has even been doubt with seven games we have been using this feature 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.830
 Charge energy 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 and also together on one of the vehicles Baghlan 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.610
 from the Harz to drive the Minister so in formation approx 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 rtr 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.620
 Of course, there are also crisp missions 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.430
 here is, for example 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.620
 the one in the 4th 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.160
 Rob Friend Motorcycles is standing 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.720
 around and 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.320
 the lawyers are being loaded onto a truck and now question the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.260
 Shirts shirts 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.500
 it is again as in title four that you get permanent calls but it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.290
 not many a total annoyed 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.990
 that's just about could 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.830
 Of course there are many who look 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.409
 but not as many as in June 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.960
 but in the main game, of course, the game mechanics also use these components 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.020
 For example, unholy leads deliberately 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 but how many beautiful reinforcements have called and they are now helping 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 this mission and Barthel on the line 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 because we still have to believe that soft 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.770
 Fischer had cared 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 formally behind the enemy lines and the motto 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 "Now it's up to the truck 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.719
 the same time damaging beautiful 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.420
 the mission design up to the point percent as in all classes so good because 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 Everything works great and makes a lot of fun the enormous 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.009
 Expenses team 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.009
 There are also many critical moments 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.330
 for example, in both directions limits 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.569
 that's an open ear that's part of it 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 but between typical sequences are the mission design 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 17 Tietjens HÃ¼tte already has something to buy 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.229
 Richard Arnold Lawyer 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.609
 he almost acts sometimes 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.799
 but no matter
