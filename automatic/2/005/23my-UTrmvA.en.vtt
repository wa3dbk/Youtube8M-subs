without any further ado let's get into
the<00:00:19.230> strategy<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> put<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:20.939> first<00:00:21.359> 4<00:00:22.020> P

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
the strategy so you put your first 4 P

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920 
the strategy so you put your first 4 P
workers<00:00:23.310> into<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> gold<00:00:24.090> man<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> take

workers into the gold man and you take

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.540 
workers into the gold man and you take
the<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.080> worker<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.830> build<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.160> art<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the first worker and build your art of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
the first worker and build your art of
the<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:26.939> worker<00:00:27.240> coming<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.769> town

hall will build your barrack so the next

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
hall will build your barrack so the next
step<00:00:32.070> will<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.809> main

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
Hall you're gonna put him and build your

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.330 
Hall you're gonna put him and build your
first<00:00:48.329> farm<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.680> gonna<00:00:49.800> continue

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
first farm then you're gonna continue

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.639 
first farm then you're gonna continue
building<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.910> lot<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> workers<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> key<00:00:52.350> point

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
building a lot of workers the key point

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.979 
building a lot of workers the key point
of<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.980> strategy<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.059> moment<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of this strategy at this moment is to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
of this strategy at this moment is to
have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lot<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.440> workers<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
have a lot of workers and this is it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
have a lot of workers and this is it
because<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.690> need<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> wood<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.129> be

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because you need a lot of wood to be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
because you need a lot of wood to be
able<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.850> build<00:01:00.180> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> building<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
able to build all the building that you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
able to build all the building that you
need<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
need if there is if you have the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
need if there is if you have the
possibility<00:01:04.199> also<00:01:04.799> build<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.610> lumber<00:01:06.030> mill<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
possibility also build a lumber mill to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
possibility also build a lumber mill to
be<00:01:06.689> able<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> gather<00:01:07.170> wood<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:08.010> faster

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
be able to gather wood much much faster

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
be able to gather wood much much faster
and<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.240> tell<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.750> why<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.110> might

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and I will tell you also why you might

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.980 
and I will tell you also why you might
need<00:01:10.830> also<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lobotomy<00:01:11.729> later<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
need also a lobotomy later on so you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
need also a lobotomy later on so you
continue<00:01:13.439> building<00:01:13.799> your<00:01:14.220> workers<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.970> four

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
continue building your workers your four

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
continue building your workers your four
main<00:01:15.450> buildings<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.020> being<00:01:16.170> built<00:01:16.290> one<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
main buildings are being built one of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
main buildings are being built one of
those<00:01:17.400> four<00:01:17.700> workers<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.720> scouting

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
those four workers can go for scouting

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
those four workers can go for scouting
but<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.320> decided<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> game<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> keep<00:01:20.939> him

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
but I decided in this game to keep him

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
but I decided in this game to keep him
for<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.450> wood<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.320> needed<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.310> be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
for more wood which was needed it to be

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.350 
for more wood which was needed it to be
able<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.350> build<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> town<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.820> build<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
able to build the town so you build your

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.719 
able to build the town so you build your
ultimate<00:01:27.900> ultimate<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> key<00:01:29.189> point<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
ultimate ultimate is a key point of the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
ultimate ultimate is a key point of the
strategy<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.509> without<00:01:30.659> him<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> water

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
strategy because without him the water

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.859 
strategy because without him the water
elementals<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.549> very<00:01:33.000> important<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> able

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
elementals are very important to be able

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.859 
elementals are very important to be able
to<00:01:34.229> take<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> aggro<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> creeps<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to take the aggro of the creeps so you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
to take the aggro of the creeps so you
build<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.409> first<00:01:37.680> footman<00:01:38.009> first<00:01:38.759> pool<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
build your first footman first pool and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
build your first footman first pool and
is<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.720> being<00:01:40.170> built<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.560> more

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
is on the way being built and more

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.889 
is on the way being built and more
workers<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.670> being<00:01:41.820> built<00:01:42.090> also<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> same

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
workers are being built also on the same

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
workers are being built also on the same
on<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> same<00:01:43.619> time<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
on the same time if you can be the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.880 
on the same time if you can be the
lumber<00:01:45.720> mill<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.229> point<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.710> be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
lumber mill at some point it will be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.069 
lumber mill at some point it will be
