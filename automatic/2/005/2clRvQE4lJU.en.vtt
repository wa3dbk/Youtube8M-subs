00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.760 
some access to their attention there I I
don't<00:00:53.460> understand<00:00:54.379> why<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.559> don't

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770

this<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.240> hook<00:01:48.689> shot<00:01:48.899> probably<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.740> going

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this the hook shot probably was going

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
this the hook shot probably was going
out<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> style<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.360> learned<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
out of style when I learned it and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.370 
out of style when I learned it and
they're<00:01:52.710> 19<00:01:53.009> head<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> held

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they're 19 head of things and but I held

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
they're 19 head of things and but I held
on<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.520> effective

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
on to it because it was an effective

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.200 
on to it because it was an effective
weapon<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> underhand<00:02:00.000> free

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
weapon and I think the underhand free

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
weapon and I think the underhand free
throw<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.200> last<00:02:01.409> person<00:02:01.829> shoot<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> was

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
throw the last person shoot it was

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.140 
throw the last person shoot it was

he<00:02:05.300> was<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.570> center<00:02:05.900> he<00:02:06.050> shot<00:02:06.500> his<00:02:06.650> free

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
he was the center he shot his free

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.430 
he was the center he shot his free
throws<00:02:07.040> under<00:02:07.340> him<00:02:07.490> but<00:02:08.180> it's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.390> very

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
throws under him but it's a very

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.690 
throws under him but it's a very
effective<00:02:09.440> way<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.710> shooting<00:02:09.979> here<00:02:10.490> free

effective way of shooting here free

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.480 
effective way of shooting here free
throws<00:02:10.910> but<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.230> think<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> person

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
throws but I I think the person

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.610 
throws but I I think the person
generation<00:02:14.060> they<00:02:14.240> they're<00:02:14.510> very<00:02:14.840> much<00:02:15.200> caught

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
generation they they're very much caught

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.000 
generation they they're very much caught
up<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:15.950> style<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.990> opposed<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.170> substance<00:02:18.650> why

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
up on style as opposed to substance why

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.440 
up on style as opposed to substance why
wouldn't<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.400> cool<00:02:19.700> with<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.970> hook<00:02:20.120> shot<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
wouldn't it be cool with a hook shot I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.210 
wouldn't it be cool with a hook shot I
thought<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.750> was<00:02:20.810> cool<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.500> was<00:02:21.770> definitely

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
thought it was cool it was definitely

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.370 
thought it was cool it was definitely
going<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.760> certainly<00:02:23.540> after<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.960> goes<00:02:24.170> in

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
going and certainly after it goes in

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.120 
going and certainly after it goes in
regularly<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:26.240> will<00:02:26.510> actually

definitely<00:02:28.130> believe<00:02:28.460> in<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:28.910> I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
definitely believe in it but I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.420 
definitely believe in it but I
remembered<00:02:30.440> there<00:02:30.590> there<00:02:30.830> was<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.100> center

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
remembered there there was the center

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.510 
remembered there there was the center
they<00:02:31.580> tried<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.150> show<00:02:32.450> him<00:02:32.510> how<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.870> shoot<00:02:32.990> it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
they tried to show him how to shoot it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.640 
they tried to show him how to shoot it
shoot<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.760> his<00:02:35.480> free<00:02:35.690> throws<00:02:35.900> underhanded

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
shoot the his free throws underhanded

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.980 
shoot the his free throws underhanded
mm-hmm<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.400> he<00:02:37.790> says<00:02:38.030> no<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.420> doesn't<00:02:38.780> i<00:02:38.810> don't

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
mm-hmm and he says no it doesn't i don't

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.540 
mm-hmm and he says no it doesn't i don't
like<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.260> way<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.500> looks<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.200> think<00:02:42.830> he

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
like the way it looks and I I think he

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.990 
like the way it looks and I I think he
was<00:02:44.060> like<00:02:44.330> eliminating<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.800> potent<00:02:46.580> weapon

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
was like eliminating a potent weapon

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.820 
was like eliminating a potent weapon
that<00:02:47.510> he<00:02:47.630> could<00:02:47.810> incorporate<00:02:48.230> into<00:02:48.620> his

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
that he could incorporate into his

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.330 
that he could incorporate into his
arsenal<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.370> he<00:02:49.490> could<00:02:49.670> master<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:51.340> that's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
arsenal that he could master but that's

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.490 
arsenal that he could master but that's
the<00:02:52.520> attitude<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.500> everybody

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
the attitude that they have everybody

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.220
