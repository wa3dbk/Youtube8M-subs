00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.559
 Hi bills 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 welcome back you are with electric like 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 always very much the design a lot 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.170
 often due to some requests from 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.210
 short graphics and interesting stuff 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.250
 I wanted to share with you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 that's why I'm starting to record 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.540
 more or less all the drawings I make 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.300
 covers included so you can give yourself 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.040
 also this other type of video in short 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.730
 since the device is not charged 1 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 I'm talking about speed art like that 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.410
 like that stuff there this is the graphic 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 by step of all you will know 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.219
 exteriors if you follow me you will definitely have 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.180
 saw some videos her face that ever 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 the same kind 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.699
 so the power there the show is not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.859
 a show plus the creative process 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.890
 well let's try to comment on this 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 therefore I work first of all 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 documented I went on his profile 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 facebook and of course I saw a little 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.310
 his photos of his malino took the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.869
 technical writing traced 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.820
 but also with a lot of patience because not 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.659
 I just managed to find the fund 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.479
 despite having long sought 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.460
 positioned below as the request 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 started the sketch of the character who 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.450
 it must have been he dressed with 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.450
 a sweatshirt doing the military salute 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 I always kept looking at the photo for 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 stay as faithful as possible 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.580
 Always, however, albeit giving space 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.330
 also to my style for what I can 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.330
 in conclusion 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.330
 now the hand will seem a bit squeaky 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.860
 how strange but in fact it is not that not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.150
 I liked it as a solution at the end 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.090
 I deleted it I would have done a lot 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:15.480
 of times I have this bad here we are 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 only to the sketch so be a lot 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.210
 fast not very clean and then here is this 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.210
 it is the cleanest part how to revise the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.610
 pencil better define the details 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.570
 in short, those who will come later 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.570
 inked 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 and here we are practically finished 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.930
 the pencil part we will now move to 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.319
 inking are very picky 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.420
 so you will see that I will do it over and over again 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.150
 the same trait until it satisfies 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.810
 here's to all the times that this 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.239
 just a couple that swelled since 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.069
 the shadowy part a very style 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.970
 American as in that castration 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:18.660
 that of dosing the thickness varies it 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:26.849
 stroke width based on volume la 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:30.500
 source of the item added 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:35.090
 some black some nice clear shadow 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.090
 somewhat Marvellian challenge in part 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.690
 to London net of the beautiful heavy cat 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.879
 the experts the codeine 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.189
 always redoing it over and over again 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.840
 same trait because dissatisfied here 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:06.180
 this drove me crazy this 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.180
 piece has done a lot of death 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:22.600
 the shadow of the cord is exaggerated here 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.870
 of the sweatshirt and there are the folds that 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:32.500
 they are pulled upwards since yes 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.330
 raise your arm without exaggerating seen 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.699
 which had to be a very decade 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.410
 clean in black and white just because 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:44.610
 the press that asked me requested 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.610
 a maximum of two colors 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.620
 it seems to me that even on the hand on lost 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.560
 a long time later 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.430
 are remain such if together me 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.979
 I remembered well I did it again with part 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.380
 of the pencil sketch and can hear 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:10.430
 really made a pretty clean hand 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:15.850
 very fine to grow a lot from the cardboard 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.850
 it's simple explain mario I don't know 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.850
 so a lot about own traits 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.960
 because if a trait is done well already 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.810
 more volume to the design then mi 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.229
 like them because you are soaring for i 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.120
 smooth without angularity go I used 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.220
 another tool for making glasses 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.050
 in order not to risk remaining a lifetime 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.830
 since we were already taking a lot of time 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.830
 longer than necessary 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.210
 a little leap forward and let's see 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.410
 where I arrived here we have the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.410
 a2 piercing then 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.619
 eyes always pretty style 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:01.029
 marvelliano that i am renato to see le 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:07.719
 photo because I can't remember if to the eyes 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:10.089
 dark or not this type of eye as well 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.249
 with an inner shadow so clear I didn't 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:16.419
 I remember if I stole it from some soul 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:18.520
 human is wrong in style from in 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.849
 effects you see 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.279
 and here we begin to color the frame 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.519
 of glasses leaving some 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:31.169
 reflected so that you understand the 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.169
 material that is very shiny 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.710
 all this trying to use only 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:42.430
 inking not the color maybe more 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.740
 forward when we will be able e 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.740
 work them also in color 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.810
 these are always very Marvelian hairs 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:03.050
 looks like stuff you want from peter parker e 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.050
 from here very little is missing 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.940
 we are about to finish the job 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.070
 last hair 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:26.790
 you talk about work in hours I think there is 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:29.070
 it took four maybe three without 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:35.210
 counting pauses backward steps that in short 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:38.250
 had to do so here is finally 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.830
 work completed only for you poultry 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.160
 but above all for the sterns I leave his 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.320
 registration linking even though I think that 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:53.670
 you already know this is how much it boils 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:55.980
 he says tiles of the time to hello ballets 

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.990
 this and the cliques or don't forget me 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.300
 leave a nice like or above all 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.010
 some comments especially if you are not 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.550
 still a little bed don't forget 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.550
 write
