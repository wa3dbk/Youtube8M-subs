00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.429
 I want to initially express my satisfaction 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.119
 head of the army military 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.579
 the moment we celebrate the soldier's day 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.119
 day of the birth of louise alves de lima e silva 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.999
 I want to pussy with you 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.080
 servers and unconditional of the motherland 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.700
 of yesterday and today 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.620
 by the dedication by the commitment individual preparation ' 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.340
 and gave great work in maintaining peace and supporting the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.530
 development of our country 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 we must not lose sight of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.500
 that the army does not exist for itself 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.350
 its raison d'Ãªtre is outside the walls of the barracks 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.060
 is where only action is needed 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.540
 either at the borders 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.190
 either within cities 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.760
 in brazil or abroad ' 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.930
 therefore 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.850
 as commander 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.499
 schroeder our army increasingly open to the community 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700
 increasingly exposed 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.990
 and getting closer to our main client 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.700
 It's Brazilian society. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.840
 participate in all initiatives aimed at national 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.650
 which we have been called 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.079
 we will continue supporting the action of the other organs of the public power 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 extending the helping hand to the desireless populations in times of need 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 we want the Brazilian society not only we ademir experienced 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.120
 we want 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.130
 that she knows us even more, and so better give us this force that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.620
 belonged 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.540
 Let's do all this. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 being infection free in compliance with the laws 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.079
 without leaving aside the bullets of the guiding heads of our institution 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.609
 hierarchy and discipline 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.519
 and without giving up arms 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.979
 to the other principles and values â€‹â€‹linked by our patron the tupi de caxias 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.219
 when making all this effort 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.569
 we can not lose sight of the fact that the end of our army's activity is 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.039
 your preparation for war 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.829
 therefore 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.369
 should converge 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.369
 for our training as an armed force 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.179
 the cyclical shortage of means 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.049
 should serve as a stimulus 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.269
 so that the available resources six employees with the maximum of austerity 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.359
 and efficiency 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.829
 thus 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.230
 we will continue to be the institution idealized by the Duke of Caxias 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.859
 the army in the service of Brazil 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.979
 like this 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.889
 we will continue to be 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.259
 you can have the guard 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.939
 faithful soldiers 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.939
 for her to march 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:19.239
 not 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.439
 there 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.180
 air
