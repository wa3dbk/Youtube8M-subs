so<00:00:02.490> welcome<00:00:02.909> everybody<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.689> new<00:00:03.959> tutorial

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
so welcome everybody to a new tutorial

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.130 
so welcome everybody to a new tutorial
concerning<00:00:05.250> bit<00:00:05.520> cutting<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.629> case<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
concerning bit cutting in this case I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.640 
concerning bit cutting in this case I
want<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> explain<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.130> very<00:00:08.790> tricky<00:00:09.510> pattern<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
want to explain a very tricky pattern of

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.459 
want to explain a very tricky pattern of
the<00:00:11.160> French<00:00:11.580> turntable<00:00:12.269> icity<00:00:12.599> genetic<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the French turntable icity genetic and

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.279 
the French turntable icity genetic and
now<00:00:13.710> we<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.969> advantages<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.139> S

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
now we can see the advantages of the S

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.650 
now we can see the advantages of the S
notation<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.220> we<00:00:17.760> understand<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
notation because we understand the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.590 
notation because we understand the
methodology<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.400> crossfader<00:00:20.970> sequence

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
methodology of the crossfader sequence

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.590 
methodology of the crossfader sequence
and<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> record<00:00:22.740> motion<00:00:23.070> pattern<00:00:23.460> only<00:00:24.029> by

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and of the record motion pattern only by

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.920 
and of the record motion pattern only by
reading<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.800> notational<00:00:26.460> indication<00:00:27.390> so

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
reading the notational indication so

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
reading the notational indication so
this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.160> advantages<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this is the advantages of this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.810 
this is the advantages of this
transcription<00:00:31.289> methodology<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
transcription methodology and I want to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
transcription methodology and I want to
show<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.250> example<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> de<00:00:36.660> génétique

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
show this at the example of de génétique

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
show this at the example of de génétique
we<00:00:37.410> see<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.489> YouTube<00:00:38.940> video<00:00:56.690> ok<00:00:57.690> at

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
we see at first the YouTube video ok at

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.069 
we see at first the YouTube video ok at
the<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:58.859> sight<00:00:59.190> some<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.539> oh<00:01:00.750> my

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the first sight some of you say oh my

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.200 
the first sight some of you say oh my
god<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:02.609> he<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:03.090> he<00:01:03.719> plays<00:01:04.880> basically<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
god what does he do he plays basically a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.550 
god what does he do he plays basically a
simple<00:01:06.869> pattern<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.650> where<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.070> fast<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
simple pattern but where we fast this is

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.820 
simple pattern but where we fast this is
um<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> secret<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
um this is a secret so and we see it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.429 
um this is a secret so and we see it
right<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> slow-motion<00:01:15.229> performance<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
right now the slow-motion performance of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.850 
right now the slow-motion performance of
the<00:01:16.890> basic<00:01:17.400> sequence<00:01:17.759> he<00:01:18.479> plays<00:01:18.750> many<00:01:19.530> breaks

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the basic sequence he plays many breaks

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.300 
the basic sequence he plays many breaks
inside<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.880> demonstration<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
inside this demonstration and here this

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
inside this demonstration and here this
is<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.520> basic<00:01:23.790> pattern<00:01:24.330> step<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.049> step<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.650> go

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
is the basic pattern step by step we go

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
is the basic pattern step by step we go
further<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.060> let's<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:29.479> add<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> hired<00:01:30.930> as

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
further and let's go I add a hired as

00:01:31.290 --> 00:02:00.920 
further and let's go I add a hired as
always<00:01:31.710> over<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.579> tuan<00:01:32.880> scratching<00:01:59.719> so<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
always over this tuan scratching so it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
always over this tuan scratching so it
sounds<00:02:01.369> basically<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.729> bit<00:02:02.850> boring<00:02:03.329> but

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
sounds basically a little bit boring but

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.499 
sounds basically a little bit boring but
when<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> play<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.320> twice<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.799> fast<00:02:05.360> like<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
when you play it twice as fast like in

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:21.290 
when you play it twice as fast like in
the<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:06.780> falling<00:02:07.229> video

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.770 

you<00:02:22.300> obtain<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.050> very<00:02:23.410> tricky<00:02:24.160> drum<00:02:25.090> scratching

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you obtain a very tricky drum scratching

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.730 
you obtain a very tricky drum scratching
pattern<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:27.210> what<00:02:28.680> does<00:02:29.680> DJ<00:02:30.400> natick<00:02:31.390> at

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
pattern so on what does DJ natick at

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.520 
pattern so on what does DJ natick at
first<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.920> first<00:02:33.160> advice<00:02:33.520> he<00:02:33.820> works<00:02:34.090> with<00:02:34.390> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
first the first advice he works with a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.090 
first the first advice he works with a
snare<00:02:35.530> kick<00:02:35.800> drum<00:02:36.750> combination<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.770> such

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
snare kick drum combination this is such

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.030 
snare kick drum combination this is such
a<00:02:39.550> phonetic<00:02:40.300> Sigmund<00:02:40.990> like<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.620> here<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:41.920> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
a phonetic Sigmund like this here in the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
a phonetic Sigmund like this here in the
video<00:02:43.530> first<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.740> snare<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.850> kick

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
video first the snare and then a kick

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.900 
video first the snare and then a kick
drum<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.510> direct<00:02:46.900> succession<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.840> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
drum and direct succession like this and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.020 
drum and direct succession like this and
now<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.970> question<00:02:55.480> what<00:02:56.050> does<00:02:56.950> he<00:02:57.160> do<00:02:57.430> with

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
now the question what does he do with

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.990 
now the question what does he do with
this<00:02:58.300> at<00:02:58.920> first<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.130> seized<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> crossfitter

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
this at first we seized a crossfitter

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.440 
this at first we seized a crossfitter
sequence<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.690> now<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.110> important<00:03:03.150> he<00:03:04.150> plays

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
sequence and now it's important he plays

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.280 
sequence and now it's important he plays
actually<00:03:05.790> different<00:03:06.790> types<00:03:07.270> of<00:03:07.600> popular

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
actually different types of popular

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.430 
actually different types of popular
crossfitter<00:03:08.920> sequences<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.150> case<00:03:10.440> for

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
crossfitter sequences in this case for

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.260 
crossfitter sequences in this case for
example<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.190> click<00:03:12.400> flair<00:03:12.640> performance

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
example the to click flair performance

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.199 
example the to click flair performance
and<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.140> one-click<00:03:14.620> Flair<00:03:14.920> performance<00:03:15.670> but

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
and the one-click Flair performance but

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.400 
and the one-click Flair performance but
he<00:03:16.810> starts<00:03:17.470> basically<00:03:18.459> at<00:03:18.700> every<00:03:19.420> sequence

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
he starts basically at every sequence

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.699 
he starts basically at every sequence
with<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:20.950> closed<00:03:21.400> fate<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.180> means<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:23.590> we

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
with the closed fate as it means when we

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.430 
with the closed fate as it means when we
look<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.310> video<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:25.360> first<00:03:25.780> movement

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
look now in the video it first movement

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.960 
look now in the video it first movement
on<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> cross<00:03:26.860> fader<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.820> he<00:03:27.970> opened<00:03:28.450> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
on a cross fader is that he opened and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.729 
on a cross fader is that he opened and
then<00:03:30.970> he<00:03:31.150> go<00:03:31.300> further<00:03:31.600> with<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.350> click<00:03:32.590> for

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
then he go further with the to click for

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.170 
then he go further with the to click for
a<00:03:32.800> performance<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.610> means<00:03:34.019> closing

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
a performance that means closing

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.780 
a performance that means closing
transformer<00:03:37.180> click<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:39.030> then<00:03:40.030> opening<00:03:40.570> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
transformer click and then opening and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.490 
transformer click and then opening and
then<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.870> go<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.459> start<00:03:45.790> point<00:03:46.410> he<00:03:47.410> closed

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
then to go to the start point he closed

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.740 
then to go to the start point he closed
so<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:50.890> makes<00:03:51.160> five<00:03:51.970> cross<00:03:52.510> fader

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
so and that makes five cross fader

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.949 
so and that makes five cross fader
sequences<00:03:53.470> as<00:03:53.620> one<00:03:54.040> group<00:03:54.630> memorize<00:03:55.630> this

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
sequences as one group memorize this

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.130 
sequences as one group memorize this
this<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.380> very<00:03:56.590> important<00:03:57.220> for<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.580> better

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
this is very important for this better

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.490 
this is very important for this better
why<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.170> want<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.860> show<00:04:01.890> right<00:04:02.890> now<00:04:03.450> because<00:04:04.500> we

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
why I want to show right now because we

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.530 
why I want to show right now because we
incorporate<00:04:06.190> as<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.489> record<00:04:06.820> motion<00:04:07.150> pattern

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
incorporate as a record motion pattern

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.530 
incorporate as a record motion pattern
so<00:04:08.170> we<00:04:08.769> start<00:04:09.100> with<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.400> first<00:04:09.760> part<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.360> red

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
so we start with the first part the red

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.350 
so we start with the first part the red
market<00:04:10.900> area<00:04:11.290> um<00:04:12.040> yak<00:04:12.640> what<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.209> glean

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
market area um yak what can we glean

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.690 
market area um yak what can we glean
from<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:14.080> see<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.830> higher<00:04:15.100> range<00:04:15.489> of

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
from this we see in the higher range of

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.810 
from this we see in the higher range of
the<00:04:15.850> staff<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.330> note<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:17.080> 160<00:04:17.709> node<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.310> this

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
the staff a note a 160 node and this

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.820 
the staff a note a 160 node and this
node<00:04:18.880> got<00:04:19.539> an<00:04:19.660> addition<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.080> sign<00:04:20.470> this

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
node got an addition to sign this

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.060 
node got an addition to sign this
additional<00:04:21.400> sign<00:04:21.669> stands<00:04:22.510> for<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> kick<00:04:23.289> drum

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
additional sign stands for the kick drum

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.010 
additional sign stands for the kick drum
yes<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.610> means<00:04:24.820> we<00:04:25.090> start<00:04:25.420> with<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.750> kick

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
yes that means we start with the kick

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:34.140 
yes that means we start with the kick
drum<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:28.680> yeah<00:04:29.680> what's<00:04:30.070> happening<00:04:33.150> we

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
drum and yeah what's happening we

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.110 
drum and yeah what's happening we
searched<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.510> kick<00:04:35.020> drum<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.560> then<00:04:36.190> kick

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
searched the kick drum and then kick

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.780 
searched the kick drum and then kick
drum<00:04:37.420> and<00:04:37.720> then<00:04:38.500> follows<00:04:38.980> our<00:04:39.190> eat<00:04:39.370> on<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
drum and then follows our eat on a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.830 
drum and then follows our eat on a
dotted<00:04:40.650> 18<00:04:41.650> eat<00:04:42.040> own<00:04:42.310> ends<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.880> means<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.810> we

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
dotted 18 eat own ends it means that we

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.590 
dotted 18 eat own ends it means that we
move<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.500> record<00:04:44.830> back<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.910> start<00:04:46.300> point

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
move the record back to the start point

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.250 
move the record back to the start point
in<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.080> lower<00:04:47.380> motion<00:04:47.950> intensity<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.080> now

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
in a lower motion intensity so and now

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.560 
in a lower motion intensity so and now
we<00:04:50.320> incorporate<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.460> crossfader<00:04:52.000> sequence

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
we incorporate the crossfader sequence

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.230 
we incorporate the crossfader sequence
the<00:04:53.290> first<00:04:53.650> symbol<00:04:53.980> uppercase<00:04:54.670> let<00:04:54.880> us<00:04:55.060> see

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
the first symbol uppercase let us see

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.330 
the first symbol uppercase let us see
whether<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.660> bar<00:04:55.960> over<00:04:56.260> there<00:04:56.290> stands<00:04:57.190> for

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
whether the bar over there stands for

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.780 
whether the bar over there stands for
opening<00:04:58.560> then<00:04:59.560> follows<00:05:00.040> another<00:05:00.370> sim

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
opening then follows another sim

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.940 
opening then follows another sim
ballistic<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.390> some<00:05:01.600> of<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.930> know<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.770> this

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
ballistic and some of you know this this

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.210 
ballistic and some of you know this this
is<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.250> double<00:05:03.870> dotted<00:05:04.870> uppercase<00:05:05.620> letter<00:05:05.920> D

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
is a double dotted uppercase letter D

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.570 
is a double dotted uppercase letter D
and<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.790> symbol<00:05:07.510> istic<00:05:07.900> stands<00:05:08.440> for<00:05:09.040> three

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
and this symbol istic stands for three

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.170 
and this symbol istic stands for three
crossfader<00:05:10.210> sequences<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.230> fact<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.790> to

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
crossfader sequences in fact the to

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.560 
crossfader sequences in fact the to
click<00:05:13.420> Flair<00:05:13.690> performance<00:05:14.350> so<00:05:15.090> how<00:05:16.090> can<00:05:16.150> we

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
click Flair performance so how can we

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.990 
click Flair performance so how can we
incorporate<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:18.010> type<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.340> cross<00:05:18.760> fader

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
incorporate this type of cross fader

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.840 
incorporate this type of cross fader
movement<00:05:19.540> over<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.260> record<00:05:20.590> motion<00:05:20.980> like

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
movement over the record motion like

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.240 
movement over the record motion like
this<00:05:21.880> that<00:05:22.870> means<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.350> position<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:23.980> the

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
this that means that position is the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.430 
this that means that position is the
fader<00:05:24.520> is<00:05:24.670> closed<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.360> then<00:05:25.720> we<00:05:25.960> move<00:05:26.200> the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
fader is closed and then we move the

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.560 
fader is closed and then we move the
record<00:05:26.710> forward<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:29.070> we<00:05:30.070> obtain<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:31.300> kick

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
record forward and we obtain the kick

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.350 
record forward and we obtain the kick
drum<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:32.350> now<00:05:32.740> from<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.580> positioning<00:05:34.210> the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
drum so now from this positioning the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.290 
drum so now from this positioning the
faders<00:05:34.750> open<00:05:35.260> we<00:05:35.740> move<00:05:36.040> the<00:05:36.280> record<00:05:36.610> back<00:05:36.940> and

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
faders open we move the record back and

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
faders open we move the record back and
at<00:05:37.840> this<00:05:38.740> backward<00:05:39.520> motion<00:05:39.790> so<00:05:40.330> at<00:05:40.480> this<00:05:40.720> atone

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
at this backward motion so at this atone

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.290 
at this backward motion so at this atone
we<00:05:41.710> incorporate<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.580> two<00:05:42.790> click<00:05:43.060> their

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
we incorporate the two click their

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.750 
we incorporate the two click their
performance<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:44.500> it<00:05:44.560> means<00:05:44.710> its<00:05:44.950> first<00:05:45.250> we

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
performance so it means its first we

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.620 
performance so it means its first we
close<00:05:48.150> then<00:05:49.150> repair<00:05:49.570> transformer<00:05:50.170> click<00:05:50.410> and

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
close then repair transformer click and

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:56.400 
close then repair transformer click and
then<00:05:52.630> we<00:05:52.810> open<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:55.060> what's<00:05:55.600> happening<00:05:56.200> at<00:05:56.350> the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
then we open and what's happening at the

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.700 
then we open and what's happening at the
open<00:05:57.130> sequence<00:05:57.640> is<00:05:57.880> that<00:05:58.780> we<00:05:58.960> play<00:05:59.290> the<00:05:59.650> snare

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
open sequence is that we play the snare

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.320 
open sequence is that we play the snare
as<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.550> reverse<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:02.680> goal<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:04.270> we

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
as in reverse and the goal is that we

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.980 
as in reverse and the goal is that we
are<00:06:04.540> right<00:06:05.140> now<00:06:05.380> at<00:06:05.650> the<00:06:05.830> start<00:06:06.190> point<00:06:06.990> okay

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
are right now at the start point okay

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.930 
are right now at the start point okay
once<00:06:08.650> again<00:06:09.480> step<00:06:10.480> by<00:06:10.630> step
