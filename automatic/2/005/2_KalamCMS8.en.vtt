 You spend the bread on the biscuit. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.920
 roasted and such 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.860

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.150
 if you hate onions just like I do not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.400
 worry that she does not like 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.010
 Onion is the seasoning of our beating so 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.720
 with maxims and do not like me like 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
 line error also contain pieces as well 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 small and here I put 5 spoons 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.860
 mayonnaise 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.420
 almost 6 thousand cuts larger than 250 grams 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.110
 then after a note for you not 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.280
 worry and we will also use a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.390
 blender 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.960
 so let's start is super easy is e 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.960
 will put the corn in here 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:04.140
 coca our onion also like O 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:25.569
 and now the dump in this good mix is 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.569
 so the corn onion and rings 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.560
 Now we're going to hit until we study. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.380
 mix 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.910
 into a homogeneous paste and will 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.910

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.250

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.100
 Candlelight is fine 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.790
 It seems like chat and even those who come from 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.790
 Marketplace 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.740
 As you can see, it yields a lot 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.040
 very very 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.110
 it's like that then in dollars 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.980
 this is the result now our beat 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.720
 so the team alone make a sauce 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.900
 squishy people do not know how much you have 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.760
 they ate but look who likes to hit 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.919
 who does not like green corn in the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.470
 truth does not need to worry because 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.660
 My name is a kiss, but the paper 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.210
 of corn and why the flavor changes 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.820
 totally because of the snow and the onion 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.200
 and he does not like to put this on 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.060
 our great is you get because 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.490
 let the truth ball dislike 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.270
 Onion but does not have weight or taste 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.510

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.090
 so it gets super for those so soft 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.860
 even the totally different temper 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.560

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.810

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.750
 even superfacile yields much I have used 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.990
 side of green corn and 5 tablespoons 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.780
