hey it's Natalie today we are talking
about<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.990> miracle<00:00:07.410> food<00:00:07.770> called<00:00:08.160> sprouts<00:00:08.719> now

about a miracle food called sprouts now
a<00:00:09.750> sprout<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.410> produced<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.610> seed<00:00:11.880> starts

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
a sprout is produced when a seed starts

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.320 
a sprout is produced when a seed starts
growing<00:00:12.630> into<00:00:12.990> its<00:00:13.139> mature<00:00:13.500> counterpart<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.030> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
growing into its mature counterpart so a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.029 
growing into its mature counterpart so a
sprout<00:00:15.630> could<00:00:15.900> come<00:00:16.080> from<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.560> seed<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

going to be pretty similar so the other
