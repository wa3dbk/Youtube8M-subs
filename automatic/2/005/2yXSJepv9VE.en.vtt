00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
I have a really quick method how you can

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.350 
I have a really quick method how you can
create<00:00:12.480> circular<00:00:13.049> text<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.010> path<00:00:14.400> without

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
create circular text on a path without

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
create circular text on a path without
having<00:00:15.840> to<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.379> pen<00:00:16.650> tool<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.130> go

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
having to use the pen tool and go

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.100 
having to use the pen tool and go
through<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:17.730> pain<00:00:17.939> of<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.480> creating<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
through the pain of actually creating a

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.679 
through the pain of actually creating a
path<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.619> begin<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.700> is<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.240> simple

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
path to begin with this is really simple

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.080 
path to begin with this is really simple
so<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.950> do<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.759> blank

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
so what you want to do is I have a blank

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.150 
so what you want to do is I have a blank
canvas<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.900> might<00:00:25.349> want<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.679> this<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> top

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
canvas you might want to do this on top

canvas you might want to do this on top
of<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.400> photo<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.119> simply<00:00:27.539> filled<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
of your photo and I simply filled that

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.720 
of your photo and I simply filled that
with<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.140> color<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.099> looks<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> little<00:00:29.490> bit

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
with a color so it looks a little bit

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
with a color so it looks a little bit
better<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> add<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.480> text<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.949> next<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.400> all

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
this down create your circle now it's

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.929 
this down create your circle now it's
not<00:01:36.110> quite<00:01:36.409> as<00:01:36.710> bent<00:01:37.039> as<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.369> would<00:01:37.549> like<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.909> so

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
not quite as bent as I would like it so

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.120 
not quite as bent as I would like it so
you<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.390> increase<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.799> can<00:01:39.979> make

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you can increase this and you can make

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.219 
you can increase this and you can make
it<00:01:40.250> more<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.729> circle<00:01:41.000> or<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.630> can<00:01:42.049> also

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
it more of a circle or you can also

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.590 
it more of a circle or you can also
decrease<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:43.159> if<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.640> want<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.119> show<00:01:44.149> up<00:01:44.390> on

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
decrease it if you want it to show up on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.260 
decrease it if you want it to show up on
the<00:01:44.990> bottom

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.490 

and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.609> vertical<00:01:51.000> distortion<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
and then for vertical distortion you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.319 
and then for vertical distortion you
want<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.920> ahead<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.969> change

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
want to go ahead and you want to change

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
want to go ahead and you want to change
this<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:55.679> I<00:01:55.710> would<00:01:56.280> say<00:01:57.110> whatever<00:01:58.110> looks<00:01:58.619> good

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
this to I would say whatever looks good

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889 
this to I would say whatever looks good
usually<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.729> bit<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> negative<00:02:00.600> I'm

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
usually a little bit in the negative I'm

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
usually a little bit in the negative I'm
gonna<00:02:01.079> go<00:02:01.229> ahead<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.530> do<00:02:01.950> negative<00:02:02.250> eight

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
gonna go ahead and do negative eight

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.450 
gonna go ahead and do negative eight
this<00:02:03.689> way<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> doesn't<00:02:04.079> look<00:02:04.500> quite<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:05.069> flat

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
this way it doesn't look quite so flat

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
this way it doesn't look quite so flat
I'm<00:02:05.759> gonna<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.060> ahead<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> click<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.719> okay<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
I'm gonna go ahead and click on okay and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.270 
I'm gonna go ahead and click on okay and
I<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.099> select<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:10.160> change<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I actually select it and then change it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.850 
I actually select it and then change it
to<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.970> smaller<00:02:12.330> font<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.989> it'll<00:02:13.140> fit<00:02:13.470> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
to a little smaller font so it'll fit in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.699 
to a little smaller font so it'll fit in
this<00:02:14.459> way<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:15.269> change<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.470> course

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
this way I can change it and of course

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.619
