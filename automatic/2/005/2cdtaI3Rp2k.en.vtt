yeah so they're the kind of apps that a
lot<00:00:32.980> of<00:00:33.100> patterns<00:00:33.429> are<00:00:33.550> used<00:00:33.789> to<00:00:33.940> it<00:00:34.059> we<00:00:34.960> have

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.169 
lot of patterns are used to it we have
the<00:00:35.499> magnetic<00:00:35.980> board<00:00:36.280> on<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.940> refrigerator

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
the magnetic board on the refrigerator

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.450 
the magnetic board on the refrigerator
or<00:00:37.539> hanging<00:00:38.260> somewhere<00:00:38.440> on<00:00:38.679> the<00:00:38.769> wall<00:00:38.949> so<00:00:39.280> this

it<00:01:43.090> will<00:01:43.240> be<00:01:43.359> a<00:01:43.390> good<00:01:43.539> idea<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.899> bring<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.500> to

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
it will be a good idea to bring it on to

it will be a good idea to bring it on to
iphone<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.549> because<00:01:46.060> kids<00:01:46.479> love<00:01:46.719> iphone<00:01:47.109> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
iphone and because kids love iphone and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.480 
iphone and because kids love iphone and
