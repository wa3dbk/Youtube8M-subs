so<00:00:22.830> let's<00:00:23.010> continue<00:00:23.189> unboxing<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.600> what's<00:00:24.779> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
so let's continue unboxing see what's in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
so let's continue unboxing see what's in
here<00:00:25.820> pull<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> tab<00:00:27.240> right<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:29.119> so<00:00:30.119> inside

than I've seen but same thing so we'll
close<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.619> box<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
close this box up so here we have the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.240 
close this box up so here we have the
curve<00:01:17.150> I'm<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.380> stick<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.830> battery<00:01:19.130> in

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
curve I'm going to stick the battery in

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.990 
curve I'm going to stick the battery in
it<00:01:19.930> won't<00:01:20.930> boot<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.290> up<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.650> have<00:01:22.070> a<00:01:22.100> quick

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
it won't boot it up and have a quick

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.140 
it won't boot it up and have a quick
look<00:01:23.060> at<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:24.310> forgot<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.460> look<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:25.820> specs

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
look at it I forgot to look at the specs

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.820 
look at it I forgot to look at the specs
of<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:26.570> anyways<00:01:26.870> here's<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.170> comparison<00:01:27.530> of

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
of it but anyways here's a comparison of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.680 
of it but anyways here's a comparison of
the<00:01:27.950> size<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:28.580> still<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.820> pretty<00:01:29.150> small<00:01:29.390> phone

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
the size it's still a pretty small phone

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.850 
the size it's still a pretty small phone
in<00:01:29.900> comparison<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.300> BlackBerry<00:01:32.300> Bold

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
in comparison to the BlackBerry Bold

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.070 
in comparison to the BlackBerry Bold
it's<00:01:33.860> quite<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.250> much<00:01:34.760> smaller<00:01:35.060> phone<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.570> lot

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's quite a much smaller phone a lot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.450 
it's quite a much smaller phone a lot
less<00:01:36.380> quality<00:01:36.860> also<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:39.470> here<00:01:40.160> we<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
less quality also so here we have the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.650 
less quality also so here we have the
battery<00:01:41.200> there's<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.290> SIM<00:01:42.560> card<00:01:42.590> slot<00:01:43.660> memory

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
battery there's a SIM card slot memory

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:53.560 
battery there's a SIM card slot memory
card<00:01:44.900> slot<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:47.330> battery<00:01:52.240> battery<00:01:53.240> cover

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
card slot and the battery battery cover

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.350 
card slot and the battery battery cover
just<00:01:53.840> slides<00:01:54.050> on<00:01:57.550> so<00:02:00.820> while<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:01.970> booting<00:02:02.119> up

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
just slides on so while it's booting up

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.850 
just slides on so while it's booting up
I'll<00:02:02.570> talk<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:02.930> bit<00:02:03.229> about<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.530> phone

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
I'll talk a little bit about the phone

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.070 
I'll talk a little bit about the phone

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
[Music]

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.850 
[Music]
see<00:02:06.080> it's<00:02:07.040> not<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> whole<00:02:07.490> lot<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.700> say<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.860> if

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
see it's not a whole lot to say it's if

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.110 
see it's not a whole lot to say it's if
you<00:02:10.009> look<00:02:10.160> at<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.550> does<00:02:10.759> look<00:02:10.970> different

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
you look at it it does look different

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.090 
you look at it it does look different
than<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.570> blackberry<00:02:11.930> curve<00:02:12.110> 9300<00:02:12.920> but<00:02:13.070> I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
than the blackberry curve 9300 but I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.320 
than the blackberry curve 9300 but I
think<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.790> modeled<00:02:14.540> after<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.990> 9300<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
think it's modeled after the 9300 the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.790 
think it's modeled after the 9300 the
buttons<00:02:17.660> are<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:17.959> different<00:02:18.200> if<00:02:18.590> you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
buttons are a little different if you

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.740 
buttons are a little different if you
can<00:02:18.950> see<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:20.270> buttons<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.730> they're

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
can see the the buttons here they're

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.810 
can see the the buttons here they're
risen<00:02:23.750> they're<00:02:24.440> raised<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> BlackBerry

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
risen they're raised like the BlackBerry

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.310 
risen they're raised like the BlackBerry
97-90<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.510> actually<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.080> did

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.800 
97-90 I kind of like that actually I did

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
not like the 9300 flat buttons because

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.940 
not like the 9300 flat buttons because
sometimes<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:33.530> were<00:02:35.500> they<00:02:36.500> didn't<00:02:36.769> click

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
sometimes they were they didn't click

it's<00:02:55.370> easy<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.269> press<00:02:56.480> unlike<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.049> 9300<00:03:00.040> this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
it's easy to press unlike the 9300 this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.490 
it's easy to press unlike the 9300 this
is<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.280> camera<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.780> flash<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.260> didn't

look<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.830> specs<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.400> not<00:03:04.580> sure<00:03:04.640> if

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
look up the specs so I'm not sure if

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.690 
look up the specs so I'm not sure if
it's<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.060> 3.2<00:03:05.660> megapixel<00:03:05.690> or<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.709> 2<00:03:06.860> megapixel<00:03:07.160> or

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
it's a 3.2 megapixel or a 2 megapixel or

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.990 
it's a 3.2 megapixel or a 2 megapixel or

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
what's going on in there so it's still

booting<00:03:14.239> up

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
booting up

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.400 
booting up
and<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.830> noticed<00:03:16.220> for<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.460> device<00:03:16.880> with<00:03:17.090> OS<00:03:17.690> 7.1

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
and I noticed for a device with OS 7.1

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.660 
and I noticed for a device with OS 7.1
it<00:03:18.590> takes<00:03:18.770> longer<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.250> boot

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
it takes longer to boot

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.310 
it takes longer to boot
then<00:03:20.330> than<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.320> other<00:03:21.470> ones<00:03:21.710> that<00:03:21.950> are<00:03:22.280> 7.1

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
then than the other ones that are 7.1

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.600 
then than the other ones that are 7.1
the<00:03:24.320> keypad<00:03:24.680> feels<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.160> same<00:03:25.370> as<00:03:25.580> a

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
the keypad feels the same as a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.490 
the keypad feels the same as a
blackberry<00:03:26.060> 9300<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:26.960> honest<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.380> feels

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
blackberry 9300 to be honest it feels

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.430 
blackberry 9300 to be honest it feels
almost<00:03:27.770> exactly<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> same<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.310> comparing<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
almost exactly the same so comparing the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.680 
almost exactly the same so comparing the
size<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.710> it<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.850> probably<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.360> little

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
size of it it's probably a little

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.410 
size of it it's probably a little
thicker<00:03:38.930> than<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:39.860> bold<00:03:40.070> 9900<00:03:40.460> but

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
thicker than that in the bold 9900 but

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.520 
thicker than that in the bold 9900 but
it<00:03:41.480> looks<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.020> little<00:03:42.140> bit<00:03:42.290> thicker

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it looks of it it's a little bit thicker

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.830 
it looks of it it's a little bit thicker
but<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:43.640> much<00:03:43.820> thicker<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:44.420> definitely

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
but not much thicker and it's definitely

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.010 
but not much thicker and it's definitely
not<00:03:44.930> as<00:03:45.080> thick<00:03:45.260> as<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.530> curve<00:03:45.740> 9300<00:03:46.750> it's<00:03:47.750> it's

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
not as thick as the curve 9300 it's it's

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.240 
not as thick as the curve 9300 it's it's
definitely<00:03:48.470> better<00:03:48.620> if<00:03:48.830> you're<00:03:48.920> going<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.130> get

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
definitely better if you're going to get

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.690 
definitely better if you're going to get
a<00:03:49.280> curve<00:03:49.520> 9300<00:03:50.210> might<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.750> well<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:50.990> this<00:03:51.170> one

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.940 

so<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.730> finally<00:03:56.150> booted<00:03:56.480> up<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:57.290> screen<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.830> the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
so I finally booted up the screen on the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.699 
so I finally booted up the screen on the
BlackBerry<00:03:58.490> 9360<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.660> definitely<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.320> lot

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
BlackBerry 9360 is definitely a lot

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.320 
BlackBerry 9360 is definitely a lot
better<00:04:00.980> than<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.370> one<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.030> same

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
better than this one this is the same

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.530 
better than this one this is the same
resolution<00:04:02.690> as<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.140> curve<00:04:03.500> 9300<00:04:04.390> which<00:04:05.390> is

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
resolution as the curve 9300 which is

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.750 
resolution as the curve 9300 which is
expected<00:04:06.080> this<00:04:06.200> phone<00:04:06.410> was<00:04:06.590> not<00:04:06.709> designed<00:04:07.550> to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
expected this phone was not designed to

expected this phone was not designed to
beat<00:04:08.390> other<00:04:09.190> blackberries<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.459> just<00:04:10.670> a

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
raised up I'd like to feel a bit better

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.849
