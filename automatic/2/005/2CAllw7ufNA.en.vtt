00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 Welcome to a class of 12 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
 today I would like you to be there 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.969
 performance difference between usb 3.0 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 and usb 2 come and show usb 2.0 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 was published in 2000 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.740
 however, usb 2.0 is still the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.869
 Most used interfaces usb 3.0 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.960
 was published in 2008 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 There is so much marketing about USB 3.0 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.059
 even now at the time of the video 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.719
 But the question is one benefits 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.550
 really of usb 3.0 connections s.PC 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.469
 before we move on and I give you the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 I would like to show results 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.030
 few very often asked questions 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.840
 answer is it possible we pay 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 times a usb 3.0 stick in a usb 2.0 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 plug in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 Of course, the answer is yes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.699
 USB 3.0 stick will only be in a position 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.070
 the maximum bandwidth of usb 2.0 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.650
 is offered to exploit 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.010
 as we are transferring the usb 3.0 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 sticks be as fast as usb 2.0 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.390
 Now for the second question it is possible 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.290
 a usb 2.0 stick in a usb-3 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 0 connector to plug 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.860
 yes, of course, but because the device in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 In this case the usb stick only 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 transmission speeds of usb 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.840
 2.0 allows you to benefit in this 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.500
 case not from the usb 3.0 bandwidth 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 but it does not matter if it is usb 1.1 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.990
 USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 is physical 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.650
 the connection is the same it is the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.230
 Bandwidth that makes the difference 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.910
 So let's have a look at usb 3.0 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.850
 really worth the money 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.430
 I will post a usb 3.0 and a 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.430
 Use usb 2.0 stick for comparison 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.739
 but 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.140
 O 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.390
 well, we have seen ourselves 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.180
 since a massive difference therefore does 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.239
 proved that usb 3.0 definitely a lot 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 faster than 20 is so if at one 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.730
 the speed plays a role 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.890
 you have to use usb 3.0, so to speak 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.950
 the price difference between the usb 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 3.0 and usb 2.0 sticks is not very 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.110
 large 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.019
 but it comes down to that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.989
 Product the manufacturer and the country 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.690
 By doing so it can be the journey 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.130
 different and that's it, I hope 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.940
 this fast video could you guys 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.459
 help 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.709
