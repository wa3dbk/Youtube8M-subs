you're gonna want like I think I would
say<00:01:48.660> about<00:01:48.869> 4<00:01:49.860> inches<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.640> extra<00:01:51.150> room<00:01:51.540> at<00:01:51.690> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
say about 4 inches of extra room at the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
say about 4 inches of extra room at the
end<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.470> doing<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.770> steak<00:01:52.979> which

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
end so you would be doing a steak which

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.820 
end so you would be doing a steak which
is<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.369> lot<00:01:53.520> easier<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:54.119> will<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.930> require<00:01:55.410> you

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
is a lot easier and will not require you

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.210 
is a lot easier and will not require you
to<00:01:55.950> waste<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.460> much<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.150> baggie<00:01:58.040> I'm<00:01:59.040> going

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
to waste so much of the baggie I'm going

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.460 
to waste so much of the baggie I'm going
to<00:01:59.280> pull<00:01:59.550> this<00:01:59.700> out<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.580> have<00:02:02.880> enough<00:02:03.470> to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
to pull this out but I have enough to

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.310 
to pull this out but I have enough to
put<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.679> thing<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:09.960> point<00:02:10.170> you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
put the thing in so at this point you

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.160 
put the thing in so at this point you
have<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.560> baggie<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.540> open<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.660> both<00:02:12.690> ends

and you have to seal that these fangs

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
and you have to seal that these fangs
have<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> soft<00:02:17.390> smooth<00:02:18.390> side<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.050> sort<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.350> like

a little bit of a in a rough side I like
to<00:02:23.970> put<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.240> rough<00:02:24.420> side<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:26.040> right<00:02:26.220> here

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
to put the rough side up so right here

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.610 
to put the rough side up so right here
there's<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> black<00:02:26.970> line<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.990> says<00:02:28.230> sealing

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
there's a black line it says sealing
strip<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:29.040> pretty<00:02:29.400> much<00:02:29.550> tells<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.150> a
