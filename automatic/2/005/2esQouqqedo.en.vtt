00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:10.980
 This time we use 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.969
 Let's take a look at how to grab garlic. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 If we take a quilt for a long time, 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.700
 The item is painful and the finger tip 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.710
 It's hurting. And then there's even a shoulder wave , 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.529
 I have a minute. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:36.469
 When you do this, use garlic properly to get your hands and wrists 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.469
 I 'll tell you what I'd like to protect. 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.840
 When we do the ring, the students usually have to be sure 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:50.190
 To do this, grasp the look and aneulji 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 I've seen a lot of those who do so much to control characters old mother here 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 I hope you get it here. 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 This way you can get a lot of sweat and comfort. 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:08.970
 But if you try to pull it out and catch it again, 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.220
 Itjyo must also be replaced, because a little uncomfortable to breathe spread evil characters sew this way 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 If you go for a long time, I know a lot of geolro bunch of stocks 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.900
 So if you're a little uncomfortable at first 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.900
 Do not ring in this way. 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.920
 The thumb then the index finger of the cheek and you are using the world 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.660
 So, 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 I'll put my thumb under it, 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.870
 Let Nara stand beside the index finger and stop 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.690
 Take me in a small position 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.750
 You have a lot 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.750
 At first it might be a little inconvenient 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.720
 4 Again for a while 9 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.720
 It is very meaningful. 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:06.740
 Again this way 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.700
 This can be a little inconvenient at first, but when you 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 To you 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.440
 You can prevent a little wrist or shoulder sore for a long time 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 There will be. 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.930
 So once again try Shijo half thread 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.930
 It was a three-way formula.
