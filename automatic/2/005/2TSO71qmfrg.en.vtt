00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.609
 I the people in this one will talk to you about a 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.750
 Batman and superman movie 

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.310
 I previously did the videos talking 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.260
 of this topic you can see them here 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.910
 removing him here so go see them and 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.500
 Well, go and see what was in 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.000
 that moment because this is already 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.889
 updated and I want to tell you 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.199
 that of disc movies and comics of 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.730
 this has not convinced me very much 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.589
 as anxious as Swiss and squash 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.329
 I feel that this movie is very thrown away 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.399
 what with me the colors and it reminds me of 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.349
 a combi reminds me kind of soccer and 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.089
 I know it has nothing to do with rivals 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.130
 with batman and superman I liked it a lot 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.320
 soccer points but could not assimilate or 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.390
 relate that format with seriousness 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.309
 from batman and superman I feel like it says 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.500
 can give much more what is embodied 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.210
 in a committee want to make movies 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.760
 comic type format with these colors that 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.219
 you repeat them and flashy at least for 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.960
 it bothers me to remix the 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.879
 skill the seriousness with a format 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.469
 I do not know if it would make me understand 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.300
 I think you're risking a lot to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.679
 like louis are marvel that is a wave of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 superheroes but they mixed this 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.070
 managing vice comedy deities 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.989
 wants to involve its format as a comic 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.059
 I must admit that the batman suit yes 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.920
 I really like that I think that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.089
 will interpret an excellent batman though 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 also the logo also has the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.570
 I do not know if I'm sorry 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.310
 christopher nolan batman but is that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.109
 I feel like it's going to get very complicated 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.759
 be able to turn your neck if you're a fan of 

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:15.890
 christopher nolan's batman movies 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.600
 to understand the batman costume is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.250
 well ben affleck seriously I hope that I 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.619
 streets my mouth to dpa is my superhero 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.329
 favorite please do not fuck it to henry 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.890
 cavill I see it very blown to see 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.780
 with the superman of less style I 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 it seems a direct sequel to the fact 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.049
 Henry Cavill said he would not call her 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.729
 a sequel what simple fact that 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.229
 they're just going to introduce me to see if I'm going 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.880
 to hear a bit of a sucker but it's that I 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.490
 if it was part of vice comics of the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.200
 Take off chingones would say henry cavill bastard 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.000
 please get off eggs are not 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.069
 strikeouts goes on clear direct sequel 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.959
 it's impossible to cross almost the same but just 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.340
 ironman as he has become old about 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.259
 years now but maintains that essence 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.819
 that is, it is not going to remove the beard of a 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.469
 movie for another because that's the way 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.479
 superman character if you have to 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.340
 impose the hundreds that was used that 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.649
 body in the first movie because 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.329
 evolve to this is the conflict with 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.950
 superman is not a movie we have amy 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.840
 adams like luisa lane is not facebook 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420
 as per white heart lane as martha 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.799
 that in terms like the new album I 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.179
 Say to see how the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.729
 Waterways and woman wonder 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.200
 and that's how we'll see jason momoa 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.970
 of acuaman that's how we see it has 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.890
 loaded will also dry other changes 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.569
 in the case of green lantern and joker 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.310
 of gels these changes are not so 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.040
 official yet and has carried out the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.989
 change of batman and joker I will do 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.580
 to link more film and expand the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.930
 difficult universe that just like that 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.250
 is originating if you applied the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.660
 will try to make your stay a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.400
 conflict with humanity is not a 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.720
 who see him as a false god that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.160
 maybe with the destruction with the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.870
 civilization with what you want 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.370
 apparently superman realizes 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.049
 that is not the only Kryptonian in the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 land and delete channel on the 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.140
 better known as super jr also he 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 will involve in this mind the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590
 civilization of humanity and all that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.269
 pen superman will face the former 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.739
 producer that I can think that out there 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.390
 is going to involve the superior who is 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.250
 like saying hashish and impound them 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.870
 role of ex mourning and is today after 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.400
 both causes that are introducing 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 Other characters like ' Wonder Woman ' 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.780
 eat and then internal green 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.549
 there are bags and aunts and so on 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.470
 change that is talked about the joker's 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.079
 duke is that in his cameo position 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.180
 batman in squad switzerland and they are going to 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.340
 link to connect the movies and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.079
 that you go as relevant and eat 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.400
 as part of the universe then I believe 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.959
 that that's fine said that because 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.910
 I also have a little more buoys and 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.180
 you see any payment they superman me I think 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.980
 as well 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.599
 the reason more card or the possibility of 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.579
 that pay and superman is an excellent 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.079
 movie I hope many movies I hope 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.510
 Shut my mouth, I hope that 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.909
 please and if please, make me see what there is 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.260
 much more than just good raised nor 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.030
 superman extra in the next year 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.950
 then I'm already like to warm up 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.079
 motors please and I'm already anxious already 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.849
 I want to get to have light vice you know 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.980
 if he knows how to make good movies 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.450
 they have to compete to marketing in all 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.889
 for at some point it can become 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.019
 a crossover with mabel that in a future 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.090
 we can see the law of justice against 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.980
 baker that would be great for me I grew up 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.859
 with that I hope but in the cinema I hope 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.870
 that please be a fucking orgasm or 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.459
 something like that I do not know how to call it by the way 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.079
 I have been better known for being 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.489
 director of the avengers movies 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.049
 says they are very excited about the 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.669
 Batman movie and superman 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.319
 individual posters seem very 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.879
 good honestly I think they could 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.430
 have done something better than this of 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.500
 reference as civil war competition 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.840
 I do not know what to call the true since 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.340
 According to witnesses, the strike sees it as a 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 with everything and if you do not like it then half that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.430
 is from amazon yum we would be a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.690
 individio 77 90 by my channel here there 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.340
 a production view if you want to see 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.090
 more videos so the visual sounds here 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.130
 is it so 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.220
 social we do not see in our video but 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.220
 goes
