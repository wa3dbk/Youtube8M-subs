00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
okay right now we're on a port tack and

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.809 
okay right now we're on a port tack and
what<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.290> means<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.279> wind<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.640> coming

tack<00:00:28.980> which<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.730> now<00:00:30.029> where<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> wind

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
tack which we're on now where the wind

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.950 
tack which we're on now where the wind
is<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> port<00:00:32.279> side<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> starboard<00:00:33.930> tack

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.580 
where the wind is on the starboard side
and<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.590> there's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and the way we would do that is there's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.580
