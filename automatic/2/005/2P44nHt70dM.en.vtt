Hi, welcome to CasekingTV.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:17.560
Another topic from King Mod, which means products we change or modify at Caseking.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.480
This time premounted watercooling premounted on graphics cards and mainboards.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:36.360
This means we offer hardware with premounted watercooling from different brands.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.640
Graphics cards brands we offer at the moment are XFX, EVGA and Gainward.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:58.880
On mainboards EVGA and Foxconn. Foxconn we don´t have one online yet.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.400
So what we do is replace the complete cooler.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.160
Then we offer the mainboard with full warranty.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.440
The same applies to graphics cards. Here we have 
 an EK waterblock on a GTX580 from EVGA.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.720
On the front the cooler, on the backside, if available, a backplate.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.720
With warranty seal.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.840
The modification goes as follows, first a full benchmark with each graphics card,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:51.320
Crysis bench at the moment, then comes the modification and checked afterwards for function.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.640
Not with water of course, just a short function 
 test to ensure nothing broke during modification.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.840
Not that easy with mainboards, but we also ensure that the board is working.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.520
Which waterblocks do we use ?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:22.080
On both, mainboards and graphics cards we use 
 aqua computer, EK Water Blocks and Watercool.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:36.400
Why water cooling ? Many will notice while playing or especially on office work,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.720
sure not often using a GTX580 for office, but it is always very loud.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.080
You have a lot of fans inside the case, so quite some noise.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.880
This you can fix with watercooling. You then have the water blocks,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.240
which cool the card, connected to a water loop and a radiator,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.120
which has fans of course, but those could run very slow.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.920
This is the main reason for watercooling. Silence.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.160
Side effect is of course the overclocking potential, 
 which is main reason to most people.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:29.120
With this you can overclock in a nice temperature range.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:40.800
Good hint, warranty. If you buy from us you 
 get full warranty. Not on overclocking of course.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.840
That´s a deal we have with those manufacturers. No 
 warranty if you do it your own.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.480
Some companies offer warranty, but on most you lose the warranty.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:09.160
Important not to crash a 500 Euro card. One mistake and it´s gone.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.440
We guarantee a working card and full warranty.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:31.400
That´s it on watercooled King Mod hardware. See you soon.
