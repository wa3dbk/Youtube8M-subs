00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
opinion is extremely underrated for a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.170 
opinion is extremely underrated for a
player<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.200> scored<00:00:34.800> 14<00:00:35.219> goals<00:00:35.250> already<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
player that scored 14 goals already in

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
player that scored 14 goals already in
this<00:00:36.329> season<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.930> last<00:00:37.890> year<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
this season and last year as you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.979 
this season and last year as you
probably<00:00:38.879> know<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.270> upgraded<00:00:39.750> from<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
probably know it was upgraded from a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
probably know it was upgraded from a
silver<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> odd<00:00:40.770> five-star<00:00:41.250> skills<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
silver and the odd five-star skills and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.069 
silver and the odd five-star skills and
five-star<00:00:42.239> week<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.719> been<00:00:42.809> downgraded

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
five-star week for it's been downgraded

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.170 
five-star week for it's been downgraded
this<00:00:43.590> year<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.070> don't<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.120> about

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
this year I don't really know much about

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.869 
this year I don't really know much about
skills<00:00:45.780> cuz<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.020> don't<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.320> watch<00:00:46.620> him<00:00:46.879> but

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
skills cuz I don't really watch him but

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.760 
skills cuz I don't really watch him but
I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.960> should<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.200> upgraded<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.620> at

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
I think it should be upgraded to at

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.400 
I think it should be upgraded to at
least<00:00:50.039> an<00:00:50.250> 81<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:50.910> she<00:00:51.030> can't<00:00:51.329> go<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.809> 76

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
least an 81 because she can't go a 76

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
least an 81 because she can't go a 76
rated<00:00:52.710> center<00:00:53.160> forward<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.910> 14<00:00:54.510> goals<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
rated center forward with 14 goals in

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.819 
rated center forward with 14 goals in
you<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.890> half<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.250> season<00:00:56.460> um<00:00:57.079> be<00:00:58.079> ready<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> 76

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you know half a season um be ready to 76

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
you know half a season um be ready to 76
like<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.210> should<00:01:00.329> be

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
like that so I think it should be

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
like that so I think it should be
upgraded<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:01.050> least<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.500> 81<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.309> he

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
upgraded to at least an 81 because he

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
upgraded to at least an 81 because he
has<00:01:02.609> talent<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.210> he's<00:01:03.270> only<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.600> young<00:01:03.780> club<00:01:04.049> as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
has talent and he's only a young club as

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.929 
has talent and he's only a young club as
well<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.680> he's<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.189> underrated<00:01:05.880> on

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
well and he's very very underrated on

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.240 
well and he's very very underrated on
this<00:01:06.090> game<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.229> we'll<00:01:07.950> move<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this game I think so we'll move on to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
this game I think so we'll move on to
the<00:01:08.430> next<00:01:08.460> player<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.810> next<00:01:09.990> play<00:01:10.110> is

alive it is only a one in forum at the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.840 
alive it is only a one in forum at the
moment<00:03:01.230> which<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.580> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
moment which I think was a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.670 
moment which I think was a
centre-forward<00:03:03.300> I'm<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:03.990> sure<00:03:04.200> though<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.620> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
centre-forward I'm not sure though but I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.230 
centre-forward I'm not sure though but I
think<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.980> was<00:03:05.100> something<00:03:05.280> forward<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.880> not

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
think it was something forward with not

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.270 
think it was something forward with not
great<00:03:06.540> start<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.930> grades<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.980> know<00:03:08.100> it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
Bundesliga it's a difficult lead to

form<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.440> them<00:03:43.620> starts<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.190> don't<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:44.670> I

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
form with them starts I don't think I

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.370 
form with them starts I don't think I
think<00:03:45.060> he's<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> lot<00:03:45.450> better<00:03:45.570> than<00:03:45.840> mark<00:03:46.050> for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
think he's a lot better than mark for

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.290 
think he's a lot better than mark for
you<00:03:46.950> played<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.190> buying<00:03:47.520> leverkusen<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.120> well

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
you played to buying leverkusen as well

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.450 
you played to buying leverkusen as well
so<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.510> was<00:03:48.600> obviously<00:03:48.690> not<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:50.280> greatest

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
so it was obviously not in the greatest

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.100 
so it was obviously not in the greatest
in<00:03:50.760> fact<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.060> Bayern<00:03:51.360> Munich's<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> brochure

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
in fact the Bayern Munich's the brochure

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.380 
in fact the Bayern Munich's the brochure
Dortmund<00:03:52.680> etc<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.730> should<00:03:54.180> definitely

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
Dortmund etc but you should definitely

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.670 
Dortmund etc but you should definitely
have<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> start-up<00:03:54.990> grade<00:03:55.290> because<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.620> know

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
have a start-up grade because I know

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.760 
have a start-up grade because I know
he's<00:03:56.670> very<00:03:57.060> very<00:03:57.120> clinical<00:03:57.930> finish<00:03:58.230> eyes<00:03:58.560> only

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770

he's very very clinical finish eyes only
got<00:03:58.950> something<00:03:59.220> semi<00:03:59.460> shooting<00:03:59.760> so<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> think

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
got something semi shooting so I think

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.910 
got something semi shooting so I think
that<00:04:00.300> needs<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.690> upgraded<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.770> in<00:04:01.890> my

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
that needs to be upgraded but in my

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.220 
that needs to be upgraded but in my
opinion<00:04:02.160> needs<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.760> be<00:04:02.880> upgraded<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.420> early

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
opinion needs to be upgraded to early

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.580 
opinion needs to be upgraded to early

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
dribbling in my opinion and the next

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.269 
dribbling in my opinion and the next
player<00:05:28.090> is<00:05:28.449> the<00:05:29.169> only<00:05:29.469> fire<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:29.949> this<00:05:30.039> episode

player is the only fire in this episode

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.070 
player is the only fire in this episode
I<00:05:30.580> think<00:05:30.849> should<00:05:30.940> be<00:05:31.060> downgraded<00:05:31.599> might<00:05:31.810> add

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
I think should be downgraded might add

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.249 
I think should be downgraded might add
in<00:05:32.199> Hazzard<00:05:32.560> 87<00:05:33.490> rated<00:05:33.909> that<00:05:34.509> makes<00:05:34.779> him<00:05:35.080> I

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
in Hazzard 87 rated that makes him I

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.290 
in Hazzard 87 rated that makes him I
think<00:05:35.469> the<00:05:35.560> second<00:05:36.039> best<00:05:36.250> laughs<00:05:36.639> linger<00:05:37.090> in

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
think the second best laughs linger in

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.620 
think the second best laughs linger in
the<00:05:37.449> whole<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.659> the<00:05:37.900> game<00:05:38.080> um<00:05:39.360> apart<00:05:40.360> from<00:05:40.479> an

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
the whole of the game um apart from an

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.559 
the whole of the game um apart from an
aldo<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:40.990> it<00:05:41.440> but<00:05:41.680> master<00:05:42.400> he's<00:05:43.000> not<00:05:43.210> it's<00:05:43.419> not

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
aldo and it but master he's not it's not

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.959 
aldo and it but master he's not it's not
that<00:05:43.690> good<00:05:43.900> he<00:05:44.680> genuinely<00:05:44.919> isn't<00:05:45.610> that<00:05:45.729> good

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:45.969 
that good he genuinely isn't that good

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.290 
that good he genuinely isn't that good

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.439 
think is in the normal offline modes but

it should not be in 87 he's coming to

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
that special with my opinion not just

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.399 
that special with my opinion not just
because<00:06:04.060> I'm<00:06:04.240> bitter<00:06:04.479> United<00:06:05.199> because

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
because I'm bitter United because

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.350 
because I'm bitter United because
he<00:06:05.740> was<00:06:05.919> gonna<00:06:06.069> console<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.819> he<00:06:06.879> didn't<00:06:07.180> and

he was gonna console and he didn't and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.209 
he was gonna console and he didn't and
whether<00:06:07.539> it's<00:06:08.110> just<00:06:08.319> not<00:06:08.469> a<00:06:08.500> great<00:06:08.650> i<00:06:08.860> don't

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:09.219 
whether it's just not a great i don't

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:11.070 
whether it's just not a great i don't
think<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.669> personally<00:06:10.569> I<00:06:10.629> think<00:06:10.690> should<00:06:10.990> be

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
think so personally I think should be

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.369 
think so personally I think should be
downgraded<00:06:11.529> to<00:06:11.560> an<00:06:11.710> 85<00:06:12.190> like<00:06:12.520> is<00:06:12.909> a<00:06:13.199> what's<00:06:14.199> it
