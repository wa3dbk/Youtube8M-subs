00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.660
 many submissions and percent also really creative things the ristorante 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 Kupetz asks what do you think that hates the viewpoint of the fans? 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.410
 coherent Zelaya would also be the question on the pictures in general at all 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.839
 Think about it 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.449
 what people are reading about you so read more newspaper accordingly or believe so 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.499
 Percent if the banner 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.499
 all work and one kind influences 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.290
 yes of course you think about it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.950
 in LW Defense one drive or iDefense wine because clearly I think that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 my with not always the best was that of course they are on it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.180
 attributed to that what percent in the tabloid and social 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.790
 was standing 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.930
 but I think that I have turned a lot into this song the program 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 Facts were relativized things also came from the team where you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.490
 said it is not always everything as it is in the newspaper or not 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.670
 always everything as Sven comes over that I was responsible for everything so 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.020
 he used to be the case from time to time i think i was in 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.720
 The probe did not show itself to be absolutely correct and has loyal behavior in the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 10 at the stage where I was out of the team completely and I have to deal with myself 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.160
 also brought in again when I played again then I think that 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.120
 percent of my attitude he has worked that I have not tried around 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.470
 always to hang my head and I try to give everything that I 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 Try around 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.080
 yes always full throttle Mona percent what percent the fans, of course, too 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.450
 and therefore I think that percent my one stood with the fans 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.590
 is not as bad as some might think 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.880
 in order to be quite serious with you there will be very many people offer 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.050
 Cheer up respect the SOEP is a pure one 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.440
 is more competitive 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 Among my fans and the next Festo question is directly to Dr 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.330
 and there is a question from the Karola Fischer and the percent asks mine 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.410

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.700
 would like to know if you had textile lessons at school 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 and if so, if you hated it as much as you do 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.490
 Textile Lessons Gerd percent in my time I was when I was in school 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.039
 recycle 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.289
 Percent, I think it will go in the same direction or around 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.329
 tinkering or even fine art 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.010
 which is so percent of these but textile lessons in the form percent 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.419
 I did not have but I certainly did not like it very much 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.889
 Names such as water fine art and and earns proof of our works percent 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.150
