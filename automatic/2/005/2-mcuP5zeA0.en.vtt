00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
would say i would go to no less than six

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.930 
would say i would go to no less than six
if<00:00:28.650> you're<00:00:28.949> gonna<00:00:29.099> start<00:00:29.490> limiting<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.000> cues

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
if you're gonna start limiting the cues

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
if you're gonna start limiting the cues
because<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.840> tiny<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.469> fast

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because for got really tiny really fast

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
because for got really tiny really fast
and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.280> started<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.690> good

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and then you started it was so good

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
and then you started it was so good
though<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.440> loved<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> yeah<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> balance<00:00:39.180> was

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
though I loved it yeah the balance was

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
though I loved it yeah the balance was
really<00:00:39.570> good<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.930> think<00:00:40.140> six<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.590> still

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
really good but I think six can still

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.460 
really good but I think six can still
achieve<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.129> same<00:00:41.340> level<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.700> balance
