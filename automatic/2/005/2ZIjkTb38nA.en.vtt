particular one we're doing the counter
UAV<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:53.690> we're<00:00:53.960> going<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.140> see<00:00:54.260> what<00:00:54.379> happens

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
UAV and we're going to see what happens

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.529 
UAV and we're going to see what happens
EMP<00:00:55.719> is<00:00:56.719> deployed<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.370> see<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.879> UAV

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
EMP is deployed and as you see the UAV

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.619 
EMP is deployed and as you see the UAV
or<00:00:59.780> counter<00:01:00.140> UAV<00:01:00.320> which<00:01:00.920> are

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
or counter UAV which are

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.980 
or counter UAV which are
identical<00:01:02.629> in<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.930> air<00:01:03.399> blew<00:01:04.399> up<00:01:04.720> so<00:01:05.720> that's

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
identical in the air blew up so that's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.380 
identical in the air blew up so that's
what<00:01:06.170> occurs<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.740> those<00:01:07.100> two<00:01:07.310> next<00:01:07.880> is<00:01:08.030> care

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
what occurs for those two next is care

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.630 
what occurs for those two next is care
package<00:01:08.840> what<00:01:09.200> will<00:01:09.349> happen<00:01:09.770> if<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:10.220> deploy

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
package what will happen if you deploy

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.169 
package what will happen if you deploy
an<00:01:10.849> EMP<00:01:11.330> while<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.929> care<00:01:12.259> package<00:01:13.179> helicopter

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
an EMP while a care package helicopter

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.600 
an EMP while a care package helicopter
is<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.959> the<00:01:15.080> air<00:01:15.229> well<00:01:16.130> as<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.640> see<00:01:16.849> if<00:01:17.179> the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
is in the air well as you see if the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.699 
is in the air well as you see if the
helicopter<00:01:19.610> has<00:01:20.209> not<00:01:20.420> dropped<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.170> care

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:21.709 
helicopter has not dropped the care

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:27.669 
helicopter has not dropped the care
package<00:01:22.099> yet<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.520> will<00:01:23.030> explode<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:26.500> next<00:01:27.500> up

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
package yet it will explode and next up

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.420 
package yet it will explode and next up
is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.500 
is
predator<00:01:30.360> missle<00:01:31.010> so<00:01:32.150> basically<00:01:35.000> my<00:01:36.000> teammate

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
predator missle so basically my teammate

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.770 
predator missle so basically my teammate
told<00:01:37.500> me<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.250> happens<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> EMP

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
told me that what happens is on the EMP

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830 
told me that what happens is on the EMP
is<00:01:39.810> deployed<00:01:40.290> his<00:01:40.770> screen<00:01:41.310> shuts<00:01:42.030> off<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
is deployed his screen shuts off and he

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 
is deployed his screen shuts off and he
cannot<00:01:43.080> continue<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:44.060> control<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.120> predator

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
cannot continue to control the predator

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
cannot continue to control the predator
missile<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.990> basically<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.560> happened<00:01:46.890> there

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
missile so basically what happened there

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.020 
missile so basically what happened there
is<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.370> predator<00:01:47.760> missile<00:01:48.150> fell<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
is at the predator missile fell and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.600 
is at the predator missile fell and
basically<00:01:51.030> hit<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.800> wherever<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.220> heading

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
basically hit it wherever it was heading

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.410 
basically hit it wherever it was heading
and<00:01:54.050> he<00:01:55.050> also<00:01:55.200> recently<00:01:56.010> just<00:01:56.280> saw<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> attack

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and he also recently just saw the attack

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.320 
and he also recently just saw the attack
helicopter<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:59.100> destroyed<00:01:59.580> from<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.910> NP<00:02:00.300> and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
helicopter get destroyed from the NP and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.139 
helicopter get destroyed from the NP and
this<00:02:00.960> part<00:02:01.680> right<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.160> have<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.580> sentry

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
this part right here we have the sentry

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.570 
this part right here we have the sentry
gun<00:02:03.180> being<00:02:04.050> destroyed<00:02:04.350> by<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> EMP<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.430> you

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
gun being destroyed by the EMP as you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.560 
gun being destroyed by the EMP as you
just<00:02:05.820> saw<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.740> next<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:11.450> Harrier<00:02:12.450> I

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
just saw and next up will be a Harrier I

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.010 
just saw and next up will be a Harrier I
believe<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.580> side<00:02:14.790> note<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> precision

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
believe and a side note of the precision

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.820 
believe and a side note of the precision
airstrike<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.640> deploy<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:18.900> EMP<00:02:19.590> while

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
airstrike if you deploy an EMP while

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
airstrike if you deploy an EMP while
precision<00:02:20.220> airstrike<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.090> progress

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
precision airstrike is in progress

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.180 
precision airstrike is in progress
basically<00:02:22.230> nothing<00:02:22.500> will<00:02:22.739> happen<00:02:22.890> because

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
basically nothing will happen because

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.100 
basically nothing will happen because
there's<00:02:23.970> no<00:02:24.920> jet<00:02:25.920> or<00:02:26.340> helicopter<00:02:27.110> hovering

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
there's no jet or helicopter hovering

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.229 
there's no jet or helicopter hovering
specifically<00:02:28.920> over<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> map<00:02:29.459> because<00:02:29.880> they

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
specifically over the map because they

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.050 
specifically over the map because they
just<00:02:30.420> fly<00:02:30.690> by

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
just fly by

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.910 
just fly by
however<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.630> Harriers<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> Harriers

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
however for Harriers when the Harriers

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.460 
however for Harriers when the Harriers
are<00:02:35.100> hovering<00:02:35.280> over<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.850> map<00:02:36.290> shortly<00:02:37.290> see

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
are hovering over the map shortly see

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.850 
are hovering over the map shortly see
what<00:02:37.709> happens<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> EMP<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.269> deployed

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
what happens when the EMP is deployed

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.800 
what happens when the EMP is deployed
that's<00:02:40.860> right<00:02:41.100> they<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.459> follow<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.120> guy

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.059 

all<00:02:45.810> right<00:02:46.049> next<00:02:46.920> up<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.400> emergency<00:02:48.120> airdrop

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
all right next up is emergency airdrop

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:59.809 
all right next up is emergency airdrop
EMP<00:02:50.730> oh<00:02:53.360> nothing<00:02:54.360> happened<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:55.470> wonder<00:02:58.819> all

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
EMP oh nothing happened I wonder all

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.660 
EMP oh nothing happened I wonder all
right<00:03:00.120> Oh<00:03:00.329> apparently<00:03:01.159> emergency<00:03:02.159> airdrop<00:03:02.489> is

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
right Oh apparently emergency airdrop is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.330 
right Oh apparently emergency airdrop is
immune<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.360> EMP<00:03:03.860> next<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:04.980> we<00:03:05.099> have<00:03:05.129> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
immune to the EMP next up we have the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.580 
immune to the EMP next up we have the
stealth<00:03:05.640> bomber<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:07.110> oh<00:03:07.760> nothing<00:03:08.760> again

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
stealth bomber and oh nothing again

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.020 
stealth bomber and oh nothing again
stealth<00:03:10.590> bomber<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.099> also<00:03:11.400> immune<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.909> the<00:03:12.030> EMP

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
stealth bomber is also immune to the EMP

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.399 
stealth bomber is also immune to the EMP
all<00:03:15.030> right<00:03:15.209> next<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:16.769> will<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:19.819> c-130

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
all right next up we will have a c-130

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.180 
all right next up we will have a c-130
the<00:03:22.409> great<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.920> great<00:03:23.239> ac-130<00:03:24.620> attack<00:03:25.620> jet

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the great the great ac-130 attack jet

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.309 
the great the great ac-130 attack jet
let's<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:27.000> what<00:03:27.120> happens<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.780> EMP<00:03:28.079> is

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
let's see what happens when the EMP is

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.339 
let's see what happens when the EMP is
deployed<00:03:28.920> while<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.030> ac-130<00:03:30.659> is<00:03:30.959> hovering

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
deployed while the ac-130 is hovering

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:39.750 
deployed while the ac-130 is hovering
over<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.799> map

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.380 

a<00:03:39.989> little<00:03:40.989> bit<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> delay

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.760 

it's<00:03:47.390> smashed<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:48.140> bits

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
it's smashed to bits

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.170 
it's smashed to bits
apparently<00:03:49.550> all<00:03:50.440> right<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.950> c-130<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.880> not

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
apparently all right so a c-130 is not

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.740 
apparently all right so a c-130 is not
immune<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.870> EMP<00:03:54.340> next<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.490> we<00:03:55.670> have

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
immune to the EMP next up we have

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.790 
immune to the EMP next up we have
chopper<00:03:56.750> gunner<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.290> chopper

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
chopper gunner there is the chopper

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.240 
chopper gunner there is the chopper
gunner<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:02.660> also<00:04:03.110> note<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.710> pave<00:04:03.950> low

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
gunner and also note that the pave low

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.500 
gunner and also note that the pave low
will<00:04:05.860> we<00:04:06.860> didn't<00:04:07.070> record<00:04:07.370> pave<00:04:08.060> low<00:04:08.240> in<00:04:08.360> this

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
will we didn't record pave low in this

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.870 
will we didn't record pave low in this
particular<00:04:09.080> video<00:04:09.230> but<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:10.130> pave<00:04:10.400> low<00:04:10.610> will

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
particular video but the pave low will

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.610 
particular video but the pave low will
act<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.630> same<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.170> attack<00:04:12.440> helicopter

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
act the same as the attack helicopter

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.039 
act the same as the attack helicopter
and<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.490> chopper<00:04:13.760> gunner<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.840> ac-130<00:04:17.049> in

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
and the chopper gunner and the ac-130 in

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.600 
and the chopper gunner and the ac-130 in
other<00:04:18.230> words<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.620> paver<00:04:18.830> will<00:04:19.160> also<00:04:19.459> be

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
other words the paver will also be

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.150 
other words the paver will also be
destroyed<00:04:20.000> by<00:04:20.299> an<00:04:20.480> EMP<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:21.110> in<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.709> case<00:04:21.980> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
destroyed by an EMP and in this case the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.460 
destroyed by an EMP and in this case the
chopper<00:04:22.490> gunner<00:04:22.730> also<00:04:23.360> happened<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> be

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
chopper gunner also happened to be

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.600 
chopper gunner also happened to be
destroyed<00:04:25.010> from<00:04:25.310> an<00:04:25.490> EMP<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
destroyed from an EMP so the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.150 
destroyed from an EMP so the
electromagnetic<00:04:29.330> pulse<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:30.380> successful

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
electromagnetic pulse is successful

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.990 
electromagnetic pulse is successful
against<00:04:31.550> most<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.120> its<00:04:32.300> aircraft<00:04:33.700> except<00:04:34.700> so

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
against most of its aircraft except so

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.510 
against most of its aircraft except so
far<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.660> stealth<00:04:36.230> bomber<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.890> the<00:04:37.010> emergency

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
far the stealth bomber and the emergency

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.130 
far the stealth bomber and the emergency
air<00:04:37.610> job<00:04:37.850> here<00:04:38.060> we<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.330> nuke<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.900> then<00:04:39.050> an

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
air job here we have a nuke and then an

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.240 
air job here we have a nuke and then an
EMP<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.990> see<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.140> anything<00:04:42.500> happens

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
EMP and see if anything happens

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.630 
EMP and see if anything happens
nope<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.510> nuke<00:04:44.720> still<00:04:45.490> hits<00:04:46.490> its<00:04:47.420> target

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
nope the nuke still hits its target

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.400 
nope the nuke still hits its target
alright<00:04:49.640> so<00:04:50.030> we're<00:04:50.240> gonna<00:04:50.300> test<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.930> nuke<00:04:51.140> one

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
alright so we're gonna test the nuke one

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.680 
alright so we're gonna test the nuke one
more<00:04:51.650> time<00:04:51.920> just<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:53.260> confirm<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:56.000> here<00:04:56.540> we

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
more time just to confirm so here we

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.460 
more time just to confirm so here we
have<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> new<00:04:57.440> ping<00:04:57.740> deployed<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.930> a<00:05:02.140> co-op<00:05:03.140> guy

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
have a new ping deployed and a co-op guy

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.890 
have a new ping deployed and a co-op guy
and<00:05:05.320> EMP<00:05:06.320> deployed<00:05:06.950> doesn't<00:05:07.700> cancel<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.720> nuke

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
and EMP deployed doesn't cancel the nuke

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.440 
and EMP deployed doesn't cancel the nuke
will<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.380> cancel<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.950> nuke

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
will it cancel the nuke

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.610 
will it cancel the nuke
no<00:05:11.450> it<00:05:11.600> does<00:05:11.780> not<00:05:12.640> so<00:05:13.640> in<00:05:14.510> other<00:05:14.630> words<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.320> EMP

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
no it does not so in other words the EMP

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.080 
no it does not so in other words the EMP
cannot<00:05:16.100> disable<00:05:16.460> nuke<00:05:16.880> but<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.330> can<00:05:17.660> delay<00:05:18.620> it

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
cannot disable nuke but it can delay it

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.530 
cannot disable nuke but it can delay it
along<00:05:20.090> with<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.430> stealth<00:05:22.790> bomber<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.450> the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
along with the stealth bomber and the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.080 
along with the stealth bomber and the
emergency<00:05:24.290> airdrop<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.370> that<00:05:25.700> basically

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
emergency airdrop so that basically

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.350 
emergency airdrop so that basically
concludes<00:05:26.530> EMP<00:05:27.530> vs.<00:05:28.130> all<00:05:28.370> other<00:05:28.730> possible

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
concludes EMP vs. all other possible

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.330 
concludes EMP vs. all other possible
