00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
because spandex is very sensitive to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.429 
because spandex is very sensitive to
heat<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.659> definitely<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.380> sure

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
heat you definitely want to make sure

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:46.870 
heat you definitely want to make sure
you<00:01:25.680> cover<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:27.000> cover<00:01:27.960> sheet

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.530 

okay<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.689> now<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.260> fabric<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:48.950> place

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
okay so now that this fabric is in place

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.620 
okay so now that this fabric is in place
I'm<00:01:50.540> going<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.650> use<00:01:52.009> one<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.460> our<00:01:52.880> new<00:01:53.150> patterns

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
carrier sheet to hold all the spangles

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.719 
carrier sheet to hold all the spangles
in<00:02:05.450> place<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.080> then<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.979> rest<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.430> right

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
on top of your ribbon and that will hold

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.690 
on top of your ribbon and that will hold
it<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.510> place<00:02:11.930> while<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.380> iron<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.770> on<00:02:12.950> so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
it on place while you iron it on so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.870 
it on place while you iron it on so
cover<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> pressing<00:02:14.810> sheet<00:02:15.050> again<00:02:15.350> and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
cover it with a pressing sheet again and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.059 
cover it with a pressing sheet again and
now<00:02:16.880> you're<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.510> go<00:02:17.900> over<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.530> with<00:02:18.830> your

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
now you're going to go over it with your

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.680 
now you're going to go over it with your
iron<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:21.100> spangles<00:02:22.100> iron-on<00:02:22.580> very<00:02:22.910> easily<00:02:23.180> to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
iron and spangles iron-on very easily to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.170 
iron and spangles iron-on very easily to
spandex<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> very<00:02:24.739> smooth<00:02:25.160> surface<00:02:25.190> that

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
spandex it's a very smooth surface that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.070 
spandex it's a very smooth surface that
they<00:02:27.110> take<00:02:27.380> very<00:02:27.709> well<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> fabric<00:02:29.080> just

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
they take very well to the fabric just

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.509 
they take very well to the fabric just
make<00:02:30.319> sure<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.500> your<00:02:30.769> iron<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
make sure that your iron is on the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.059 
make sure that your iron is on the
hottest<00:02:31.760> setting<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:33.080> use<00:02:33.380> some<00:02:33.709> medium

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
hottest setting and you use some medium

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:49.640 
hottest setting and you use some medium
pressure<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.760> each<00:02:34.910> spot

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.850 

so<00:02:50.400> once<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.239> ironed<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
so once you have it ironed on it is a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.569 
familiar with spangles they are
basically<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.970> holographic<00:03:18.959> dot<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:20.370> has

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
basically a holographic dot that has

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.580 
basically a holographic dot that has
just<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.120> much<00:03:21.269> light<00:03:21.569> reflection<00:03:22.230> as<00:03:22.530> a

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
just as much light reflection as a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.759 
just as much light reflection as a
rhinestone<00:03:23.629> but<00:03:24.629> they<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.930> completely<00:03:25.470> flat

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
rhinestone but they are completely flat

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.539 
rhinestone but they are completely flat
