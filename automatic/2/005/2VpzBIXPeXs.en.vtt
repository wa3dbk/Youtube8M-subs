00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
gonna see that you know until EA has a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999 
gonna see that you know until EA has a
better<00:01:36.329> way<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> capturing<00:01:36.960> their<00:01:37.350> mocap<00:01:37.829> or

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
better way of capturing their mocap or

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.030 
better way of capturing their mocap or
whatever<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:39.590> change<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.829> game

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
engine as far as movement I think we're

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
engine as far as movement I think we're

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.990 
probably was done way early you know way
back<00:02:16.830> when<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:17.160> did<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> virtual<00:02:17.819> play

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
back when they did the virtual play

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.140 
back when they did the virtual play
books<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> these

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
books and all that so some of these

books and all that so some of these
things<00:02:21.390> I'm<00:02:21.600> sure<00:02:21.630> has<00:02:22.020> been<00:02:22.230> changed<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.910> yes

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

let's<00:02:24.450> talk<00:02:24.630> about<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.050> negative<00:02:25.530> man<00:02:25.740> you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
let's talk about that negative man you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.340 
let's talk about that negative man you
know<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.069> do<00:02:26.310> see<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.670> sliding<00:02:27.120> still<00:02:27.390> but

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
know you do see the sliding still but

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.199 
know you do see the sliding still but
like<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.590> said<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.890> really<00:02:29.550> believe<00:02:29.940> that's

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
like I said I really believe that's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.420 
like I said I really believe that's
because<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.990> animations<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.920> don't<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.370> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
because of animations I don't think that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.340 
because of animations I don't think that
has<00:02:32.640> nothing<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.240> with<00:02:33.420> suction<00:02:33.690> and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
has nothing to do with suction and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.310 
has nothing to do with suction and
warping<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:34.950> put<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.340> position<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:37.140> my

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
warping and put in position just my

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.199 
warping and put in position just my
thoughts<00:02:37.650> now<00:02:38.489> let's<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.820> ahead<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.000> talk

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
graphics look good the collisions look

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.190 
graphics look good the collisions look
good<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.560> didn't<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:53.519> really<00:02:54.239> any<00:02:54.360> sliding<00:02:54.930> as

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
good I didn't see really any sliding as

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.560 
good I didn't see really any sliding as
far<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.590> suction<00:02:56.310> slide<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.880> know<00:02:57.030> sliding<00:02:57.480> in

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
far as suction slide you know sliding in

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.290 
far as suction slide you know sliding in
position<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.310> didn't<00:02:59.310> see<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.730> any<00:02:59.850> speed

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
position I didn't see really any speed

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.870 
position I didn't see really any speed
burst<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.840> passing<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.650> saw<00:03:02.310> double<00:03:02.730> hit

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
burst on the passing I saw double hit

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.220 
burst on the passing I saw double hit
tackles<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:05.150> overall<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.480> game<00:03:06.720> looks<00:03:06.989> pretty

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
tackles so overall the game looks pretty

good<00:03:07.440> man<00:03:07.709> let's<00:03:08.130> take<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> look<00:03:08.610> at<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.760> here

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
good man let's take a look at it here

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.370 
good man let's take a look at it here
and<00:03:09.120> I'll<00:03:09.180> break<00:03:09.450> down<00:03:09.480> some<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.959> these<00:03:10.110> things

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
and I'll break down some of these things

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.759 
and I'll break down some of these things
it<00:03:11.010> looks<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.930> sautés<00:03:12.930> path<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.470> ball

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
it looks like a sautés path to the ball

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:21.860 
it looks like a sautés path to the ball
was<00:03:14.310> improved<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:16.760> looking<00:03:17.760> pretty<00:03:17.970> good<00:03:20.870> like

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
was improved it looking pretty good like

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.759 
was improved it looking pretty good like
that<00:03:21.900> consecutive<00:03:22.500> hit<00:03:22.860> right<00:03:23.070> there<00:03:24.769> man

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
that consecutive hit right there man

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.789 
that consecutive hit right there man
here's<00:03:26.070> one<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.489> negatives<00:03:27.620> watch<00:03:28.620> this

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
here's one of the negatives watch this

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.340 
here's one of the negatives watch this
Lobby<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:30.000> how<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.299> kind<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.570> shifts<00:03:30.930> over<00:03:31.200> to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
Lobby see how it kind of shifts over to

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.440 
Lobby see how it kind of shifts over to
that<00:03:31.470> title<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.120> look<00:03:33.299> it's

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
that title you know it's a look it's

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.690 
that title you know it's a look it's
minimal<00:03:33.930> not<00:03:34.320> as<00:03:34.470> bad<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:34.980> before<00:03:35.250> but

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
minimal not as bad as it was before but

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.240 
minimal not as bad as it was before but
like<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:35.970> said<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:37.110> know<00:03:37.290> those<00:03:37.860> little<00:03:38.100> things

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
like I said you know those little things

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.460 
like I said you know those little things
looks<00:03:38.820> like<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.209> still<00:03:39.450> might<00:03:39.720> be<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:40.200> but

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
looks like it still might be there but

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.600 
looks like it still might be there but
overall<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.660> don't<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.610> too

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
overall you know I don't really see too

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.930 
overall you know I don't really see too
