00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.199
 very good and minecraft bearers but 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.390
 one called pro comfortable for minecraft 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.369
 1.8 works with forging so I'm not going to 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.840
 let's see what a bowl is that adds 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.150
 a series of skills good a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.250
 skill rather said to weapons when 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.740
 we are pasting in this case is going to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.929
 work with the swords with the picks 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.429
 with axes and shovels because 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.660
 by the fact that when 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.309
 we selected I'm going to put myself here in the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 chest to which he now taught a little 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.760
 it's better when we select it 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.650
 the attack damage comes out as you are seeing 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.230
 so then the mode in this way is 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.180
 as he detects that this is a weapon although 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.250
 be a tool in this case in this 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 case the arcs are not going to work and I 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.549
 that I know a stick for example is not going to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.890
 work but it will work 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.440
 the four weapons that has been said is worth the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.140
 sword the shovel the pick and the ax in 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.939
 this case must be named after 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.309
 the ones that I'm going to teach you can be valid 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:03.100
 the name sleep a blade can be 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.720
 coli blade can be like bringer edward 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.869
 bell also respecting the capitals and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.640
 the lowercase and cos tom baker start of 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.140
 the field or scalise 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.290
 in this case as I am also seeing 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.850
 it works or not you do not see why put a 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.000
 peak and does not teach anything yet but good 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.430
 in the peak I'm going to put 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.180
 this back that puts holy blade and I do not know 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.200
 how does ballet work in this case when 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.880
 attack any entity by 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.010
 say let's say zombies and we start 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 kill them we will gain this effect of 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.580
 start attacking the zombies you are going to see 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.020
 it's worth it in this case when it reaches 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.660
 kill him as you see the little stars come out 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.790
 of villager and as you see we started to kill 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.460
 to the zombies in one fell swoop we have 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 speed 2 force x and absorption in this 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.490
 case then as it was in that creative no 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 he has seen the absorption that he had but 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 Now we're going to try it, I'll go 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.200
 to put a lot of zombies around here 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.460
 and today I will go back again to go but 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 this time with the sword as you are 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.720
 seeing with the peak worked so 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.670
 now let's see it we will see it a little bit 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.140
 it's better to go attack the zombies and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.119
 you are going to see what's worth it guys there's a moment 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.250
 that we have a zombie, let's give it 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.660
 ok is that I'm in your rival that I do 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.310
 I 'm worth you guys how are you living 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.560
 we have or my god how much absorption or 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.260
 how much partner that has also lowered us 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.570
 as we are updating this effect 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.700
 how are we attacking him as you see the 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.200
 society is regenerated therefore we 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.740
 we come to die this is a pass 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.170
 I'm sitting too good 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.550
 and nothing the absorption lasts long so 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.530
 both once we have finished 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.970
 attack yet we get to last a few 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.160
 how many seconds is enough 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.690
 well by the way, I have to say that I'm 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.320
 Trying a surf for me 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.810
 created a basic subscriber that good 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.180
 in this case, it is like this is a pack that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.390
 is one of your pvp pack that only 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.070
 change the inventory hub and what 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.160
 makes transparent apart from putting me here 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.930
 my image and down more serious in its way 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.150
 that the truth that is quite curious 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.740
 I will not leave it for the moment and I 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.050
 I think it's pretty cool besides this 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.850
 I think it's a disco here in Mexico 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.830
 it's cool so guys this is the 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 world we have nothing else is a mod cortito 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.850
 I know but it 's a good way 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.410
 add these little things you guys have these 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.330
 names and you put these names to these 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.160
 weapons or tools you have that 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.540
 skill that remains sedated but that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.190
 sure that some will interest you 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.470
 put it on your game because it's very 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.470
 difficult have many enemies and so on 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 etcetera is worth guys so nothing 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.010
 favorites 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.010
 see you later
