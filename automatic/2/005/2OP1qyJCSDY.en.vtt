00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.939
 event of the publisher and I 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.549
 I was very curious for the law they 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.159
 They sent us by surprise so we'll see 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.650

 trilogy at last is a selection more books 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.530
 only maybe they are independent by the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 that I understood and he is national and also 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.939
 they sent the persuasion of the genial team 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.409
 that I am very much in order to read because it is 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.170
 about her book, right? 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.850
 that is, you can guess what it is but I am 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.189
 very anxious to see that this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.990
 Your new books are beautifully edited. 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.140
 and now show the books that I line 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 I like it, I did not read much. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 when you were that hangover 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.140
 literary anyway is was the first of the year 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.430
 I thought I would not have this year but she 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.740
 always catches me 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.980
 so I was about 20 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.200
 the days like those in reading a little 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.060
 not then it very little does not conclude 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.920
 Nothing in the first 20 days I do not know 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.510
 how many pages I read but I'll show 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.890
 for you more or less I read this 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.890
 here in August, which is the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.460
 book 20 thousand and 20 thousand leagues underwater 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.770
 Wow, now I'm done, I'm not finished. 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.450
 I think it ends this month. 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.200
 I do not know, I need to get it because now 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.450
 I left a little aside and I finished the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.220
 james joyce hôtel movie 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.100
 only I have not done the drawing because 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.770
 I wanted to read the author's dublinenses too 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.170
 that I already had here so I'm reading in the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.610
 moment there was also a few short stories 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.380
 because it's a book to get some 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.180
 points in the month of August and now I am 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.270
 concluding right 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.420
 It's to be able to do the review together 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.640
 You came to the final there and I think 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.250
 oab did not give me install it as soon as I 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.440
 made me start reading the books I 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.410
 Then I bought the first one I read 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.270
 It was because in the day John is danilo 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.950
 leonard I need to sometimes still 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.980
 I do not have but I will do it 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.610
 and also looked at lakes is this book I 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.750
 I think I read from the 30th to the 31st, but I 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.810
 I consider that in the month of August 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.350
 because I think about 250 pages only one 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.520
 Then there was another 30 to the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.040
 second good 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.420
 This is what I read I received with 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.640
 August I hope you have 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.730
