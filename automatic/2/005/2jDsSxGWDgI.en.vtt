00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.190
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:11.129
 how to modify and how to shape the game 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.719
 of minecraft for if you know how two ago 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.970
 weeks we had a naval update 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.190
 way 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.380
 it prevents us from duplicating good if we can 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.210
 double but it is a hard way 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.890
 it's suddenly not coming out it 's very difficult 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.439
 get the containers and all that 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.570
 well this way it will be very simple is 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.210
 very easy to do no more is necessary 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.349
 follow my steps take less than five 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.500
 minutes even if we start 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.910
 the first thing they should have 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.910
 and we also noticed the game 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.370
 as I have my saved game 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.530
 here is a file byol if they are fixed here 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 are the departure of america the 360 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.130
 my channel or let's start 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.170
 the first first that we say do 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.310
 we are going to have to install this program 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.200
 does not weigh as much weighs 80 800 kilobytes and it 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.260
 they ask for the procedure very quickly and 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.430
 installs to pay ok to open the 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.510
 we have seen starting 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.120
 in the dance 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.930
 I get sive 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.930
 silver 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.859
 although here is the part of the mesh 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.859
 black ok we extract it 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.830
 as here here is the game I have 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.800
 another game but if they are fixed then that 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.330
 I'm not interested in heading 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.920
 What we need to do is remove 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.580
 the nothing game for you to check 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.580
 how is everything 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.490
 and then in one case I will then be in the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.560
 local 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.549
 ok and once also sometimes 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.360
 extracted the second thing that is the xbox 360 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.360
 revolution 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.490
 we have to charge if you look this 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.710
 suddenly you can leave for turin 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.840
 nor so sign up on the page when 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.710
 you chose 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.710
 the case 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.510
 action 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.620
 the victor will put you color 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.930
 game &amp; watch 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.930
 then they go to the m where it is handled 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.520
 we put you click open dance look for your 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.010
 starting where they left 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.460
 in my case I told him on my desk 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.460
 we have to load 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.730
 that is loading a 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.540
 the departure of fact although if they are fixed 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.060
 I have the container full and I put the 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.400
 container full of tmt there is a world 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.760
 gold diamonds 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.970
 of all those diamond blocks and they are fixed 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.920
 Well, in my case, I 'm not going to fill 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.450
 the objects there is a list of recipes 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.180
 here 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.090
 I'm not interested in the first one that I'm going to 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.170
 do I 'm going to put you here 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.780
 right click I put max there are items if 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.650
 tell yourself all the items that they had 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.590
 you become 64 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.239
 ok instead some objects do not 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.879
 they work that there are many objects that 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.030
 they can put diamond and all that but 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.580
 some do not work 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.710
 in my case I have the 64 that 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.880
 needed 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.880
 I put him father 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.830
 and here you have already saved it enough 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.810
 I close it 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.800
 and now more processing but at 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.870
 reverse 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.870
 although what we are going to do to luismi 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.859
 in my case I have already saved 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.570
 they are going to erase this game 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.880
 and they're going to put in the other one that was new 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.880
 and here ends the video tutorial 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.249
 well then it 's a very simple way 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.929
 and quick to do 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:36.399
 flat what they want they have containers 

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.869
 is a simpler and faster way to 

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.909
 make you walk doubling and walking 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:42.729
 battling that you miss the 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:44.649
 objects or the container is lost is a 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.299
 very fast way decided because and that 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:48.299
 It's all and we waited until the next
