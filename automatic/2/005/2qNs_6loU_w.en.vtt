00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
just to be used as an ice bucket but we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
just to be used as an ice bucket but we
decided<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.609> turn<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.910> into<00:00:21.029> something<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
decided to turn it into something a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.750 
decided to turn it into something a
little<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:21.930> nicer<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.390> here<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:25.460> ok<00:00:27.109> now

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
little bit nicer so here it is ok now

little bit nicer so here it is ok now
take<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:29.939> bit<00:00:30.090> about<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.570> did<00:00:30.750> ok

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.450 
take a little bit about what we did ok
this<00:00:32.579> thing<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> heavy<00:00:33.090> well<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.899> again

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
this thing is heavy well this is again

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.569 
this thing is heavy well this is again
solid<00:00:35.460> crystal<00:00:36.000> ok<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.710> carved<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> leaves

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
solid crystal ok we carved the leaves

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
solid crystal ok we carved the leaves
this<00:00:39.210> isn't<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> great<00:00:39.660> pattern<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.260> carved<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this isn't a great pattern we carved the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
this isn't a great pattern we carved the
leaves<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> top<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.809> shaded

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
leaves out of the top and then we shaded

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
leaves out of the top and then we shaded
the<00:00:43.440> grapes<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> bottom<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.450> hopefully

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the grapes at the bottom so hopefully

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
the grapes at the bottom so hopefully
you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.469> look<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> know

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you can get a good look at that I know

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.790 
you can get a good look at that I know
that<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.420> exactly<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> best<00:00:49.410> way<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that this is not exactly the best way to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.630 
that this is not exactly the best way to
do<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.629> hey<00:00:51.629> doing<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> best<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.640> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
do this but hey doing the best we can so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520

you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.480> hopefully<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.350> see

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you can see that hopefully you can see

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
you can see that hopefully you can see
it's<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:55.829> thick<00:00:56.430> ok<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> glass<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.370> very

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's very thick ok the glass is very

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's very thick ok the glass is very
thick<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:01.379> leaves<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.920> deep<00:01:02.100> carved<00:01:02.579> on

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
thick and the leaves are deep carved on

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
thick and the leaves are deep carved on
the<00:01:02.789> outside<00:01:03.180> again<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> deep<00:01:03.899> carved<00:01:04.379> leaves

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the outside again we deep carved leaves

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
the outside again we deep carved leaves
and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.610> veins<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.119> left<00:01:06.330> raised<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> clear

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
and the veins we left raised and clear

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
and the veins we left raised and clear
and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> grapes<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:10.880> shaded<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and then the grapes are shaded so you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.140 
and then the grapes are shaded so you
have<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> shadowing<00:01:13.200> effect<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.729> only

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
have the shadowing effect now we only

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
have the shadowing effect now we only
carve<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.080> side<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.799> I'll<00:01:16.890> tell<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
carve this on one side and I'll tell you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
carve this on one side and I'll tell you
why<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.780> other<00:01:18.930> side<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.619> blank<00:01:19.950> ok<00:01:20.850> now

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
why is the other side is blank ok now

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.440 
why is the other side is blank ok now
but<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> reason<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.070> did<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.090> if

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but the reason we did that is so that if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
but the reason we did that is so that if
for<00:01:24.840> example<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> great

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
for example this would be a great

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.020 
for example this would be a great
wedding<00:01:27.150> or<00:01:27.479> anniversary<00:01:27.600> gift<00:01:28.759> or<00:01:29.759> something

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
wedding or anniversary gift or something

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.210 
wedding or anniversary gift or something
like<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.560> we<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.770> monitor<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.759> do

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
like that we can monitor you can do

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.120

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
monogram ok can do a monogram on the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.660 
monogram ok can do a monogram on the
other<00:01:38.369> side<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> glass<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.189> way<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
other side of the glass so that way you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
other side of the glass so that way you
can<00:01:41.880> personalize<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.600> now<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> love<00:01:43.860> your

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
think that we should go ahead and carve

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.580 
think that we should go ahead and carve
this<00:01:48.750> pattern<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.500> both<00:01:49.950> sides<00:01:50.840> ok<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.560> should

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this pattern on both sides ok or should

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
this pattern on both sides ok or should
we<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.070> leave<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.579> side<00:01:53.850> blank<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we just leave this side blank so they

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.090 
we just leave this side blank so they
can<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> personalized<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:58.100> would

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
again this is kind of a combination of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.889 
again this is kind of a combination of
art<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.860> again<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.069> functional<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
art and again it's functional we like to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.920 
art and again it's functional we like to
have<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> way

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
I'll be able to create some pieces that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.980 
I'll be able to create some pieces that
aren't<00:02:13.550> functional<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.150> are<00:02:14.270> just<00:02:14.630> complete

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
aren't functional that are just complete
