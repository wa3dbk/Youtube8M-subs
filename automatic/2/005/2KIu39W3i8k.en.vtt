you another video review this time we're
taking<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.340> look<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.670> protoform<00:00:12.360> asteroid

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
taking a look at protoform asteroid

is<00:00:17.300> colored<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.539> poop<00:00:19.140> brown<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:21.410> really<00:00:22.410> wish<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
is colored in poop brown I really wish I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800 
is colored in poop brown I really wish I
could<00:00:22.920> say<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.029> another<00:00:24.210> color<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.660> it's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
could say it's another color but it's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410 
could say it's another color but it's
Pope<00:00:25.080> Brown<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.609> does<00:00:26.789> not<00:00:26.820> mean<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
Pope Brown but that does not mean it's a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
Pope Brown but that does not mean it's a
bad<00:00:27.539> figure<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:29.070> other<00:00:29.220> colors<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> are

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
bad figure the other colors that are

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.870 
bad figure the other colors that are
shown<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.779> silver<00:00:31.769> highlights<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.669> some

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
shown are silver highlights in some

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.049 
shown are silver highlights in some
areas<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> red<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.890> black

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
areas and red and a little bit of black

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.549 
areas and red and a little bit of black
the<00:00:36.059> figure<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.420> highly<00:00:36.780> detailed<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the figure is highly detailed it is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.040 
the figure is highly detailed it is
definitely<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:40.850> normal<00:00:41.850> asteroid<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.629> any

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
definitely not a normal asteroid by any

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
definitely not a normal asteroid by any
means<00:00:45.320> other<00:00:46.320> than<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.800> might<00:00:47.460> bring<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
means other than that might bring it a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
means other than that might bring it a
little<00:00:47.850> closer<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.399> mean<00:00:50.399> it's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
little closer here for you I mean it's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.760 
little closer here for you I mean it's
not<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.789> figure<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.960> definitely

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
not that figure at all it's definitely

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
not that figure at all it's definitely
different<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
different and I actually like this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
different and I actually like this
asteroid<00:00:55.170> mode<00:00:55.469> better<00:00:55.739> than<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
asteroid mode better than I like the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.240 
asteroid mode better than I like the
optimus<00:00:56.910> prime<00:00:57.180> asteroid<00:00:57.780> mode<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:59.010> think

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
optimus prime asteroid mode I just think

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.420 
optimus prime asteroid mode I just think
it<00:00:59.399> looks<00:00:59.730> more<00:01:00.030> alien<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:01.079> Prime's<00:01:01.980> his

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it looks more alien than Prime's his

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.660 
it looks more alien than Prime's his
looks<00:01:02.640> more<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.589> semi<00:01:04.589> crossed<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
looks more like a semi crossed with a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
looks more like a semi crossed with a
well<00:01:06.240> rock<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.840> but<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.290> mode<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
well rock so but I like this mode it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.490 
well rock so but I like this mode it
definitely<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.850> plain<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
definitely is plain like with the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980 
definitely is plain like with the
turbines<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> front<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.840> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
turbines here in the front and then it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
turbines here in the front and then it's
got<00:01:16.170> its<00:01:16.729> jet<00:01:17.729> stream<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.720> also

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
got its jet stream thing but it's also

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.130 
got its jet stream thing but it's also
got<00:01:19.170> wings<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.509> fold

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
got wings and if you want you can fold

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
got wings and if you want you can fold
these<00:01:22.530> wings<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> side<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> feel

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
these wings out on the side if you feel

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.050 
these wings out on the side if you feel
like<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.350> got<00:01:25.500> wings<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> here

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
like it and it's got wings here and here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
like it and it's got wings here and here
I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> keep<00:01:28.229> those<00:01:28.439> wings<00:01:28.650> tucked

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I just want to keep those wings tucked

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.179 
I just want to keep those wings tucked
in<00:01:29.130> though<00:01:29.810> but<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.530> also<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.829> wheels<00:01:32.070> on

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
in though but it's also got wheels on

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.990 
in though but it's also got wheels on
the<00:01:32.310> bottom<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.970> roll<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.670> let's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the bottom so you can roll it but let's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.550 
the bottom so you can roll it but let's
go<00:01:36.090> ahead<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> transform<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> first

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
go ahead and transform it now the first

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
go ahead and transform it now the first
thing<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
thing we have to do is just take the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.350 
thing we have to do is just take the
unit<00:01:39.689> per<00:01:40.140> ticket<00:01:40.409> holder<00:01:41.189> legs<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
unit per ticket holder legs down and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
unit per ticket holder legs down and
then<00:01:42.720> swing<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> entire<00:01:43.350> assembly<00:01:44.159> around

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
then swing the entire assembly around

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
then swing the entire assembly around
like<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.780> you've<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
like that so you've got them kind of a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.389 
like that so you've got them kind of a
sitting<00:01:47.640> Rock<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
sitting Rock then what I like to do is I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
sitting Rock then what I like to do is I
go<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.540> kind<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> pull<00:01:51.930> up

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
go up in here and just kind of pull up

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
go up in here and just kind of pull up
the<00:01:52.170> gun<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.540> actually<00:01:54.540> unlike

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the gun now that going actually unlike

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990 
the gun now that going actually unlike
primes<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> projectile<00:01:56.130> attached<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
primes has a projectile attached and you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
primes has a projectile attached and you
just<00:01:57.149> pull<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> flame<00:01:57.780> off<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> projectile

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
just pull the flame off the projectile

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.190 
just pull the flame off the projectile
does<00:01:59.790> fire<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.780> holding<00:02:01.079> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
does fire and I was just holding it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.260 
does fire and I was just holding it
there<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:03.740> projectile<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.250> poop<00:02:05.759> Brown<00:02:06.060> as

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there the projectile is in poop Brown as

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.650 
there the projectile is in poop Brown as
well

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.370 

so<00:02:09.260> we'll<00:02:09.890> take<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.100> look<00:02:10.280> at<00:02:10.370> the<00:02:10.430> figure<00:02:10.730> now

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
so we'll take a look at the figure now

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.470 
so we'll take a look at the figure now
and<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.590> get<00:02:12.860> our<00:02:12.980> my<00:02:13.640> nail<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and we just get our my nail in here and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.890 
and we just get our my nail in here and
pop<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:14.720> off<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.650> lift<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.810> then

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
pop that off and lift it up and then

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470 
pop that off and lift it up and then
fold<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.260> down<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.030> straighten<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> legs<00:02:20.300> out

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
fold it down and straighten the legs out

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870 
fold it down and straighten the legs out
and<00:02:20.690> put<00:02:20.810> them<00:02:20.900> down<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.440> then<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.760> come<00:02:22.760> in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
and put them down and then you come in

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.330 
and put them down and then you come in
here<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.390> unfold<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.020> feet<00:02:27.130> when<00:02:28.130> you're

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
here and you unfold the feet when you're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.670 
here and you unfold the feet when you're
supposed<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.730> unfold<00:02:29.060> feet<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.110> figure<00:02:31.100> man

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
supposed to unfold feet but I figure man

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.030 
supposed to unfold feet but I figure man
it<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.970> tight<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.360> times<00:02:35.690> I'm<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.440> sure<00:02:36.740> why

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it is tight at times I'm not sure why

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.120 
it is tight at times I'm not sure why
it's<00:02:37.250> doing<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.700> right<00:02:38.030> now<00:02:38.830> tight<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> few

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
it's doing this right now tight a few

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.950 
it's doing this right now tight a few
minutes<00:02:40.400> ago<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:44.210> we<00:02:44.240> just<00:02:44.330> fold<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.810> feet

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
minutes ago and we just fold the feet

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.570 
minutes ago and we just fold the feet
out<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:47.090> hip<00:02:48.050> joint<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.710> him<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.430> on

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
out now this hip joint on him and on

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.060 
out now this hip joint on him and on
prime<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.090> very<00:02:50.450> loose<00:02:51.050> but<00:02:51.740> all<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> other

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
prime is very loose but all the other

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.140 
prime is very loose but all the other
joints<00:02:52.460> are<00:02:52.550> pretty<00:02:52.760> tight<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:54.440> take<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.740> arms

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
joints are pretty tight we take the arms

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.850 
joints are pretty tight we take the arms
and<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.270> unhook<00:02:56.810> them<00:02:56.990> and<00:02:57.290> just<00:02:57.470> push<00:02:57.710> that

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
and we unhook them and just push that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.250 
and we unhook them and just push that
down<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.690> take<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> back<00:03:00.230> part

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
down and I like to take the back part

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.880 
down and I like to take the back part
and<00:03:01.070> move<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.960> move<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.470> arms<00:03:03.770> out

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
and move that up and move the arms out

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.300 
and move that up and move the arms out
and<00:03:04.130> ho<00:03:04.370> look<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.300> head<00:03:05.510> pops<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:06.130> do<00:03:07.130> that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
and ho look the head pops up do that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.110 
and ho look the head pops up do that
again<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.210> see<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.830> little<00:03:09.830> closer<00:03:10.190> yes

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
again so you can see a little closer yes

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.180 
again so you can see a little closer yes
this<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.450> Auto<00:03:11.690> morph<00:03:12.050> technology<00:03:12.680> right<00:03:12.890> here

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
this is Auto morph technology right here

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.830 
this is Auto morph technology right here
ah<00:03:15.430> let<00:03:16.430> me<00:03:16.490> just<00:03:16.670> take<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.940> bag<00:03:17.120> fold<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> down

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
all joints that move independently I'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.110 
all joints that move independently I'll
show<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.610> what<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:31.940> mean<00:03:32.150> here<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.810> second<00:03:33.230> so

figure at all

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.550 
figure at all
it's<00:04:11.590> very<00:04:11.920> posable<00:04:12.220> very<00:04:12.970> posable<00:04:13.560> checked

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
it's very posable very posable checked

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.360 
it's very posable very posable checked
the<00:04:15.100> wrists<00:04:15.400> move<00:04:15.660> 360<00:04:16.660> movement<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.770> arms

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
the wrists move 360 movement in the arms

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.560 
the wrists move 360 movement in the arms
legs<00:04:19.300> knees<00:04:20.670> feet<00:04:21.750> head<00:04:22.750> can<00:04:23.020> swivel<00:04:23.290> sort<00:04:23.860> of

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
legs knees feet head can swivel sort of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.240 
legs knees feet head can swivel sort of
but<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.870> one<00:04:26.020> thing<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.290> really<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.920> there

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
but the one thing I really like is there

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.480 
but the one thing I really like is there
are<00:04:27.340> these<00:04:27.520> bull<00:04:27.820> joints<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.330> arms

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
are these bull joints on the arms

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.770 
are these bull joints on the arms
alternates<00:04:30.490> move<00:04:30.670> and<00:04:30.940> then<00:04:31.090> this<00:04:31.300> part<00:04:31.600> moves

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
alternates move and then this part moves

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.490 
alternates move and then this part moves
independently<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.360> really<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.290> that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
independently so I really like that that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.800 
independently so I really like that that
allows<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.460> lot<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.940> possibility<00:04:37.510> but<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
allows it a lot of possibility but the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.270 
allows it a lot of possibility but the
other<00:04:37.960> thing<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.290> absolutely<00:04:38.440> love<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
other thing I absolutely love is the
