00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.640 

I<00:00:01.290> want<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.979> select<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.490> entire<00:00:03.529> circle<00:00:04.529> so

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
I want to select the entire circle so

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.889 
I want to select the entire circle so
the<00:00:04.770> way<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:04.890> do<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.400> can<00:00:05.879> use<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
the way I do that is I can use the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.450 
the way I do that is I can use the
selection<00:00:07.170> tool<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.560> try<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> grab<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.309> whole

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
selection tool and try to grab the whole

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.390 
selection tool and try to grab the whole
thing<00:00:08.760> there's<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.570> way<00:00:09.780> with<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> timeline<00:00:11.160> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
thing there's a way with the timeline to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.310 
thing there's a way with the timeline to
select<00:00:11.639> everything<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.179> frame<00:00:12.450> by<00:00:12.929> clicking

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
select everything in a frame by clicking

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.880 
select everything in a frame by clicking
on<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.809> there's<00:00:15.809> also<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.170> ability<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
on it and there's also the ability to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.980 
on it and there's also the ability to
click<00:00:17.460> into<00:00:17.760> shapes<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.810> keep

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
click into shapes and as you keep

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
click into shapes and as you keep
clicking<00:00:19.500> sequentially<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> will<00:00:20.670> start

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
clicking sequentially it will start

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
clicking sequentially it will start
grabbing<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.689> more<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> shapes<00:00:22.380> as

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
grabbing more and more of the shapes as

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.099 
grabbing more and more of the shapes as
they<00:00:22.740> connect<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.060> case<00:00:24.300> one

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
they connect and so in this case one

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.450 
they connect and so in this case one
click<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> fill<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:25.980> click<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
click on the fill one click on the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.099 
click on the fill one click on the
stroke<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.150> one<00:00:27.390> click<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> stroke

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
stroke if I do one click on the stroke

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
stroke if I do one click on the stroke
and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.859> click<00:00:29.070> again<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.519> doesn't<00:00:29.670> go

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and then I click again it doesn't go

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.880 
and then I click again it doesn't go
anywhere<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.810> click<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> fill<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.439> click

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
anywhere one click on the fill and click

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.970 
anywhere one click on the fill and click
another<00:00:32.550> click<00:00:32.880> gives<00:00:33.090> me<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> stroke<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.980> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
another click gives me the stroke and I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.880 
another click gives me the stroke and I
had<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> whole<00:00:35.510> shape<00:00:36.510> select<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
had the whole shape select it and in the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
had the whole shape select it and in the
properties<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> change

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
properties for it I'm going to change

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.810 
properties for it I'm going to change
its<00:00:39.719> x<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.140> y<00:00:40.260> coordinates<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.370> into<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> x

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
its x and y coordinates so into the x

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.209 
its x and y coordinates so into the x
coordinate<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> 0<00:00:42.480> y<00:00:43.170> coordinate<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.680> 0<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
coordinate of 0 y coordinate is 0 and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
coordinate of 0 y coordinate is 0 and
that<00:00:44.879> puts<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> top<00:00:45.660> left<00:00:45.989> corner<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that puts it in the top left corner of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.770 
that puts it in the top left corner of
the<00:00:46.680> stage<00:00:46.980> which<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.370> top<00:00:47.730> left<00:00:47.969> corner<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> 0

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the stage which is top left corner to 0

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
the stage which is top left corner to 0
and<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> selection<00:00:50.730> tool<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and with the selection tool I'm going to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
and with the selection tool I'm going to
draw<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> rectangle<00:00:52.340> just<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> give<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> an

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
draw a rectangle just to give you an

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.930 
draw a rectangle just to give you an
idea<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> shape<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.910> how

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
idea of the shape and you can see how

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.810 
idea of the shape and you can see how
the<00:00:57.210> stroke<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.579> 12

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the stroke actually because it's 12

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
the stroke actually because it's 12
pixels<00:01:00.180> six<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> pixels<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pixels six of the pixels actually at the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
pixels six of the pixels actually at the
pinnacles<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> circle<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.690> off<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
pinnacles of the circle go out off the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
pinnacles of the circle go out off the
stage<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.309> they're<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> minus

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
stage so they're actually in the minus

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.160 
stage so they're actually in the minus
areas<00:01:06.979> minus<00:01:07.979> six<00:01:08.280> minus<00:01:08.520> six<00:01:08.990> even<00:01:09.990> though

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
areas minus six minus six even though

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.820 
areas minus six minus six even though
the<00:01:10.950> shape<00:01:11.189> itself<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.880> indicated<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.600> 0-0<00:01:12.930> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the shape itself is indicated at 0-0 so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
the shape itself is indicated at 0-0 so
the<00:01:13.950> stroke<00:01:14.220> has<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.610> particular<00:01:15.299> attribute

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the stroke has this particular attribute

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.880 
the stroke has this particular attribute
and<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.770> fact<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:19.200> terms<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> its

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
and the fact that it is in terms of its

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
and the fact that it is in terms of its
positioning<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.180> center<00:01:21.479> point<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
positioning it's the center point of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
positioning it's the center point of the
stroke<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.759> actually<00:01:23.759> positioned<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.450> if

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
stroke that's actually positioned or if

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
stroke that's actually positioned or if
I<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.840> dragged<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.380> stroke<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.580> might<00:01:26.790> think

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I just dragged a stroke you might think

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
I just dragged a stroke you might think
of<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> case<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.689> shape<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> actually

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
of in the case of a shape is actually

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
of in the case of a shape is actually
the<00:01:28.619> fill<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> giving<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.869> real

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the fill is giving me the real

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310 
the fill is giving me the real
coordinates<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.850> shape<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.229> won't

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
coordinates of the shape so this won't

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.069 
coordinates of the shape so this won't
be<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> problem<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.640> drawing

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
be a problem for you when you're drawing

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.480 
be a problem for you when you're drawing
visually<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> may<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
visually as we are but it may be a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
visually as we are but it may be a
problem<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> learn<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.540> programming

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
problem if you learn the programming

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.929 
problem if you learn the programming
language<00:01:40.400> ActionScript<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
language ActionScript and you have to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.330 
language ActionScript and you have to
position<00:01:42.210> things<00:01:42.540> you'd<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.810> careful<00:01:43.340> all

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
position things you'd be careful all

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
position things you'd be careful all
right<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.640> basically<00:01:44.909> our<00:01:45.720> first

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
right so that's basically our first

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
right so that's basically our first
circle<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> outline<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
circle which would be the outline of the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.200 
circle which would be the outline of the
face<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.979> clicked<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> documents<00:01:51.060> as

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
face so I clicked on the documents as

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
face so I clicked on the documents as
document<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.960> intentionally<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> click

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
document I intentionally going to click

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
document I intentionally going to click
on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> part<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> shape<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> says

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
on the part of the shape and it says

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.319 
on the part of the shape and it says
shape<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> had<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> careful<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
shape so I had to be careful here if I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.300 
shape so I had to be careful here if I
start<00:01:57.570> changing<00:01:58.049> properties<00:01:58.320> I'll<00:01:59.130> be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
start changing properties I'll be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.789 
start changing properties I'll be
changing<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.570> changed<00:02:04.110> it

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.930 

but<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.830> really<00:02:08.069> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> Oval<00:02:08.910> tool

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
but I really want to go to the Oval tool

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780 
but I really want to go to the Oval tool
and<00:02:09.630> now<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.440> properties<00:02:10.979> apply<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.490> Oval

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and now the properties apply to the Oval

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
and now the properties apply to the Oval
tool<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.270> won't<00:02:12.450> apply<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.350> I'll

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
tool and won't apply to this so I'll

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.520 
tool and won't apply to this so I'll
change<00:02:13.740> my<00:02:13.800> fill<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.520> read<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> see<00:02:16.140> my<00:02:16.290> shape

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
change my fill to read and see my shape

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.199 
change my fill to read and see my shape
is<00:02:16.680> protected<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.730> i'll<00:02:17.850> change<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
is protected and then i'll change the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.340 
is protected and then i'll change the
stroke<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.500> let's<00:02:19.860> say<00:02:20.040> four<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.350> then

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
stroke with to let's say four and then

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.800 
stroke with to let's say four and then
somewhere<00:02:22.770> where<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.790> might<00:02:23.970> put<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:24.330> eyeball

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
somewhere where you might put an eyeball

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.960 
somewhere where you might put an eyeball
i'll<00:02:25.230> use<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.950> shift<00:02:26.160> key<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.700> draw<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
i'll use the shift key and draw a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.220 
i'll use the shift key and draw a
perfect<00:02:27.209> circle<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> perfect<00:02:28.290> eyeball<00:02:30.230> grab

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
perfect circle do a perfect eyeball grab

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.110 
perfect circle do a perfect eyeball grab
selection<00:02:31.860> tool<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.430> let's<00:02:32.910> demonstrate

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
selection tool and let's demonstrate

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.150 
selection tool and let's demonstrate
again<00:02:33.750> moving<00:02:34.050> things<00:02:34.440> around<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.010> i'm<00:02:35.069> going

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
again moving things around so i'm going

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.280 
again moving things around so i'm going
to<00:02:35.250> move<00:02:35.459> select<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> entire<00:02:39.140> circled<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
to move select the entire circled the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
to move select the entire circled the
new<00:02:40.410> circle<00:02:40.769> they<00:02:40.860> drew<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.430> selection

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
new circle they drew and the selection

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.400 
new circle they drew and the selection
tool<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.360> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:42.690> too<00:02:42.810> helpful<00:02:43.110> because

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
tool is going to be too helpful because

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
tool is going to be too helpful because
it's<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:45.170> rectangle<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.890> i'm<00:02:47.850> going<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.180> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
it's a rectangle so i'm going to do is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.210 
it's a rectangle so i'm going to do is
click<00:02:48.540> again<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> fill<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.530> then<00:02:49.830> click<00:02:50.010> once

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
click again the fill and then click once

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.520 
click again the fill and then click once
more<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.730> get<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.090> stroke<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.230> drag<00:02:52.500> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
more to get the stroke and then drag it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.360 
more to get the stroke and then drag it
and<00:02:53.720> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.810> see<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.110> afterimage<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.800> kind

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and if you see the afterimage you kind

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.090 
and if you see the afterimage you kind
of<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.760> fill<00:02:57.060> where<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.799> if<00:02:58.950> i

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
of see the fill where it was and if i

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.300 
of see the fill where it was and if i
leave<00:02:59.549> drop<00:02:59.610> this<00:03:00.500> we<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> hole<00:03:01.920> where<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
leave drop this we have a hole where the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970 
leave drop this we have a hole where the
actual<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.060> phils<00:03:03.480> overlapped<00:03:04.230> now<00:03:04.739> where<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
actual to phils overlapped now where the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.289 
actual to phils overlapped now where the
two<00:03:05.130> strokes<00:03:05.489> overlapped<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.650> again

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
two strokes overlapped so do this again

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.170 
two strokes overlapped so do this again
just<00:03:09.299> move<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> stroke<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:13.019> there's<00:03:13.320> no

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
just move the stroke so there's no

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.490 
just move the stroke so there's no
changes<00:03:15.180> when<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:15.480> move<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.690> stroke<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.410> i

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
changes when we move the stroke but if i

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.880 
changes when we move the stroke but if i
move<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.860> fill<00:03:18.079> you<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.230> see<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.590> leaves<00:03:19.799> a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
move the fill you can see that leaves a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.979 
move the fill you can see that leaves a
hole<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.519> won't<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.910> again<00:03:21.150> until<00:03:21.959> i

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
hole now it won't do that again until i

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.599 
hole now it won't do that again until i
deselect<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.390> then<00:03:24.390> do<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.690> again<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.489> it's

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
deselect it and then do it again so it's

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.539 
deselect it and then do it again so it's
actually<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> technique<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.780> use<00:03:28.019> to

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
actually a technique that you can use to

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.789 
actually a technique that you can use to
draw<00:03:29.549> shapes<00:03:29.880> inside<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:31.079> shapes<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.500> create

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
draw shapes inside of shapes and create

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.470 
draw shapes inside of shapes and create
holes<00:03:32.040> in<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.790> depends<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.180> what<00:03:33.359> you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
holes in them it depends on what you're

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.550 
holes in them it depends on what you're
trying<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.780> accomplish<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.350> reshape

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
trying to accomplish or reshape

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.160 
trying to accomplish or reshape
something<00:03:35.340> by<00:03:35.519> taking<00:03:36.390> another<00:03:36.660> shape<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
something by taking another shape and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.660 
something by taking another shape and
putting<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.590> edges<00:03:38.040> all<00:03:38.250> drawing

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
putting it on the edges all drawing

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.470 
artist I know enough to get by fairly
well<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.190> skill<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.640> work<00:03:48.299> out<00:03:48.450> a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
well so it's a skill that you work out a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.789 
well so it's a skill that you work out a
hundred<00:03:48.750> percent<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.140> time<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.590> can

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
hundred percent of the time and you can

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.880 
hundred percent of the time and you can
find<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.340> all<00:03:50.459> vector<00:03:51.209> graphic<00:03:51.630> tools

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
find this in all vector graphic tools

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.470 
find this in all vector graphic tools
I'll<00:03:52.890> do<00:03:53.040> some<00:03:53.220> undos<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.030> mean<00:03:54.150> use<00:03:54.329> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
I'll do some undos here I mean use the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.789 
I'll do some undos here I mean use the
keyboard<00:03:54.900> shortcut<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.070> undo<00:03:56.880> my<00:03:57.030> way<00:03:57.209> back

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
keyboard shortcut and undo my way back

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.750 
keyboard shortcut and undo my way back
to<00:03:58.799> these<00:03:58.890> are<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> back<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.579> same

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
to these are in the back in the same

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.759 
to these are in the back in the same
place<00:04:00.739> if<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:01.890> want<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.100> copy<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:03.319> new<00:04:04.319> circle

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
place if I want to copy this new circle

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.890 
place if I want to copy this new circle
I'll<00:04:04.950> click<00:04:05.280> once<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.760> fill<00:04:05.970> once<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.420> once

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
I'll click once and a fill once on once

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.599 
I'll click once and a fill once on once
more<00:04:07.049> gets<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.560> stroke<00:04:07.829> I'll<00:04:08.100> use<00:04:08.640> copy<00:04:10.609> and

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
more gets the stroke I'll use copy and

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.080 
more gets the stroke I'll use copy and
then<00:04:11.880> i<00:04:12.000> will<00:04:12.120> use<00:04:12.299> paste

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.520 

and<00:04:15.209> again<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.169> won't<00:04:16.519> merge<00:04:18.049> when<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.139> do<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and again it won't merge when you do a

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.780 
and again it won't merge when you do a
paste<00:04:19.919> until<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:20.970> deselect<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:23.190> then<00:04:23.669> if

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
paste until you deselect it and then if

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.820 
paste until you deselect it and then if
you<00:04:23.910> try<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.389> move<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.780> again<00:04:24.900> you've<00:04:25.620> got<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
you try to move it again you've got a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.129 
you try to move it again you've got a
hole<00:04:28.010> alright<00:04:29.010> so<00:04:29.190> that's<00:04:29.280> basically<00:04:29.550> our

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
hole alright so that's basically our

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.390 
hole alright so that's basically our
eyeballs<00:04:31.580> we'll<00:04:32.580> talk<00:04:33.240> about<00:04:33.449> the<00:04:34.400> other

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
eyeballs we'll talk about the other

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.550 
eyeballs we'll talk about the other
tools<00:04:35.790> will<00:04:36.120> draw<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> mouth<00:04:36.600> in<00:04:36.960> another

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
tools will draw a mouth in another

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.980 
tools will draw a mouth in another
segment<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.400> basically<00:04:38.699> gives<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.960> idea

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
segment but basically gives you the idea

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.680 
segment but basically gives you the idea
of<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.500> shape<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.070> how<00:04:41.160> they<00:04:41.340> work<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.910> little

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
of a shape and how they work a little

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.300 
of a shape and how they work a little
bit<00:04:42.840> about<00:04:43.050> difference<00:04:43.680> between<00:04:43.919> a<00:04:43.949> stroke

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
bit about difference between a stroke

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.370 
bit about difference between a stroke
and<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.550> fill<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.150> just<00:04:45.630> get<00:04:45.810> you<00:04:45.930> started<00:04:46.229> on

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
and a fill and just get you started on

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.080 
and a fill and just get you started on
those<00:04:46.500> concepts<00:04:47.100> because<00:04:47.400> that's<00:04:47.580> all<00:04:47.760> vector

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
those concepts because that's all vector

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.960 
those concepts because that's all vector
graphics<00:04:48.570> are<00:04:48.750> our<00:04:49.250> shapes<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.610> are

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
graphics are our shapes that are

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.629 
graphics are our shapes that are
combined<00:04:51.540> together<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.740> made<00:04:52.950> up<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.280> strokes

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
combined together and made up of strokes

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.110 
combined together and made up of strokes
and<00:04:53.910> fills<00:04:54.530> using<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.620> different<00:04:55.979> tools<00:04:56.250> and

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and fills using a different tools and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.580 
and fills using a different tools and
you<00:04:57.540> create<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> things<00:04:58.139> that<00:04:58.290> you<00:04:58.410> need

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
you create the things that you need

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
you create the things that you need
whether<00:04:58.889> it's<00:04:59.010> cartooning<00:04:59.729> or<00:04:59.940> its<00:05:00.240> user

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
whether it's cartooning or its user

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.680 
whether it's cartooning or its user
interface<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:02.150> panels<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.330> things<00:05:03.510> like

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
interface and panels and things like
