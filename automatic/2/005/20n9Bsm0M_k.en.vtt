eggplant<00:00:52.730> puree<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.989> first<00:00:54.229> step<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
eggplant puree the first step is to

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.410 
eggplant puree the first step is to
rinse<00:00:54.949> your<00:00:55.159> eggplants<00:00:55.819> make<00:00:55.999> sure<00:00:56.210> they're

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
rinse your eggplants make sure they're

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.200 
rinse your eggplants make sure they're
ripe<00:00:56.780> they<00:00:57.440> are<00:00:57.499> shiny<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.489> we<00:00:58.699> are<00:00:58.819> going<00:00:58.999> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
ripe they are shiny so we are going to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:11.560 
ripe they are shiny so we are going to
start<00:00:59.449> by<00:00:59.600> cutting<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.019> tip<00:01:09.310> with<00:01:10.310> air<00:01:10.579> so<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
start by cutting the tip with air so the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:21.490 
start by cutting the tip with air so the
fastest<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:13.490> can<00:01:13.670> cook<00:01:13.939> it<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.390> better<00:01:20.500> I'm

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
fastest you can cook it the better I'm

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.639 
fastest you can cook it the better I'm
trying<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.860> take<00:01:21.979> out<00:01:23.200> most<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.649> seats

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
trying to take out most of the seats

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
will be going to be multiple packets of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:42.399 
will be going to be multiple packets of
seeds<00:01:40.329> that's<00:01:41.329> interesting<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:42.020> thought<00:01:42.200> that

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
seeds that's interesting I thought that

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.959 
seeds that's interesting I thought that
the<00:01:42.530> seeds<00:01:42.770> were<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> middle<00:01:43.520> most<00:01:43.789> of

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
the seeds were in the middle most of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.120 
the seeds were in the middle most of
them<00:01:44.119> but<00:01:44.359> really<00:01:44.750> there's<00:01:45.679> like<00:01:45.740> little

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
them but really there's like little

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.940 
them but really there's like little
pockets<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.640> seeds<00:01:46.909> close<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.659> skin<00:01:47.990> here

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950
