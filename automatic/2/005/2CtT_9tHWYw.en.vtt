00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that on the website itself another nice

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
that on the website itself another nice
thing<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.859> app<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.340> challenge<00:01:00.030> me<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
thing about this app is challenge me you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.849 
thing about this app is challenge me you
can<00:01:00.660> actually<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:01.320> at<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.590> current

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
can actually look at your current

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
can actually look at your current
records<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> challenge<00:01:03.180> yourself

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
records and you can challenge yourself

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
records and you can challenge yourself
to<00:01:03.840> break<00:01:04.110> those<00:01:04.320> records<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.920> kind<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to break those records so it kind of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.000 
to break those records so it kind of
keeps<00:01:05.400> things<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.880> interesting

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
keeps things a little interesting

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.530 
keeps things a little interesting
another<00:01:08.010> important<00:01:08.549> feature<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
another important feature is the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
another important feature is the
calibration<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
calibration let's say you know the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.520 
calibration let's say you know the
you're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> park<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.409> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you're going out in the park and you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.810 
you're going out in the park and you're
gonna<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.830> four<00:01:14.040> laps<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
gonna do four laps and you know that's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.210 
gonna do four laps and you know that's
gonna<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> mile<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.049> obviously

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
gonna be a mile you can obviously

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.830 
gonna be a mile you can obviously
calibrate<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> system<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> GPS<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.689> be

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
calibrate the system or the GPS to be

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
calibrate the system or the GPS to be
able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> mile

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
able to know that that was a mile

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
able to know that that was a mile
because<00:01:21.000> sometimes<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> system<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
because sometimes the system can be a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.730 
because sometimes the system can be a
little<00:01:22.470> off<00:01:22.710> by<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> few<00:01:23.549> points<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.689> mile<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little off by a few points of a mile so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.410 
little off by a few points of a mile so
that's<00:01:26.040> something<00:01:26.340> important<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.210> note

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that's something important to note

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.929 
that's something important to note
another<00:01:28.110> great<00:01:28.439> thing<00:01:28.680> about<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
another great thing about this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
another great thing about this
application<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.990> documents<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.979> map

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
application is that it documents the map

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.760 
application is that it documents the map
as<00:01:32.460> well<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.030> pace<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:34.320> fast<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
as well as your pace and how fast you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
as well as your pace and how fast you
were<00:01:34.890> running<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.640> literally<00:01:36.090> see

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
were running and you can literally see

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
were running and you can literally see
where<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.350> were<00:01:37.470> having<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> hardest<00:01:38.189> times

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
where you were having the hardest times

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
where you were having the hardest times
as<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> guys<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> red<00:01:39.540> zones<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:40.229> my

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
