00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.530
 and to teach how to get 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:16.090
 basically the pieces of 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.970
 the cars hidden in each of the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.510
 the sections of the cross wall for 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.290
 start is basically super simple no 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.720
 I'm going to say one by one because they study 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.880
 torton but I'll tell you a trick 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.900
 always to find them the trick 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.900
 simple x 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 have the antennas located 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 it's as easy as for example being here 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.250
 marks us as an antenna does 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.570
 offering continue to appear in one in 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 this area 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.480
 that means that around here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.329
 there is a 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.640
 a dozen and how we locate it two 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 for example in the hundreds is very 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.140
 random because he could be here 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 i 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.930
 travel fast if you do not have the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.300
 site visited yes no 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 maybe I have taught him a very easy trick 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.500
 to get to the destination quickly then 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.370
 now I hope to do the whole first if 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.080
 I have to get them to plant how 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.910
 locate the team match very 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 easy 660 hospitals and below the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.020
 right too 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.130
 grievance and the six fund above the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.579
 ends 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.579
 there it is 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 but 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.840
 it is well seen 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010
 with the command 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.829
 the end of red to yellow 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.930
 and when I was, you find as if 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 were to synchronize the mind of the 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.210
 person the people with the see you found and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.120
 then mark what I feel 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.600
 activities that are around here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.020
 monuments and then vice up to the 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.020
 filters 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.190
 tena 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.800
 the monuments and the cars 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.960
 then here it is easy to know is to the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.430
 next you set now it comes out as 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.430
 if it were antenna but in it 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 to see to teach how quickly the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.120
 that I have these two to complete 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.640
 the D 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.630
 people 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.880
 we have here this 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.790
 so nothing quickie 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.920
 we approach normally in cars 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.360
 already in the hundreds of random and in the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 cars is no longer so random 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.439
 normally but you're right in the middle 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.439
 if you are at all with the macba 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 watch this 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.300
 once 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.500
 At the end of the waypoint, mark it 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.500
 just above the car 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.500
 is with that 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.440
 you can embitter the constancy in the car 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.910
 to fix waypoint you can not 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.910
 match that hand 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.530
 fix where route 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.530
 when the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.370
 It was the trick to get there 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.000
 Well then, days ago and why I have 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.280
 seen until today is the state 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.250
 this same 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.760
 so straight here more like a story 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.780
 Social 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.780
 travel fast 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.330
 and load 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.970
 also discovering and radio 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:35.009
 and that's how you get on the meters quickly 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.009
 advantage of the fastest disadvantage 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.780
 because the ways 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:46.790
 if you are not going to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.630
 fast and slow down the road put 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.920
 to find activities 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.920
 and you will find 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:57.010
 to get there 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.920
 and ended with the consequent 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.930
 benefits with his death once 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.100
 we found the new car what there is 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.100
 what to do is explain 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.100
 national 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.340
 the earth is life 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.340
 here we have 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.050
 and I have all the snows coming out 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:06:03.180
 let's go back to the base and then let's go 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:06:03.180
 for all 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.999
 different 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.999
 in all the different 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:17.139
 states seems a way in the team 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:21.689
 there is and confronts and the d 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.689
 on the off-road street 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.550
 then you have events 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.380
 if not, 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.090
 and so far this example in the cryo 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.180
 I hope you liked it serves as 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.699
 help if you want me to specify more 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.900
 on how to get what to smoke like 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:51.320
 when I get the others the others 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.150
 States do not put some comments for 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:58.060
 do any other query that 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.060
 have the goal of solving 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.670
 see you in the next video 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.970
 all right
