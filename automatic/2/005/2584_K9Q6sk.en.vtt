00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
painting class so I have more time to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
painting class so I have more time to
work<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.890> oil<00:01:44.130> paintings<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.600> I'm<00:01:45.720> at

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
work on oil paintings up because I'm at

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.080 
work on oil paintings up because I'm at
17<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> half<00:01:46.740> unit<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> only<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
17 and a half unit so you can only have

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.539 
17 and a half unit so you can only have
18<00:01:48.600> units<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> think

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
18 units so I think

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.130 
18 units so I think
even<00:01:52.210> though<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.329> would<00:01:52.450> probably<00:01:52.780> be<00:01:52.990> really

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
even though it would probably be really

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.630 
even though it would probably be really
fun<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.840> take<00:01:55.869> ballroom<00:01:56.320> dancing<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:59.640> can't
