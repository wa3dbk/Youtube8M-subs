 of a few hours they approach talcahuano 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.750
 we have returned to the turtle I think what 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 more important because after much 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.239
 now rebuilt time rejuvenated 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.940
 beautiful welcomes the cultores of the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.789
 cuecas choras so that makes a 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.500
 most relevant point of what is nowadays 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.509
 is showing here he tortured him good 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.630
 if it's true we're already in the room 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.880
 championship day an exhausting day 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.990
 but with much satisfaction couples 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.300
 the truth has delivered everything in the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.679
 party have delivered all their talent that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.390
 today we are seeing the final night like this 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.380
 very happy as a team so 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.190
 We have achieved 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.800
 get to the different regions look there 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 some great couples 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.450
 there are other good there I can not tell you 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.649
 which is a good level because there are 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.050
 some that lack some things that 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.039
 maybe it has lost what is the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.080
 cueca itself because it is taken thinking that 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.300
 because it's brave or because I now have 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.270
 to dance as you like as you want 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.300
 but the putting in has its square is 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.920
 the cueca our national dance fits 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.750
 highlight that the main theme of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.950
 this dance is the description of events and 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.500
 typical scenarios of the city is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.869
 port this style was born in the middle of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.489
 20th century on the web in santillana and between 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.679
 its main managers is

 eduardo parra national singer-songwriter native 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 of chillán it is necessary to remember that the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.200
 championship was developed for four 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.239
 days in different locations of the channel 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.220
 conception with the aim of enhancing 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.270
 the communes in their cultural edges and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 artistic 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.530
 Tubes and contraception were 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.330
 chosen places to present this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.990
 variant of the traditional cueca that 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.080
 delighted the attendees 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.500
 we have lived it super well until a little 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.470
 intense a bit of nervousness but what 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.330
 to take a place higher than the one

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.950

 cliché and that a good experience of 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.090
 true yes a good experience I think that 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.520

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.650
