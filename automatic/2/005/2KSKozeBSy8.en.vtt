 three kilometers 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.350
 he learned about this bitumen 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.770
 no panic to which houseboat 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.490
 the western festival the day before 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.800
 its clientele is international 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.420
 and it's been ten years since lurking photographers exploited the vein 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.840
 the mythical climb 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.120
 all amateurs 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.520
 anonymous as paolo from italy for cci 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.860
 on the theater of his idol 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 but easier to take place 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 the other of pantani that in to match the performances 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.500
 the link with the public highway 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.570
 Furthermore 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.710
 it's important for you to decide any time 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.500
 wind up doing it 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.630

 21 turns 15 km of racing in the blazing sun and yet 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.880
 they are more of a 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.670
 hiller every day 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.120
 we can challenge ourselves 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.350
 some landed on the ground others more cushy 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 the league of champions who are you going to try to do m 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.769
 the mecca of cycling one way 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.049

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:22.519
 year 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 he tackles his last corner for injury 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.139
 segura 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.379
 for the global one year ago before 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
 the same 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.169
 age 57 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.219

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.949
 santander is obviously not running after the exploits 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.059

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.519
 they are extraterrestrial 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.519
