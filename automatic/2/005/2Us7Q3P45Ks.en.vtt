00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 good 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.599
 how about friends of autocosmos.com my 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.279
 name is hector mayor and how can 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.650
 have realized today I'm disguised 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.460
 we are driving this motorcycle 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.860
 we have here the name is the yamaha xt 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.530
 1200 super ténéré better known as 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.870
 super ténéré and good is the top of the range 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.550
 of the dual-purpose motorcycles of the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.500
 Mark how well your name says it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.110
 motor is 1200 cubic centimeters 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.059
 as you already know Yamaha does not express any 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.979
 number of power or torque 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.050
 but well we estimate that this engine should 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.909
 walk more or less between the 120 horses 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.189
 130 and good 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.589
 I send all this power through the 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.839
 transmission that is a 6 speed 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.930
 and the rear tire sends it through a 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.170
 cardan we can say that this is like 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.530
 directly the competition of the abm w 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.619
 r 1200 gs that good in this year is 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.750
 premiering engine and good for 2014 that 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.640
 is the model that we are testing the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.490
 yamaha super ténéré also had a 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.759
 update even if it's really very 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.009
 little bit was more in the engine and good 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.450
 in the gimbal inside the equipment that 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.050
 we find in this one yamaha 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.330
 in 2014 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.000
 we have here the management modes that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.130
 We can choose between two sports and others 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.920
 touring in the touring let's say the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.050
 accelerator is much more retarded is not 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.030
 so aggressive that in fact good of all 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.010
 forms is quite sensitive but good 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.470
 in sport mode it is much more 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.560
 sensitive and good also feels the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.530
 much more nervous motorbike 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.690
 we found the travel computer that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.000
 we can modify through the controls 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.210
 we have here and we also have a 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.370
 menu to control all these options 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.710
 move the traction control to remove 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.630
 the bs and so on we all manage from 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.450
 the handlebar the fuel tank is 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.400
 quite large is 23 liters so 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.960
 it's a pretty heavy bike in all 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.410
 senses has a large motor has a 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.780
 big and good tank all this does 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.300
 that reaches up to 260 kilos so 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.120
 If it is an important price but with 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.930
 1,200 cubic centimeters has for that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
 and for much more 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.830
 it's a pretty practical bike that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 can use in city 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.420
 obviously under the precautions that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.280
 you need to take 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.090
 but on the highway is where it really 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.160
 enjoy where also 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.160
 we can make a much longer trip 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.260
 is very comfortable in the position is quite 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.660
 erect has for a protection against 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.150
 the air and good has all these 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.540
 capabilities also for outside of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.390
 path that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.579
 good all dual-purpose motorcycle should 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.609
 to have so good that this bike has 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.849
 also a great ability to go in 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.739
 highway like to be on a road 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.890
 of dirt road handling the super 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.900
 ténéré of 2014 the time that is quite 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.670
 comfortable is not very smooth clutch 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.879
 it requires a lot of force to drive 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.260
 the changes come pretty easy to 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.850
 high changes can be made 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.740
 without clutch up 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.700
 the accelerator as we said is a 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.129
 takes little sensitive but good 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.470
 about 5 or 10 minutes to get used to and 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.150
 you're already on the other side good with 1,200 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.700
 cubic centimeters the time you can 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.440
 reach speeds of more than 200 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.420
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.060
 let's start it has six speeds like that 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.739
 that you can keep pushing and good we 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.230
 like this duality that it has is 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.780
 practice for the city is also 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.430
 practice for road and travel and good 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.470
 for those who like the out of the way 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.630
 you also have these capabilities despite 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.560
 that is not as sophisticated as the bm 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.599
 w 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.660
 in which they have many things 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.630
 electronic the yamaha meets quite 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.000
 well with the basics we like it to be a 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.569
 little bit more archaic we can regulate the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.160
 rear shock preload if 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.989
 we go alone or we come with a 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.640
 companion and we can also regulate it 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.260
 according to our tastes and our 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.880
 finally we hope you have 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.329
 enjoyed this test drive 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.000
 the yamaha xt 1200 super ténéré better 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.020
 known as super ténéré 1200 and good 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.020
 see you in the next
