all<00:00:00.359> right<00:00:00.480> these<00:00:00.690> are<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.930> instructions<00:00:01.469> on

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
all right these are the instructions on

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.800 
all right these are the instructions on
how<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.829> make<00:00:02.100> your<00:00:02.700> neo<00:00:02.939> cube<00:00:03.270> into<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.629> shape

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
how to make your neo cube into the shape

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.420 
how to make your neo cube into the shape
of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.080> cube<00:00:04.319> start<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:04.920> your<00:00:05.069> default

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
of the cube start with your default

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.059 
of the cube start with your default
shape<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.940> plump<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.810> just<00:00:07.410> kind<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.620> break<00:00:07.859> off

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
shape a plump and just kind of break off

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.190 
shape a plump and just kind of break off
a<00:00:08.099> piece<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.730> start<00:00:09.389> pulling<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.900> with<00:00:10.050> your

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a piece and start pulling it with your

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.730 
a piece and start pulling it with your
right<00:00:10.380> hand<00:00:10.650> into<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.730> line<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.590> your

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
right hand into a line and with your

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980 
right hand into a line and with your
left<00:00:13.830> hand<00:00:14.099> I'll<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:15.210> kind<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> rotate<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
left hand I'll just kind of rotate the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.250 
left hand I'll just kind of rotate the
clump<00:00:16.199> around<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.690> it<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.750> kind<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> makes

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
clump around and it just kind of makes

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:31.440 
clump around and it just kind of makes
it<00:00:19.410> easier

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.510 

so<00:00:32.450> eventually<00:00:32.750> you'll<00:00:33.380> have<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:33.739> thing<00:00:34.040> all

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
so eventually you'll have this thing all

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.380 
so eventually you'll have this thing all
drawn<00:00:35.059> out<00:00:35.090> into<00:00:36.050> one<00:00:36.590> long<00:00:36.829> line<00:00:37.210> and<00:00:38.210> when

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
drawn out into one long line and when

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.360 
drawn out into one long line and when
you<00:00:38.480> do<00:00:38.750> you're<00:00:39.739> going<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:39.920> want<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.190> make<00:00:40.340> it

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
you do you're going to want to make it

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.810 
you do you're going to want to make it
into<00:00:40.699> a<00:00:40.730> loop<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.040> way<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.220> make<00:00:43.460> it<00:00:43.579> into

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
into a loop and the way to make it into

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.270 
into a loop and the way to make it into
a<00:00:43.850> loop<00:00:44.059> is<00:00:44.239> real<00:00:44.480> real<00:00:44.690> easy<00:00:44.720> all<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.890> do<00:00:46.070> is

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
a loop is real real easy all you do is

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.079 
a loop is real real easy all you do is
take<00:00:46.520> your<00:00:47.510> one<00:00:47.750> loose<00:00:47.960> end<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:49.879> bring

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
take your one loose end and you bring

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.910 
take your one loose end and you bring
over<00:00:50.300> your<00:00:50.720> other<00:00:51.140> loose<00:00:51.410> end<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:54.470> just<00:00:54.500> touch

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
over your other loose end you just touch

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.500 
over your other loose end you just touch
them<00:00:55.100> together<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.670> now<00:00:55.879> you've<00:00:56.030> got<00:00:56.180> a<00:00:56.239> loop

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
them together and now you've got a loop

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.450 
them together and now you've got a loop
so<00:00:57.199> then<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.379> want<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.559> fold<00:00:57.769> down<00:00:58.040> your<00:00:58.070> loop

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
so then you want to fold down your loop

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.009 
so then you want to fold down your loop
just<00:00:59.329> like<00:00:59.449> this<00:01:00.370> all<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.670> way<00:01:01.790> down<00:01:02.030> so

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
just like this all the way down so

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.469 
just like this all the way down so
you've<00:01:03.140> got<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:03.559> parallel<00:01:04.100> lines<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:05.420> you

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
you've got two parallel lines then you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.640 
you've got two parallel lines then you
want<00:01:05.659> to<00:01:05.720> take<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.020> two<00:01:06.200> ends<00:01:06.409> of<00:01:06.590> your

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
want to take the two ends of your

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.590 
want to take the two ends of your
parallel<00:01:07.070> lines<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.729> touch<00:01:08.240> them<00:01:08.479> together

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
parallel lines and touch them together

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.260 
parallel lines and touch them together
like<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.400> have<00:01:10.520> four<00:01:10.760> parallel

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
like this so that you have four parallel

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.230 
like this so that you have four parallel
lines<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:12.560> want<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.890> want<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.400> undo<00:01:14.000> this

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
lines and you want to want to undo this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.320 
lines and you want to want to undo this
edge<00:01:14.479> just<00:01:15.290> like<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:18.159> okay<00:01:19.159> now<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:20.210> have

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
edge just like that okay now you have

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.630 
edge just like that okay now you have
four<00:01:20.540> parallel<00:01:20.900> lines<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.619> want<00:01:21.799> six<00:01:22.159> so

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
four parallel lines but you want six so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.030 
four parallel lines but you want six so
what<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.909> want<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.150> do<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.570> estimate<00:01:24.170> about<00:01:25.009> a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
what you want to do is estimate about a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.170 
what you want to do is estimate about a
third<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.580> way<00:01:25.700> down<00:01:27.610> bring<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.640> over<00:01:29.030> just

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
third of the way down bring it over just

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.719 
third of the way down bring it over just
like<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.659> it's<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.619> little<00:01:30.890> too<00:01:31.070> much<00:01:31.310> so

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
like that it's just a little too much so

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.359 
like that it's just a little too much so
we'll<00:01:31.939> take<00:01:32.090> one<00:01:32.150> line<00:01:32.570> left<00:01:32.890> there<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.040> go

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
we'll take one line left there we go

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.450 
we'll take one line left there we go
you<00:01:35.150> take<00:01:35.439> two<00:01:36.439> off<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.920> side<00:01:39.369> pull<00:01:40.369> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
you take two off of this side pull it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.880 
you take two off of this side pull it
down<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:40.670> like<00:01:40.969> that<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:41.600> now<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:42.289> have<00:01:42.560> six

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
down just like that and now you have six

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.370 
down just like that and now you have six
parallel<00:01:43.249> lines<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.630> cube<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:44.960> six<00:01:45.200> by

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
parallel lines and the cube is six by

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.609 
parallel lines and the cube is six by
six<00:01:45.679> by<00:01:45.890> six<00:01:46.219> so<00:01:46.429> we'll<00:01:46.549> count<00:01:46.700> over<00:01:47.090> by<00:01:47.240> six

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
six by six so we'll count over by six

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.700 
six by six so we'll count over by six
fold<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.770> down<00:01:48.920> back<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.399> its<00:01:49.579> own<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.710> then

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
fold it down back on its own and then

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.270 
fold it down back on its own and then
the<00:01:51.859> other<00:01:52.009> way<00:01:52.249> and<00:01:53.439> just<00:01:54.439> alternating<00:01:54.950> back

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
the other way and just alternating back

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.959 
the other way and just alternating back
and<00:01:55.310> forth<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:57.520> there<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.609> have<00:01:58.670> it

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
and forth and there you have it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.779 
and forth and there you have it
they<00:01:59.509> use<00:01:59.689> your<00:01:59.899> cube<00:02:00.139> good<00:02:00.770> job<00:02:01.039> I'm<00:02:01.310> proud<00:02:01.549> of

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
they use your cube good job I'm proud of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.999 
they use your cube good job I'm proud of
you
