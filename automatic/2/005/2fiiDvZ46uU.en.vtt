00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.499
 Today we also want to talk about how we have been the brake 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.939
 It is the first time ever - you want to drive yourself 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.339
 or 15 of the brake affect the daily traffic 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.669
 therefore a small check 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 this would require more vehicles to be used unchanged 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.350
 and there we have two brakes that we can control all my own 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.650
 footbrake 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.970
 and then the handbrake 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 We want to control them step by step 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.640
 First of all, we want to dedicate our footbrake 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.290
 The foot brake or service brake also called the best too 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.860
 control the solution should have hidden first had the handbrake 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.850
 need to start the engine continue to use a braking force of the support principle 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 Dancing is important 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.720
 if no gear is engaged, let Gangloff release the clutch 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 they brake as hard as we can now 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.230
 note we can not step up to the floor panel that is important now 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.300
 that has some resistance in the field somewhere 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.040
 by coupling offenders 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.550
 how the world really continues 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.250
 as it has to brake 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.250
 The whole thing was supposed to be about that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 one third 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.649
 On the contrary, I should not let my brakes lie 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.909
 that is a feeling that I build with this resistance 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.050
 brake 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.229
 next 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.780
 but not tasks 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.899
 Driving short guy 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.920
 control my band Sweet 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.410
 I'll catch up for a moment 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.720
 my conclusion price 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
 This is a first short check of the ready 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.120
 Next we want to control the adjustable 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640
 We were two controls for the very first 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.770
 pretty disturbed brake and at the latest on the third rest 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:10.649
 Deadlines are bought 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.730
 like the hard worker to pull we will be the resistance 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.599
 in vain puts the transfer on the brake 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.129
 there is slowed down 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.640
 if that made it a bit tighter that really the disturbing 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.719
 feast 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 let's just try and get rid of any resistance from the officials 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 the city council again the engines 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.289
 the first gear 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.509
 Worms in the explanation 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.139
 we were probably not happy here 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.389
 he can not necessarily because 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.809
 my brakes help 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:47.709
 now you have everything important to the brake Bochum and students of course 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.930
 If he demands are the whole world in the elevator of course, too 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.839
 on the 8th 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.489
 Can you also contact us directly? I will
