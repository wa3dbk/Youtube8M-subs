00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.399
 in this hotel and if in law how to record a dvd 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.310
 to be displayed on most devices 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.680
 we will not use the nero he lived 4 he is a program that he can find 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.550
 Your mother at the movies. 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.569
 Only him 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.279
 or if you want you can download it through an application suite 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.980
 What is a suite? 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 it's from applications to one announces a set of multiple programs 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.980
 among them you will find the nero lived 4 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.050
 both meet at number 7 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 number eight and if you want you can download the nera 8 cross 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.659
 this mega makes dot net 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.059
 of the negative point round and pontonet 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.440
 good today after the neuroscientist side of the computer and from there we will start the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.720
 program 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.920
 initiated 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 all these programs win the prize 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.970
 7 is what I can or computer 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.200
 as I said 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 we chose the nero vision option 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.930
 in this initial screen of nero lived 4 we choose the option to create dvd if 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.789
 Do you have an English program, and you understand a lot of English? 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:07.939
 you can year 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.070
 observe the icons and the order of them for example was the first option 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 here probably the mec and dvd is already registered but the icon will be similar 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469
 Good, let's hack dvd. 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.700
 video dvd 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.650
 there you can observe 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 other than nero 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.220
 explains that in this region kia 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.890
 What is it for? 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.330
 so if you watch the program all seasons 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.410
 there will be no problems 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.900
 the still leading tucano and video dvd 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.030
 can not complain later 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.860
 good what are we going to do without being intimidated now add the files 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.840
 you can the saunas 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.240
 video files 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.790
 from digital camera 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850
 the movie you downloaded 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 and it supports multiple formats 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 good here to add video files 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.440
 very important you know where you are stored your files will be 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.050
 of video 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.059
 this video 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:12.589
 for example that I have a film grant that I have sauber on computer the 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:13.579
 south groups 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.170
 the regional is not 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.119
 I'm doing no illegal activity 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:20.879
 the ani here has a bearing 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.129
 since they say 'I'm a fan of the birth of the first child 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 there I would record a dvd with these images 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.269
 on here 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.079
 added 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.339
 an archive with iraq 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.619
 Let's add file 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.619
 one can not for example why so many selections 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:43.239
 eight clips 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.359
 same thing click 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.640
 again triggered going video 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.579
 you look for the place where 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.449
 he is 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.449
 in the case of the top gun workspace networks 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.689
 I chose 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.779
 select 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.859
 I'm ready soon 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.859
 three movie clips do not say so 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.379
 now up to continual 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.150
 process 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.239
 click next 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.389
 the diveo message 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.409
 which type would download various menus 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.309
 generally 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.179
 they will close 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.559
 ready that page that along 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.439
 is the starting part of your dvd 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.359
 no you are not fully edited for example you can click here or in May 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.009
 say 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.989
 put the moment 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.940
 What you want, we're going here. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.839
 much more says 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.839
 to put birth 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.649
 the course can book 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.599
 For example, birth 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.049
 everything that is typed 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.750
 are for example going to have a wedding 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.059
 can put some background image 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:03.769
 related 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.219
 to finish 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.010
 are several options you can 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.409
 to explore in the future 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.869
 in our case let's move forward 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.299
 close 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.639
 mother is that the menu options you can download more or less 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.669
 from Internet 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.159
 the ana at first has regions plus three of them 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.650
 standard and the less 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.099
 we can not fear them here 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.479
 should have created the case has none 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.479
 let's create 3d process images and how it works 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.509
 for the time being it's going to be additional three more of two clicks I've done more 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.249
 television - that they have actions 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.499
 be understanding 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:46.629
 advance 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.479
 she 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.340
 in texts then 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.930
 bush - finished 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 I want 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.749
 already in advance 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.939
 because it is creating the transcode menus of the flu inmates and all this 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.879
 process takes now only rely on the computer two three hours 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.379
 creating a DVD in this way 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.430
 it is time consuming 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.069
 I'm a businessman 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.250
 a personal thing must also observe 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.499
 it's space 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:39.179
 the bird that has a good space to record a dvd because it should only 4 days you go 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:43.209
 have to have a lot more so that for him I could work 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.340
 how much more 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.860
 effects to the anamara menus you create 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.600
 it is unacceptable that the living book will be delayed 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:02.520
 on here 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.520
 process will slow down 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.560
 is an important tip while you are doing this process here dwarf 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.289
 I do not use the computer for anything else on the under ground. Do not do anything else because 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.050
 otherwise this may cause some 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.610
 problem at the time of going and produced the dvd I called suddenly how it is done 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.539
 It's good to avoid this so you just leave your computer to 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.689
 off screen wide 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 leaves 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.029
 to appeal to what he is doing the process and he will open the lid 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:42.289
 will open the dvd drive if yes i'll insert a virgin dvd 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.289
 I will wait for the recording it will already be automatically 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.889
 and recording is ready 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.659
 it was this people thanks 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.039
 and anything you can post 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.469
 your doubts 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:56.589
 9th portal of the mega does little this year were 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.209
 that's it, that's ok
