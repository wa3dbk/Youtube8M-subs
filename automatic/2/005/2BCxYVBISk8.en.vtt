00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
flowers that we use to create the shape

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
flowers that we use to create the shape
of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> arrangement<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
of the arrangement so we're going to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
of the arrangement so we're going to
start<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:55.100> we're<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
start with them we're just going to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.139 
start with them we're just going to
place<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.120> three<00:00:58.460> into<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> arrangement

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
place two or three into the arrangement

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.740 
place two or three into the arrangement
again<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.280> less<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
again I think that less is more that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
again I think that less is more that
means<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> few<00:01:05.220> flowers<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
means that just a few flowers is all you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.109 
means that just a few flowers is all you
need<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> want

need to make just the look you want

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.789 
need to make just the look you want
again<00:01:09.119> keep<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> mind<00:01:09.869> where<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.680> the

again keep in mind where you want the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
again keep in mind where you want the
arrangement<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:11.820> finished
