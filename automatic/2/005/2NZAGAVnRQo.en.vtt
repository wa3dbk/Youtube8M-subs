touched one of those so I'll try to get
that<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.640> no<00:01:38.759> one<00:01:38.790> takes<00:01:39.030> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that out of there so no one takes that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.460 
that out of there so no one takes that
home<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.659> we'll<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.350> there

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
home so we'll get that one out of there

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.630 
home so we'll get that one out of there
and<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.860> too<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.159> were<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.340> both<00:01:41.490> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stuffed Oreos like we talked about

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.940 
stuffed Oreos like we talked about
something<00:01:46.020> let's<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.740> figure<00:01:46.860> out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
something let's see if we can figure out

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.649 
something let's see if we can figure out
all<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.460> crazy<00:01:47.670> designs<00:01:48.060> they<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.450> here

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
all the crazy designs they got here

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.219 
all the crazy designs they got here
first<00:01:48.890> off<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.130> 39<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.000> never<00:01:51.720> did<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> never<00:01:52.049> did

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
first off a 39 I never did I never did

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.539 
first off a 39 I never did I never did
this<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> Halloween<00:01:52.979> Oreos<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> felt

this one with the Halloween Oreos I felt

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.039 
this one with the Halloween Oreos I felt
bad<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.000> after<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> fact<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.659> 39

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
bad about it after the fact so I got 39

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.889 
bad about it after the fact so I got 39
as<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.130> car<00:01:56.790> they're<00:01:57.659> getting

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
as one we got a car they're getting

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.310 
as one we got a car they're getting
clever<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:59.509> what<00:02:00.509> designs<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:01.049> putting<00:02:01.259> on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
clever with what designs are putting on

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130 
clever with what designs are putting on
these<00:02:01.380> Oreos<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> 14<00:02:03.540> alright<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
these Oreos and now I got a 14 alright I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
these Oreos and now I got a 14 alright I
think<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.579> might<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.820> been<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> bit

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.069 

here<00:02:58.909> we've<00:02:59.209> talked<00:02:59.390> about<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.569> before

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
here we've talked about this before

the designs we all know that a normal
Oriole<00:03:03.829> looks<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.849> it's

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
Oriole looks like this right and it's

got the raised ridges it's got this it's
got<00:03:07.129> little<00:03:07.250> designs<00:03:07.579> here<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.659> when<00:03:08.750> you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
got little designs here but when you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.869 
got little designs here but when you
take<00:03:08.989> an<00:03:09.110> Oreo<00:03:09.290> then<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.829> start<00:03:10.430> taking<00:03:10.760> out

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
take an Oreo then and start taking out

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.149 
take an Oreo then and start taking out
massive<00:03:11.360> chunks<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:12.230> where<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> designs<00:03:12.890> are

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
massive chunks of where the designs are

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.710 
massive chunks of where the designs are

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
where the three-dimensional shape should

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.610 
where the three-dimensional shape should
be<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:16.099> think<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:16.730> throws<00:03:17.000> off<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.620> wafer

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
be I do think it throws off the wafer
