00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Come with a smile
and don't rock the boat.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.560
That's the message to those
attending the primary schools'

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.440
kapa haka nationals,
Te Mana Kuratahi,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.040
in Tauranga over the next few days.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.400
Oriini-Tipene Leach
is amongst the action.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.760
Plenty of spare seats left,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.440
making it more comfortable
for those who showed up

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.760
at day one of the competition.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.240
Door sales weren't a problem

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.920
for those who'd forgotten
to buy online,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.320
but getting around the small
stuff proved a challenge for some.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.640
We're trying to put these things on.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.160
So we don't get kicked out.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.560
Yes, if it swells up
it'd make things worse!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.320
And as many a hakanut would know,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.040
you can't get in while
a group's on stage.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.200
Don't shoot the messenger.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.840
I'm one of them.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.360
That's all I have to say.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.920
I feel sorry for the ones
who are locked out.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.520
But for most,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.240
it's about supporting whanau.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.000
Taranaki are here to support

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.640
this event and our kids.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.960
And a chance for those
who don't stand

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.120
until tomorrow or Thursday

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.520
to check out the competition.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920
We've come to support
the haka groups

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080
so that we're laid-back

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.400
towards them.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.200
In time we will get to Te Matatini

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.280
like our elders and our parents.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.400
After today's 13 performances

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.320
there's stiff competition ahead
of the remaining teams

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.240
yet to take the stage.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480
But one thing's for sure,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.760
there won't be a shortage
of kapa haka exponents

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.240
for years to come.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.040
Oriini Tipene-Leach, Te Karere.
