00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.330
 good guys I hope you are and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.500
 welcome to a new video in the video 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.969
 today we are going to see the function 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.030
 2 for axis 2 as you will all know in the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.100
 axis 2 with double touch unlocks vale 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.100
 that when you touch touch forgiveness it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.590
 block through these let's say not home 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.270
 two days ago it was updated and in that 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.110
 update that I current and that 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.330
 basically manually opened a new 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.830
 exception in the lock screen and you 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.110
 We give blocking type and equipment 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.000
 appears not with kobe as you are seeing 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.860
 Many of you already know what this is for 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 people who do not know if I explain it 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.180
 not right now 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.150
 is a new security method that has 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.340
 fed then the people of lg the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.900
 true in this method 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.670
 I particularly love it and I hope 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.530
 look for it during the rest you have 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.450
 looking for the one that chooses two since it is a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.500
 very safe method of security and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.770
 same time that is quite 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.110
 entertaining to look for it 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.060
 OK 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.030
 this is we can do a combination of 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.200
 up to 80 different ones with which in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.110
 total do 80 and 82 thousand 532 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.780
 possible different combinations of the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.150
 which other one we are going to do one of those 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.950
 82 thousand 500 and peak combinations in this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 case then we do this we can 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 make very long combinations and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 structures of 8 once we have had 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.100
 visibility in case we forget him 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.710
 the not with cover and now just for 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.179
 that works we block it normally and 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.670
 as you see double tap function and 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.079
 does not receive that signal now for 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.130
 unlock it we would have to see in or 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.130
 I know what we have done 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.280
 but it has not worked 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.560
 it works almost always is 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.630
 solve is that you have any 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.560
 part of the screen in cluj 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 thank you, little ones 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.689
 if it works quite well is a method 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.040
 that I really recommend that you use 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.150
 You can also do it with the screen 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.380
 the azero block something like this 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.179
 at the same time you could change what 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.179
 external with ccoo from here 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.720
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.490

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.310
