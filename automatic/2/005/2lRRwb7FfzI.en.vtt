00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 I decided to talk because I'll show you 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250
 this group here he no I did not see box 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 It's a joke, but he thinks it's not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.050
 same as the normal iphone 5 is a product 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 new but it comes packaged different 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 domains and that within a glance at 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.579
 see how it comes and if they are 5 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.989
 spare beauty make the clothes 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:05.070
 wet so it's still packed right 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:06.810
 to cut the chiller we open a lot 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.689
 easy to see what comes the invoice is a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.430
 invoice for product replacement 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.619
 apple sent do not come back here that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:23.400
 I have approached and we will see what he has 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:25.830
 here comes a box closed 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 I do not know that this is just giving a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.540
 look let's do it fiscal comes a note 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.439
 Look what's in here after all 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
 inside that I'm starting to know 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.890
 it's not every day that we can 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:56.189
 Reveal Apple 's Spare Products is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:57.860

 Let's see here, here, let me get this 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:10.140
 here on the side by the catimba here of the time 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.600
 Thank you for choosing an apple. 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.450
 It does not even bother you that you changed your 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.739
 product here this iphone has warranty 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.440
 90 days 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.440
 He is not a year old, sorry? 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 but when you open here then you say that it is 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.450
 imported by the right time and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.670
 let's cut it here it comes a fee is well 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.370
 cheap cache very compact by the way 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.209
 It should be just an iphone from within. 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.209
 I believe 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:51.269

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.590
