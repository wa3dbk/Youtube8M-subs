here<00:00:10.850> we<00:00:11.000> are<00:00:11.090> running<00:00:11.270> out<00:00:11.510> of<00:00:11.540> yarn<00:00:11.959> and<00:00:14.350> I'm

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
here we are running out of yarn and I'm

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.859 
here we are running out of yarn and I'm
making<00:00:15.590> an<00:00:15.830> educated<00:00:16.219> guess<00:00:16.520> that<00:00:16.580> if<00:00:17.330> I<00:00:17.510> start

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
making an educated guess that if I start

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.960 
making an educated guess that if I start
making<00:00:18.020> my<00:00:18.230> ribbing<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:19.190> will<00:00:19.490> get<00:00:19.670> about

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
making my ribbing now I will get about

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.450 
making my ribbing now I will get about
an<00:00:20.179> inch<00:00:20.420> of<00:00:20.660> ribbing<00:00:21.170> out<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.070> last<00:00:22.250> bit

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
an inch of ribbing out of the last bit

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.089 
an inch of ribbing out of the last bit
of<00:00:22.490> yarn<00:00:23.470> so<00:00:24.470> I<00:00:24.500> start<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.449> knit<00:00:26.449> purl<00:00:26.750> knit

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
of yarn so I start the knit purl knit

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:38.770 
of yarn so I start the knit purl knit
purl<00:00:28.099> ribbing<00:00:31.150> purl<00:00:32.150> knit<00:00:34.570> purl<00:00:36.130> and<00:00:37.130> knit<00:00:37.780> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
purl ribbing purl knit purl and knit and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.930 
purl ribbing purl knit purl and knit and
continue<00:00:39.290> like<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:39.500> until<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.280> have<00:00:40.490> about<00:00:40.880> a

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
continue like that until we have about a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.160 
continue like that until we have about a
good<00:00:41.360> inch<00:00:41.600> at<00:00:42.500> least<00:00:42.740> of<00:00:43.040> ripping<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.240> you

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
good inch at least of ripping if you

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.780 
good inch at least of ripping if you
wanted<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.590> start<00:00:45.800> early<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.430> had<00:00:46.610> more

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
wanted to start early and you had more

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.730 
wanted to start early and you had more
yarn<00:00:47.150> and<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:47.480> wanted<00:00:47.810> to<00:00:47.870> do<00:00:47.990> a<00:00:48.020> whole<00:00:48.290> leg<00:00:48.590> of

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
yarn and you wanted to do a whole leg of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.420 
yarn and you wanted to do a whole leg of
ripping<00:00:49.330> that's<00:00:50.330> also<00:00:50.720> possible<00:00:51.310> but<00:00:52.310> these

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
ripping that's also possible but these

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.660 
ripping that's also possible but these
are<00:00:52.640> going<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.820> be<00:00:52.910> slightly<00:00:53.380> short<00:00:54.380> socks<00:00:57.670> so

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
are going to be slightly short socks so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.840 
are going to be slightly short socks so
to<00:00:59.480> finish<00:00:59.630> off<00:00:59.960> I<00:01:00.290> do<00:01:00.410> knit<00:01:00.980> purl<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.140> then<00:01:03.140> I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
to finish off I do knit purl and then I

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.130 
to finish off I do knit purl and then I
knit<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.059> two<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.390> them<00:01:05.630> together<00:01:06.259> I<00:01:08.140> find

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
knit the two of them together I find

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.380 
knit the two of them together I find
that<00:01:09.200> this<00:01:09.320> gives<00:01:09.560> quite<00:01:10.040> elastic<00:01:10.430> maybe

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that this gives quite elastic maybe

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.620 
that this gives quite elastic maybe
sometimes<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.870> little<00:01:11.990> bit<00:01:12.110> too<00:01:12.290> elastic

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
sometimes a little bit too elastic

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.060 
sometimes a little bit too elastic
finishing<00:01:14.630> but<00:01:15.020> I'd<00:01:15.410> rather<00:01:15.620> have<00:01:15.830> on<00:01:15.950> the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
finishing but I'd rather have on the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.060 
finishing but I'd rather have on the
elastic<00:01:16.490> finishing<00:01:16.880> around<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.770> foot

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
elastic finishing around the the foot

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.370 
elastic finishing around the the foot
and<00:01:19.400> then<00:01:19.760> one<00:01:19.970> that's<00:01:20.210> tight<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.870> get<00:01:20.990> over

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and then one that's tight to get over

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.980 
and then one that's tight to get over
the<00:01:21.500> your<00:01:21.980> foot<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:24.560> for<00:01:25.010> every<00:01:25.250> new<00:01:25.990> stitch

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the your foot so for every new stitch

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.560 
the your foot so for every new stitch
that<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:27.290> knit<00:01:27.409> i<00:01:28.000> knit<00:01:29.000> them<00:01:29.120> together<00:01:29.270> with

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
that I knit i knit them together with

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.250 
that I knit i knit them together with
the<00:01:29.690> previous<00:01:30.110> one<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.860> knit<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:31.310> knit<00:01:32.260> it

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
the previous one so I knit one knit it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:43.590 
the previous one so I knit one knit it
together<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.770> purl<00:01:37.040> one<00:01:37.340> knit<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:41.030> together

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.930 

as<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.870> see<00:01:45.050> it's<00:01:45.170> finishing<00:01:45.680> off<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
as you can see it's finishing off to the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.789 
as you can see it's finishing off to the
right

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799
