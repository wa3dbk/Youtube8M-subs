the<00:00:40.410> game<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.239> was<00:00:42.239> proud<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> fact<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> we

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the game I was proud of the fact that we

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
the game I was proud of the fact that we
were<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.530> position<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.110> very

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
were in position to do that and very

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
were in position to do that and very
frustrated<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.129> did<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
frustrated that we did not do that I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.279 
frustrated that we did not do that I
think<00:00:49.879> our<00:00:50.879> players<00:00:51.210> showed<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> lot<00:00:52.260> of

take<00:05:35.860> anybody<00:05:36.190> out<00:05:36.250> after<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.610> me<00:05:36.850> two<00:05:37.000> hours

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
take anybody out after that me two hours

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.950 
take anybody out after that me two hours
I<00:05:38.140> don't<00:05:38.380> understand<00:05:39.450> how<00:05:40.450> he<00:05:40.510> said<00:05:40.780> there's

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
I don't understand how he said there's

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.360 
I don't understand how he said there's
twelve<00:05:41.170> gods<00:05:41.350> us<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.680> what<00:05:41.830> we<00:05:41.980> played<00:05:42.280> with

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
twelve gods us of what we played with

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.590

what<00:05:57.220> we<00:05:57.310> thought<00:05:57.490> no<00:05:57.850> we<00:05:58.300> understand<00:05:58.690> it's

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
what we thought no we understand it's

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.350 
what we thought no we understand it's
not<00:05:58.840> perfect<00:05:59.350> us<00:05:59.620> so<00:05:59.740> few<00:06:00.520> throws<00:06:00.850> here<00:06:01.120> there

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
not perfect us so few throws here there

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.390 
not perfect us so few throws here there
but<00:06:01.540> you<00:06:01.690> saw<00:06:01.900> some<00:06:02.170> good<00:06:02.380> runs<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:03.040> know<00:06:03.160> end

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
but you saw some good runs you know end

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.730 
but you saw some good runs you know end
up<00:06:03.669> with<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.300> dimension<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.930> does<00:06:05.110> add<00:06:05.380> some

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
up with that dimension it does add some

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.159 
up with that dimension it does add some
things<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.250> that<00:06:07.180> was<00:06:07.390> good<00:06:07.600> to<00:06:07.720> see<00:06:07.930> now<00:06:08.110> you

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
things and that was good to see now you

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.900 
things and that was good to see now you
start<00:06:08.530> putting<00:06:08.710> some<00:06:08.890> real<00:06:09.130> stress<00:06:09.520> on<00:06:09.850> a

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
start putting some real stress on a

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.350 
start putting some real stress on a
defense<00:06:10.419> when<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:10.960> can<00:06:11.169> do<00:06:11.860> our<00:06:12.360> normal

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
defense when you can do our normal

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
tempo and and with the way we try to

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.280 
tempo and and with the way we try to
stretch<00:06:17.980> the<00:06:18.160> field<00:06:18.690> with<00:06:19.690> our<00:06:19.840> passing<00:06:20.260> game

way that embraced that challenge of

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.030 
way that embraced that challenge of
preparing<00:07:08.490> and<00:07:08.669> play<00:07:09.090> if<00:07:09.990> we<00:07:10.380> do<00:07:10.560> that<00:07:10.770> to<00:07:10.950> the
