00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now what I'm going to show you is a zone

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.660 
now what I'm going to show you is a zone
more<00:00:03.500> there's<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.589> jeans<00:00:04.830> issuers<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:05.549> if

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
more there's a jeans issuers and so if

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.820 
more there's a jeans issuers and so if
you're<00:00:05.819> eating<00:00:06.000> mostly<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.629> live<00:00:06.839> foods<00:00:07.200> it's

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you're eating mostly the live foods it's

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.070 
you're eating mostly the live foods it's
still<00:00:08.099> raw<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.370> terms<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.000> we're<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.929> use

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
still raw in terms of we're going to use

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.620 
still raw in terms of we're going to use
cashews<00:00:10.650> instead<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.160> soybeans<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:11.940> cashews

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
cashews instead of soybeans but cashews

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.919 
cashews instead of soybeans but cashews
are<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.110> slightly<00:00:13.500> better<00:00:13.860> than<00:00:14.160> eating<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
are just slightly better than eating the

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.359 
are just slightly better than eating the
soybeans<00:00:15.929> because<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.590> know<00:00:17.100> grow

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
soybeans because they know grow

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.340 
soybeans because they know grow
naturally<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.150> processing<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.900> crossing

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
naturally the processing is crossing

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
naturally the processing is crossing
them<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> shell<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:21.570> know

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
them out of the shell but you know

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
them out of the shell but you know
you're<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> consume<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.039> you're<00:00:23.160> in

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you're going to consume it if you're in

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
you're going to consume it if you're in
your<00:00:23.760> office<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.810> many<00:00:25.109> people<00:00:25.230> might

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
your office because many people might

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
your office because many people might
have<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:26.039> soy<00:00:26.279> allergies<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.380> don't<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
have like soy allergies or don't want to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
have like soy allergies or don't want to
consume<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.130> soy<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.609> different<00:00:29.880> reasons<00:00:30.269> so

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
consume the soy for different reasons so

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.139 
consume the soy for different reasons so
will<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.949> option<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.489> doing<00:00:32.700> using

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
will we have the option of doing using

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
will we have the option of doing using
the<00:00:33.239> cashew<00:00:33.950> cashew<00:00:34.950> cheese<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.489> made<00:00:35.730> it's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the cashew cashew cheese is made it's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.080 
the cashew cashew cheese is made it's
very<00:00:36.270> similar<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.520> soy<00:00:38.520> cheese<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.000> we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
very similar to the soy cheese that we

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.580 
very similar to the soy cheese that we
just<00:00:39.300> saw<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> do

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just saw but what we're going to do

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.170 
just saw but what we're going to do
instead<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.920> oil<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.520> instead<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
instead of using the oil and instead of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.209 
instead of using the oil and instead of
using<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.539> swing<00:00:45.960> note<00:00:46.230> we're<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> use

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
using the swing note we're going to use

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
using the swing note we're going to use
the<00:00:47.340> cashews<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.710> these

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the cashews and what we do with these

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
the cashews and what we do with these
caches<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.430> soak<00:00:50.700> them<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.000> about<00:00:51.390> eight

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
caches we soak them for about eight

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.279 
caches we soak them for about eight
hours<00:00:51.949> that<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> helps<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.730> eliminate<00:00:54.480> what's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
hours that it helps to eliminate what's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
hours that it helps to eliminate what's
called<00:00:55.559> enzyme<00:00:56.100> inhibitors<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.379> enzyme

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
called enzyme inhibitors in enzyme

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.150 
called enzyme inhibitors in enzyme
inhibitors<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.750> acids<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.050> prevent<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
inhibitors are acids that prevent the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
inhibitors are acids that prevent the
foods<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.760> being<00:01:03.000> digestible<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> human

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
foods from being digestible in the human

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.060 
foods from being digestible in the human
body<00:01:05.090> this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> why<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.979> like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
body this is why you would so think like

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.090 
body this is why you would so think like
seeds<00:01:08.610> nuts<00:01:09.380> different<00:01:10.380> grains<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.640> saw

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
seeds nuts different grains and we saw

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.920 
seeds nuts different grains and we saw
for<00:01:12.340> a<00:01:12.369> certain<00:01:12.850> amount<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.210> time<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.720> have

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
for a certain amount of time that I have

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.350 
for a certain amount of time that I have
charts<00:01:14.290> available<00:01:14.439> in<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.130> book<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:16.119> would

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
charts available in the book you would

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.560 
charts available in the book you would
have<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:18.040> removes<00:01:18.400> these<00:01:18.610> enzyme<00:01:19.060> inhibitors

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
have it removes these enzyme inhibitors

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.390 
have it removes these enzyme inhibitors
and<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.930> allows<00:01:20.200> for<00:01:20.229> example<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.009> seeds<00:01:21.280> to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
and it allows for example the seeds to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.730 
and it allows for example the seeds to
sprout<00:01:21.640> if<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.150> want<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.420> sprout<00:01:22.659> receipt<00:01:23.110> you

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
sprout if you want to sprout receipt you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.830 
sprout if you want to sprout receipt you
soak<00:01:24.009> them<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.490> get<00:01:24.640> rid<00:01:24.850> of<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.060> inhibitors

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
soak them to get rid of the inhibitors

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.109 
soak them to get rid of the inhibitors
and<00:01:26.080> then<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.799> can<00:01:26.979> just<00:01:27.220> rinse<00:01:27.790> them

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
and then you can just rinse them

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.090 
and then you can just rinse them
periodically<00:01:28.540> over<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.560> course<00:01:29.799> of<00:01:29.920> some

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
periodically over the course of some

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.010 
periodically over the course of some
days<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.549> help<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:30.940> little<00:01:31.390> sprouts<00:01:31.720> will

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
days and help and little sprouts will

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.950 
days and help and little sprouts will
grow<00:01:32.229> on<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.340> cashews<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.390> helps<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.780> make

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
grow on the cashews that helps to make

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.840 
grow on the cashews that helps to make
them<00:01:35.140> more<00:01:35.170> digestible<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.640> soaked

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
them more digestible if you soaked

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.499 
them more digestible if you soaked
almonds<00:01:37.509> or<00:01:38.229> walnuts<00:01:39.100> or<00:01:39.310> different<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:40.390> know

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
almonds or walnuts or different you know

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.870 
almonds or walnuts or different you know
that<00:01:40.780> different<00:01:41.289> seeds<00:01:41.590> different<00:01:42.460> crane

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
that different seeds different crane

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.320 
that different seeds different crane
it'll<00:01:43.810> helps<00:01:44.049> remove<00:01:44.319> that<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:45.030> these<00:01:46.030> caches

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
it'll helps remove that so these caches

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.090 
it'll helps remove that so these caches
again<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:47.080> 48<00:01:47.319> hours<00:01:47.770> we're<00:01:47.920> going<00:01:48.009> to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
again it is so 48 hours we're going to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.830 
again it is so 48 hours we're going to
put<00:01:48.220> them<00:01:48.429> in<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.690> processor<00:01:50.970> okay<00:01:51.970> now<00:01:52.690> what

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
put them in the processor okay now what

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.080 
put them in the processor okay now what
we're<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.140> add<00:01:53.319> also<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:54.100> can<00:01:54.250> get<00:01:54.970> some

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
we're going to add also you can get some

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.649 
we're going to add also you can get some
water<00:01:56.159> i'm<00:01:57.159> going<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.399> add<00:01:57.550> water<00:01:58.000> instead<00:01:58.600> of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
water i'm going to add water instead of
