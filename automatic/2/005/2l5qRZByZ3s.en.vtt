00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 split 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.370
 what can be said about killzone 3 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.860
 hey i'm lying like that 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.470
 Fine unlike metallophone r-studio 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.560
 gorilla listens to his fans does that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.020
 for which they are paid the plot 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.690
 alone in any part of the series is much 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.700
 worse than multiplayer this time it's not 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.460
 very important because the creators of the game 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.720
 decided a lot better in the company itself and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.810
 they did it 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610
 the plot is just gorgeous this time its 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.180
 filing can with the last 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.250
 parts of call of duty 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.979
 however, do not go deep plot 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.520
 it's like a swamp you start about the plot and 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.440
 tighten to the neck 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.970
 everyone knows about the two sides of the same coin 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.010
 so in this game smoked created 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 great company but over 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.770
 multiplayer decided to relax a little 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.410
 no of course he stayed in the best 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.320
 part of this series but damn where big 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.480
 the number of cards I honestly played about 3 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.650
 hours multiplayer and managed to walk along 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.630
 All cards are 20 well, probably from 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.750
 innovations perhaps worth noting 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.450
 new melee techniques they became 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.780
 very cruel at the same time very 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 the stylish arsenal has been improved 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.360
 and expanded is now much easier to identify 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 for yourself a favorite in firepower under 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.890
 particular deadly heavy weapons us 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.019
 gave a separate slot that is practically 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.310
 any machine gun or rocket launcher can 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.280
 put in your pocket 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.160
 well now let's talk about the voice acting 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.800
 and the music will start with a good course 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.019
 music is incomparable this time composers 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.820
 tried on alloys begins main 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.530
 themes in the menu and ending with the final 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.030
 captions 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.549
 sound effects are still on very 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.280
 high level everything sounds realistic and 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.200
 truly complete the picture is conducive and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.630
 hollywood voice characters 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.630
 well and at last left the most spectacular 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.530
 no matter what the quality of the picture 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.510
 has grown compared to the sequel is not well 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.580
 Understandably that managed achieve this 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.400
 by splitting the level into small 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.590
 zones but still it's a grafon as well 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 amazes from special effects and drawing 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.599
 most of the objects but in the end 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.989
 very realistic but at the same time 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.400
 fantastic light 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.190
 Well, on this all I think it's time 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.930
 round out and so is my score on the game in 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.390
 8 points out of 10 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.190
 I believe that those people in whom there is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.100
 ps3 they don't play this game 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.739
