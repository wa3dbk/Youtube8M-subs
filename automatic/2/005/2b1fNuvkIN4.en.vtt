00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
 Hi. How are you? 

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
 I'm Dr. SanagustÃ­n 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.399
 and in this video I'm going to talk about poliglobulia or polycythemia. 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:06.249
 So, what is a polyglobulia? 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.711
 Strictly speaking it is an erythrocytosis, it is an increase of red blood cells 

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.719
 circulating 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.010
 and the specific data would be an increase in 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.960
 erythrocyte globular mass. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 Usually like this more difficult to calculate 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.390
 what we do is to be guided by the hematocrit. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.140
 It is considered that there may be a polyglobulia 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.689
 when the hematocrit is greater than 55% in men 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.810
 and greater than 50% in women. 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.080
 We can suspect it also if the hemoglobin 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.010
 it is greater 18 gr / dL in males 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 and greater than 16 gr / dL in women. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.850
 We have to be careful because it can be a relative or 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.400
 a pseudopolythemia 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.020
 or a pseudopoliglobulia 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.440
 or a relative polyglobulia 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 secondary to decreased plasma volume 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.390
 which may be for different reasons. 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.800
 Then, the physiopathological mechanisms, 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.080
 that is, the pathophysiology of polyglobulia 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.439
 which? We have two fundamental mechanisms. 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.600
 One is for the increased secretion of erythropoietin 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.700
 and the other by a monoclonal proliferation of the stem cell. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.310
 The first case the most frequent cause is usually an increase of erythropoietin 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.909
 secondary to hypoxia in the tissues. 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.729
 Normally it will be due to a chronic hypoxemic hypoxia 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.460
 , that is to say, by a problem normally of respiratory type that makes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.999
 that the oxygen in blood, the saturation of oxygen, is diminished. 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:38.140
 Normally below 92%, we can measure them with a pulse oximeter, 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:47.229
 and this will be what stimulates the HIF1 factor at the level of the renal tubular cells 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.920
 that will stimulate the increase in production of erythropoietin that will act at 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 of bone marrow and there will be an increase 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.509
 of the erythropoietic series. 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.350
 This hypoxia may be due in some cases to a hemoglobinopathy in which there 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.539
 a greater affinity for oxygen and a practical level because what is produced is 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.340
 a lower arrival to the tissues and a hypoxia. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.670
 And then another cause of increased secretion 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.940
 of eritrotopoietin would be the autonomous production 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.840
 secondary to some type of liver, kidney tumor, 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 cerebral... 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.831
 Regarding the monoclonal proliferation of the 

00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:26.220
 stem cell ... this would be the Policitemia Vera 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 that apart from the increase of the red series, that is, 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.390
 of red blood cells, there may be 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.360
 an increase in leukocytes and platelets, although the most frequent initial symptom 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 It is usually the increase of red blood cells. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.970
 In this case, this increase in erythrocytes will act at the renal level producing a 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.120
 inhibition of erythropoietin production, EPO. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.420
 In this case, the level of erythropoietin in blood 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.340
 it is a data that helps the differential diagnosis. 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.890
 As for the causes of polyglobulia, can be deduced from the mechanisms 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.700
 physiopathological that we have commented. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.110
 First of all, we have the secondary polyglobulia, which can be secondary 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.510
 to hypoxia, as for example in COPD 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.880
 in sleep apnea or a poliglobulia secondary to smoking that in this case 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.560
 rather than hypoxia, it would be due to carboxyhemoglobinemia. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.330
 These would be the most usual, but after 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.890
 we have autonomous secondary polyglobulia, which would be produced by 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.330
 an increase in EPO due to kidney problems, neoplasms. 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.400
 Then we have the primary polycythemia, which would be polycythemia vera. 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.680
 There is an increase in all the hematopoietic series, 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.290
 that is, they also increase white blood cells and platelets, but what is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.760
 more characteristic is polyglobulia, 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.860
 that is, the increase of the red series 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.070
 which is usually what happens 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.070
 first. 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.280
 And we must also take into account what we mentioned at the beginning of the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.330
 relative poliglobulias or pseudopolicitemias 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.960
 that are produced by a decrease in plasma volume. 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.100
 That is, the erythrocyte globular mass is 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.920
 normal, but by decreasing the plasma volume 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.710
 It seems that there is a polyglobulia, but it is not real. 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.950
 This can be caused by an excess of treatment with diuretics, 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.120
 by dehydration secondary to diarrhea, vomiting, in large burns 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.680
 and other circumstances. 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.299
 Regarding clinical manifestations, it is 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.439
 It may be asymptomatic 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.000
 and that it's a laboratory finding, but other 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.590
 Sometimes it may present due symptoms 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.740
 to blood hyperviscosity. 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.550
 Symptoms that can be found in the anamnesis can be headache, 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.860
 feeling dizzy, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, insomnia 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.699
 and nonspecific symptoms of this type. 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.080
 In the physical examination we can find erythrosis, that is, reddish skin color 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 and mucous membranes 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.640
 and an effect that can occur due to the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.789
 blood hyperviscosity is to leave 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.669
 slowing circulation and this implies 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.550
 a hypoxia and an increased risk of thrombosis. 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.770
 There will be more specific symptoms according to the underlying pathologies. 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.819
 If it is a secondary polyglobulia, then we can find respiratory problems, 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.479
 nightly snoring according to COPD or sleep apnea. 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.949
 We can find, for example, that polycythemia sometimes starts with a 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.770
 aquagenic pruritus, that is, when in contact with water 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.259
 that I already explained in another video and 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.550
 bleeding problems may appear 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.729
 or also what I have mentioned before, arterial and venous thromboses. 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.009
 You can also find some abdominal mass if there is some type of tumor 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.599
 that may have produced an increase in erythropoietin in case of 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.580
 neoplasms, hepatic, renal or 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.410
 You can often find a splenomegaly in the Policitemia Vera. 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.749
 The personal and family background will guide us in one way or another. 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.319
 The laboratory data are also important: the blood count, the saturation 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.319
 of oxygen 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.759
 and then you can ask for additional tests such as ultrasound, tomography, resonance 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.229
 according to what is considered appropriate. 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.819
 Sometimes the quantification of the erythrocyte mass may be necessary 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.969
 if the saturation is normal and there are no causes of 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:02.969
 poliglobulia, 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.189
 and this they would have to do in hematology. 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.779
 And also erythropoietin could you ... could you 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.340
 determine to make the differential diagnosis 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.150
 between primary polycythemia and secondary polyglobulia. 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
 In primary poliglobulia, in polycythemia vera, 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.229
 erythropoietin is decreased 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.529
 instead, in the others it is increased as 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.930
 we have already commented on the pathophysiology of polyglobulia. 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.930
 A problem that can also occur due to the increase in blood viscosity 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.199
 and that resistance to blood flow is that there 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.289
 a hypervolemia due to the increase of erythrocytes 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.199
 and this can lead to heart failure. 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.370
 As for the treatment, I will not go into much depth, but as is logical, according to the causes 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.229
 If it is a secondary polyglobulia, it will be necessary 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.740
 study the causes that have caused the polyglobulia and treat this. 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.499
 In the case of polycythemia vera, it will be necessary to 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.900
 a hematological treatment by 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.819
 the corresponding specialists. 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.610
 And that's it. If you liked it, remember to subscribe, give "like", share

 Thank you.
