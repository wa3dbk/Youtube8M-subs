00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.060 
and that are going to last a long time
that's<00:01:47.729> why<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> cost<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:49.070> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that's why it cost so much the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's why it cost so much the
difference<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.180> shears<00:01:51.899> themselves<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
difference in the shears themselves is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.780 
difference in the shears themselves is
just<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> quality<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> metal<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.520> twenty

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
just the quality of the metal the twenty

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
just the quality of the metal the twenty
thirty<00:01:56.969> dollar<00:01:57.210> ones<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.869> ten<00:01:58.170> stainless

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
thirty dollar ones are for ten stainless

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.060 
thirty dollar ones are for ten stainless
steel<00:01:58.890> the<00:02:00.079> ones<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> cost<00:02:01.530> between<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
steel the ones that cost between a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.350 
steel the ones that cost between a
hundred<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> two<00:02:02.610> hundred<00:02:02.640> dollars<00:02:03.090> those<00:02:03.210> are

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
hundred to two hundred dollars those are

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990

440<00:02:04.170> stainless<00:02:04.229> steel<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.670> difference

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
440 stainless steel and the difference

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.499 
440 stainless steel and the difference
is<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> percentage<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.640> metals<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.910> the
