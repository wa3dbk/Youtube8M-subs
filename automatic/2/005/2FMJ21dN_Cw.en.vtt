00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.740
 on the ground 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.250
 but 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 Sim big hello my name is Julia 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.710
 thanks for stopping by the rivers on the canal 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 I want to make this video 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.590
 unusual manicure will be used for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.770
 him I'm such a decor is a flag with them 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.350
 met everyone recently and decided 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 choose this red here if you 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 interested in the question where I ordered this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.000
 flag then all the links I leave under 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.430
 video who are interested go take a look 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 chose it on the site naomi on this site 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.739
 represented a lot of different 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.750
 products for manicure and by the way from the flag 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.299
 was presented in various colors 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.700
 I want to say a few words what about 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.790
 himself this flop represents him yet 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.820
 called velvet powder it consists of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.110
 crushed such small Prussian 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 micro particles 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.939
 when you put it on the nail or 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 just if you touch the jars tom 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.210
 really resembles such a very gentle 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.619
 to the touch 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.509
 powder when working with him need to be very 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.149
 careful because these little ones 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.240
 the pieces just fly in all 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.310
 side I inadvertently blew in the direction where 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.249
 this flag lay and of course he 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.469
 scattered me around the table and covered 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.909
 completely all the items that are there 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.880
 were so be careful 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.679
 even if this required manicure nail 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 I chose such a father I 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.929
 but in principle, you can take any important 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.509
 so that it matches the color of the flock 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.460
 I also need tweezers using 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.399
 him i will recruit this vlog and 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.189
 distribute on the nails by the way its also 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.460
 can be spread out with a fan brush 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.130
 already as you like me the same way 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.260
 such a brush is useful if you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.930
 It is interesting to see how I do a manicure 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.480
 syllable om then stay on my channel 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.690
 further and watch this video to everyone 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.640
 pleasant viewing 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.770
 so I retreat about such here 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.310
 the amount of flock so far this will be 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.830
 enough now to cover 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 nail 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.680
 Loco to get pretty such 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.680
 dense layer 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.930
 and do not immediately expect the varnish to freeze 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:03:04.260
 We start to put a flag I take such here 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:06.299
 big pieces and sprinkle a nail now 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.209
 flat piece of tweezers i'm a little 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:18.629
 I press it all down you flock well 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:25.950
 stuck to the lacquer now take the brush start 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:29.389
 gently remove the excess it can also 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.389
 drink a little left right 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.050
 and I'm still fixing the flock 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:49.060
 finger all the same we do 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.690
 and with the following nails a layer of varnish is still 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:04:02.770
 I repeat it should be very much 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:05.400
 dense and immediately begin to sprinkle 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.400
 flag 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.960
 like this 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.850
 now we tamp it down with a brush 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.430
 but do it very carefully so as not to 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.450
 greased syava slag now let 's do it 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.450
 next marigold 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.770
 sprinkle with onion 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.960
 a little wait literally seconds maybe 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.160
 20 and begin to clean full brush if 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.480
 you're too early to start picking one 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.480
 can remain bald spots 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.240
 every time before applying varnish on 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:46.120
 new nail I clean it of it 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.120
 flock so that benefits do not get villi 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.620
 I want to show you what happened in 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.110
 the result is such a beauty nails 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.580
 very pleasant to the touch soft 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.460
 velvety to harden the varnish with 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.580
 flock must wait literally 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:30.480
 20 minutes can be a little more and 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.610
 then you can even wash your hands with everything 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.100

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.040
