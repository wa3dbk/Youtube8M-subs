00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
your heel side edge you can definitely

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.330 
your heel side edge you can definitely
do<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
do that

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
do that
there's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.789> tool<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.270> forward<00:00:57.600> lean

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
there's a tool that's forward lean

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.619 
there's a tool that's forward lean
adjustment<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.070> high<00:00:59.219> back<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.640> well<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
adjustment on the high back as well the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590 
adjustment on the high back as well the
power<00:01:00.840> triangle<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.829> great<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
power triangle is great because it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
power triangle is great because it
offers<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> stability<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.670> heel

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
offers a lot of stability on your heel

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
offers a lot of stability on your heel
side<00:01:05.850> edge<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.670> pretty<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.820> brings<00:01:09.240> up

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
side edge and pretty much just brings up

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
side edge and pretty much just brings up
a<00:01:09.510> whole<00:01:09.540> structural<00:01:10.080> integrity<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.710> this

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a whole structural integrity of this

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.130 
a whole structural integrity of this
binding<00:01:11.189> quite<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.180> high-tension

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
binding quite a bit the high-tension

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
traditional bindings are an L shape so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.760 
traditional bindings are an L shape so
when<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> lean<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.290> heel<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:22.650> that

it's just going to be a little bit of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's just going to be a little bit of
give<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.630> high<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.930> no<00:01:25.049> matter<00:01:25.170> how<00:01:25.439> stiff

give in my high back no matter how stiff

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
give in my high back no matter how stiff
it<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> power<00:01:26.970> triangle<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it is with the power triangle in the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
high back combination that flow has when

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
high back combination that flow has when
you<00:01:30.780> lean<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.350> heel<00:01:31.500> side<00:01:31.740> edge<00:01:31.770> you're

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you lean on your heel side edge you're

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.120 
you lean on your heel side edge you're
binding<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:33.060> board<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> move

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
binding your board are going to move

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
binding your board are going to move
like<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:36.540> 3d<00:01:37.310> power<00:01:38.310> strap<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:39.110> another

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
like that the 3d power strap is another

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.480 
like that the 3d power strap is another
great<00:01:40.380> thing<00:01:40.590> about<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.979> bindings<00:01:41.369> here

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
great thing about these bindings here

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
great thing about these bindings here
their<00:01:42.479> cord<00:01:42.750> outs<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.170> gonna<00:01:43.350> save<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> lot<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
their cord outs are gonna save a lot of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.690 
their cord outs are gonna save a lot of
weight<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> piece<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.700> fairly

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
weight but because the piece is fairly

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
shaped the way that your board is when

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.940 
shaped the way that your board is when
you<00:02:22.830> ride<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.280> flexion<00:02:23.580> board<00:02:24.379> they<00:02:25.379> reduced<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
you ride in flexion board they reduced a

you don't has a flex rating of on a 4.5

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.259 
you don't has a flex rating of on a 4.5
so<00:02:43.500> pretty<00:02:43.980> stiff<00:02:44.160> binding<00:02:44.489> great<00:02:44.790> freestyle
