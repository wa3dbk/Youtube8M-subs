00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
want to go back to check now but yeah

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.950 
want to go back to check now but yeah
it's<00:03:26.340> pretty<00:03:26.460> cool<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.700> they<00:03:26.880> have<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
it's pretty cool that they have the the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.360 
it's pretty cool that they have the the
feeds<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.530> streets<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:28.980> there<00:03:29.130> as

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
feeds like the streets in there as

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.850 
feeds like the streets in there as
metals<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.720> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.960> tell<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.710> got

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
metals so we can kind of tell if you got

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.890 
metals so we can kind of tell if you got
a<00:03:31.890> quad<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.490> if<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.820> sometimes<00:03:33.330> there's

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
a quad or if you know sometimes there's

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.390 
a quad or if you know sometimes there's
been<00:03:34.080> quads<00:03:34.320> I've<00:03:34.530> gotten<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.950> past<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
been quads I've gotten in the past that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670 
been quads I've gotten in the past that
I<00:03:35.460> didn't<00:03:35.700> even<00:03:35.790> realize<00:03:36.780> until<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.230> went<00:03:37.470> back

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
I didn't even realize until I went back

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.200 
I didn't even realize until I went back
and<00:03:37.860> checked<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.400> oh<00:03:38.490> wow<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:39.030> was<00:03:39.150> a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
and checked I was like oh wow that was a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.490 
and checked I was like oh wow that was a
quad<00:03:39.570> feet<00:03:39.750> or<00:03:39.840> whatever<00:03:40.050> because<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:40.410> know

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
quad feet or whatever because you know

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.840 
quad feet or whatever because you know
in<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.800> moment<00:03:41.250> you're<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.370> you're<00:03:41.820> just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
in the moment you're just you're just

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.110 
in the moment you're just you're just
jumping<00:03:42.510> around<00:03:42.660> going<00:03:42.960> crazy<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:44.460> have

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
jumping around going crazy but I have

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.540 
jumping around going crazy but I have
the<00:03:45.630> dogs<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.260> swarm<00:03:46.590> just<00:03:47.160> go<00:03:47.310> ham

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
the dogs and the swarm just go ham

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.000 
the dogs and the swarm just go ham
especially<00:03:48.210> on<00:03:48.240> small<00:03:49.020> maps<00:03:49.260> where<00:03:49.920> they

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
especially on small maps where they

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.410 
especially on small maps where they
can't<00:03:50.220> really<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.580> know<00:03:50.700> camp<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.240> shoot

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
can't really you know camp and shoot

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.750 
can't really you know camp and shoot
your<00:03:51.510> dogs<00:03:51.720> down<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.170> uh<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.920> yeah<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.160> mean<00:03:53.250> on

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
your dogs down but uh but yeah I mean on

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.180 
your dogs down but uh but yeah I mean on
this<00:03:53.850> map<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:55.530> sponsor<00:03:56.010> just

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
this map is just the sponsor just

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.590 
this map is just the sponsor just
flipping<00:03:56.520> back<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.700> forth<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.330> I'm<00:03:57.390> running

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
flipping back and forth and I'm running

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.000 
flipping back and forth and I'm running
back<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.050> forth<00:03:58.080> that<00:03:58.410> would<00:03:58.560> have<00:03:58.650> got<00:03:58.770> more

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
back and forth that would have got more

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.320 
back and forth that would have got more
kills<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.700> probably<00:03:59.910> could<00:04:00.090> have<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:00.300> a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
kills and I probably could have got a

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.000 
kills and I probably could have got a
nuclear<00:04:00.750> five<00:04:01.110> wasn't<00:04:01.530> running<00:04:01.710> around<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
nuclear five wasn't running around the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.410 
nuclear five wasn't running around the
whole<00:04:02.070> time<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:02.490> that's<00:04:03.060> how<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.210> is

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
whole time but that's how it is

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.600 
whole time but that's how it is
sometimes<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.020> oh<00:04:04.310> yeah<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> got<00:04:05.490> the

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
sometimes so oh yeah I got the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.890 
sometimes so oh yeah I got the
relentless<00:04:05.970> medal<00:04:06.270> on<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.750> would

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
know I would like to get a nuclear medal

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.720 
know I would like to get a nuclear medal
and<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.140> I'm<00:04:22.350> gonna<00:04:22.470> maybe<00:04:23.190> start<00:04:23.520> going

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
and I think I'm gonna maybe start going

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.380 
and I think I'm gonna maybe start going
for<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.000> pretty<00:04:24.180> soon<00:04:25.580> but<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.790> ultra<00:04:27.180> kill

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
for it pretty soon but the ultra kill

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:28.940 
for it pretty soon but the ultra kill
which<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.870> all<00:04:28.200> i<00:04:28.290> get<00:04:28.440> i<00:04:28.470> don't<00:04:28.680> know<00:04:28.740> how<00:04:28.920> i

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
which is all i get i don't know how i

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.740 
which is all i get i don't know how i
didn't<00:04:29.220> die<00:04:29.310> right<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.670> guy<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:30.000> bad

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
didn't die right that guy is just bad

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.230 
didn't die right that guy is just bad
but<00:04:30.990> ultra<00:04:31.680> kills<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.430> next<00:04:32.640> one<00:04:32.760> up<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.120> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
but ultra kills the next one up it's the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.450 
but ultra kills the next one up it's the
eight<00:04:33.360> kills<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.840> row<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.170> now<00:04:34.950> i<00:04:34.980> would

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
eight kills in a row and now i would

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.950 
eight kills in a row and now i would
actually<00:04:35.880> want<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.090> get<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.390> first<00:04:36.630> i'll

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
actually want to get that first i'll

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.320 
actually want to get that first i'll
probably<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.710> that<00:04:37.860> more<00:04:38.370> than<00:04:38.580> nucular

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
probably go for that more than nucular

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.840 
probably go for that more than nucular
but<00:04:39.630> um<00:04:39.780> yeah<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.890> end<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.490> gameplay<00:04:41.790> is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
but um yeah the end of the gameplay is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.700 
but um yeah the end of the gameplay is
winding<00:04:42.060> down<00:04:42.180> right<00:04:42.480> here<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.690> I'm<00:04:43.140> just<00:04:43.380> I'm

just looking for people to kill they're

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.600 
just looking for people to kill they're
