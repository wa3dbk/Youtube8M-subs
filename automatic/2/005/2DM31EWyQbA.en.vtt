00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
thing so what I think is cute about this
design<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> fact<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.459> snowman<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
design is the fact that the snowman is

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.690 
design is the fact that the snowman is
an<00:02:09.390> outlined<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.830> you'd<00:02:10.979> rather<00:02:11.190> outline

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
an outlined and if you'd rather outline

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
an outlined and if you'd rather outline
him<00:02:11.940> that's<00:02:12.209> fine<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
him that's fine but I like

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
him that's fine but I like
it<00:02:13.590> looks<00:02:13.740> with<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.370> little<00:02:14.490> snowman<00:02:14.970> face

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.589 

so<00:03:39.129> I<00:03:39.159> love<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.610> way<00:03:39.700> these<00:03:39.849> teardrops<00:03:40.420> look

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
so I love the way these teardrops look

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.360 
so I love the way these teardrops look
with<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> blue<00:03:40.989> background<00:03:41.019> because<00:03:41.920> there<00:03:42.250> is

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
with a blue background because there is

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.220 
with a blue background because there is
start<00:03:42.640> bright<00:03:42.940> white<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.690> they<00:03:43.810> fade

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
start bright white and then they fade

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.630 
start bright white and then they fade
into<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> blue<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.159> think<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.549> looks

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
