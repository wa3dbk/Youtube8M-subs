00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
out there it's been a while since I've

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.700 
out there it's been a while since I've
come<00:00:11.460> across<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.790> theory<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:13.259> would<00:00:13.590> like

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
come across a theory that I would like

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.950 
come across a theory that I would like
to<00:00:13.769> change<00:00:14.130> up<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.639> add<00:00:14.790> my<00:00:14.969> own<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.389> cents<00:00:15.719> or

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
to change up or add my own two cents or

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.349 
to change up or add my own two cents or
completely<00:00:16.590> debunk<00:00:17.250> that's<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> like<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
completely debunk that's how I like to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.480 
completely debunk that's how I like to
do<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.750> theories<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> look<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.310> ones

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
do my theories I like to look at ones

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.980 
do my theories I like to look at ones
that<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:20.760> already<00:00:20.970> been<00:00:21.210> made<00:00:21.630> because

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
that have already been made because

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
that have already been made because
there<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.410> many<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.460> feel<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> way

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
there are so many I feel like this way

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
there are so many I feel like this way
you<00:00:24.180> should<00:00:24.269> start<00:00:24.750> things<00:00:25.320> should<00:00:25.529> break

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you should start things should break

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859 
you should start things should break
downs<00:00:26.039> ones<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.240> already<00:00:27.510> been

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
downs ones that have already been

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.640 
downs ones that have already been
prepared<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.130> presented<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:31.529> know

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
prepared and presented and you know

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
prepared and presented and you know
explain<00:00:32.189> whether<00:00:32.399> wrong<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.350> that's<00:00:34.350> what<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
explain whether wrong and that's what I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.049 
explain whether wrong and that's what I
do<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> doing<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.760> this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
do and that's what I'm doing here this

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.069 
do and that's what I'm doing here this
one<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> super<00:00:37.350> common<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.809> but<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
one is not a super common one but it is

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.500 
one is not a super common one but it is
out<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.320> I've<00:00:41.219> seen<00:00:41.489> videos<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> I've

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
out there I've seen videos on it I've

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
out there I've seen videos on it I've
read<00:00:43.079> about<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.800> something<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
read about it it's something that

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
read about it it's something that
circulated<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
circulated some but it's not one of the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.479 
circulated some but it's not one of the
main<00:00:47.420> frontrunners<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:50.070> still<00:00:50.309> an

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
main frontrunners but it's still an

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.150 
main frontrunners but it's still an
intriguing<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.110> personally<00:00:52.949> do

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
intriguing one to me and I personally do

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
intriguing one to me and I personally do
not<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.030> has<00:00:54.120> been<00:00:54.329> looked<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.809> or

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
not think that it has been looked at or

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.099 
not think that it has been looked at or
worked<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:56.340> thought<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.809> its

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
worked on or thought about in its

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.439 
worked on or thought about in its
entirety<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:59.100> feel<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.699> people<00:00:59.760> reach<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
entirety I feel like people reach the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
entirety I feel like people reach the
conclusion<00:01:00.629> too<00:01:01.170> quick<00:01:01.469> without<00:01:01.739> really

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
conclusion too quick without really

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
conclusion too quick without really
assessing<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> building<00:01:04.439> blocks<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
assessing all of the building blocks of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
assessing all of the building blocks of
it<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.540> theory<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:07.220> what<00:01:08.220> world<00:01:08.869> exactly

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it and that theory is what world exactly

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.890 
it and that theory is what world exactly
does<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.340> events<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.909> Pokemon<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.810> all

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
does all the events in Pokemon and all

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
does all the events in Pokemon and all
the<00:01:13.080> characters<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.189> Pokemon

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the characters and the Pokemon

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.749 
the characters and the Pokemon
themselves<00:01:15.150> take<00:01:15.360> place<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.680> where<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
themselves take place in where where the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.240 
themselves take place in where where the
 where<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.750> enough<00:01:19.259> earth<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.860> another

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
 where is enough earth or another

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
 where is enough earth or another
planet<00:01:20.909> well<00:01:21.479> let's<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
planet well let's take a look at the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
planet well let's take a look at the
evidence<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.909> thoughts<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.990> let's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
evidence and my thoughts so let's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.399 
evidence and my thoughts so let's
deconstruct<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.189> most<00:01:26.460> common<00:01:27.000> conclusion

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
deconstruct the most common conclusion

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.890 
deconstruct the most common conclusion
that<00:01:28.409> people<00:01:28.770> seem<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> arrive<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.900> most

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
that people seem to arrive at most

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
that people seem to arrive at most
people<00:01:31.259> seem<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> conclude<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.939> all

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
people seem to conclude that it all

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.780 
people seem to conclude that it all
happens<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.780> our<00:01:33.990> earth<00:01:34.640> obviously<00:01:35.640> not

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
happens on our earth obviously not

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
happens on our earth obviously not
during<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.299> time<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:38.100> earth<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
during our time but on our earth and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.640 
during our time but on our earth and
this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> why<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.020> because

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
this is why they think that because

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800 
this is why they think that because
there<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.250> references<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.850> both<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> anime

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
there are references in both the anime

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.249 
there are references in both the anime
and<00:01:43.110> games<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.280> places<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.240> offense<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.930> our

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and games to places and offense on our

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.149 
and games to places and offense on our
earth<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.770> art<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> life<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
earth in art to life time and then you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
earth in art to life time and then you
know<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.520> come<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.840> then

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know they come up with that and then

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
know they come up with that and then
that's<00:01:52.439> where<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.920> their<00:01:53.100> theory

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that's where they in their theory

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.889 
that's where they in their theory
they're<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.869> is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they're like that right there is

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
they're like that right there is
evidence<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> happened<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.460> earth

conclusion is debunked right there if

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.890 
conclusion is debunked right there if
you<00:02:43.709> conclude<00:02:44.129> just<00:02:44.730> based<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.269> references

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you conclude just based on references

that everything happens on this earth it
just<00:02:49.739> doesn't<00:02:50.040> add<00:02:50.099> up<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.879> debunk<00:02:51.359> on<00:02:52.109> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
just doesn't add up that's debunk on to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.580 
just doesn't add up that's debunk on to
the<00:02:52.709> next<00:02:52.950> idea<00:02:53.400> okay<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.900> my<00:02:55.290> thought
