those<00:06:10.890> back<00:06:11.190> so<00:06:11.550> I<00:06:11.580> guess<00:06:11.820> I<00:06:12.000> could<00:06:12.180> use<00:06:12.390> that

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930

those back so I guess I could use that
one<00:06:13.140> sheet<00:06:13.380> when<00:06:13.620> she<00:06:14.040> gets<00:06:14.190> back<00:06:14.570> that's

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
one sheet when she gets back that's

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.540
