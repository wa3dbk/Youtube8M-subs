00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:09.180
 good morning I love you how to make 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.180
 another eonia as a flat center 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.090
 we take a napkin we open it 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.010
 completely begin to bend 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:25.119
 the corner 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 so taking care to leave the 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.240
 sign again 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.570
 a simple and very nice idea 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.449
 you have to be very careful to close 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.470
 well here the corners otherwise will come 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.470
 bad again 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.880
 well 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.720
 let's continue the process in this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.720
 way 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 always in the same way 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.619
 we continue another round 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.640
 yet 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:13.230
 be careful to close the le 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.720
 bends a slight pressure on the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.970
 corners so that it should not be reopened 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.540
 again 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.570
 watch over and continue for the last one 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.570
 time 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.769
 we close very very well 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.770
 and let's start 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.250
 let's get out 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.310
 the angles behind this 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.310
 way 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.140
 right them with your hands 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.280
 and we do it here too 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.530
 our hundred plate rejection 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.030
 to make ours more pleasant 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.690
 flower we can put something to his 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.690
 internal and lay our journey
