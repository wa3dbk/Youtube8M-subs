 benfica defending champion does not come 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.420

 of the Abruzzese flag it is called fasoli 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.210
 the Rome is advised and will have to take into account 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 also of the factor linked to the difference 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 networks in group b 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 great enterprise of the novara of mister 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.440
 fusaro that bends deservedly the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.910
 Dutch Ajax start the race are 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 immediately the Piedmontese to create a ball 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 goals but beretta and renato are hindered 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.719
 the ajax pushes a lot on the lane of 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.440
 right with zamani but never fails to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.140
 kick a net 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.629
 so from the douglas pitch ring he puts in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 moto andriolo that unlocks the match 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.809
 forward 3 to 0 thanks to the other goals from 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 cassettes on the development of punishment 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.030
 of renolfi and reina do that capitalizes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 a restart with the ajax unbalanced the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 cute douglas outdoor lancers pole 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.930
 that in the second half grow and create

 until you find the goal with ian sana bus e 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 however the novara does not accuse the coup e 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 with year he finds a rigor that comes 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 realized by rosselli the goal in the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.540
 recovery of benz allan sets the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 result on 4 to 2 4 goals also for the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.970
 turin 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.770
 however the match with the Urbe Tiber 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.299
 very balanced merit of the Romans of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.159
 brunelli who before going under 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.439

 of capuano on pepper shake 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 the bull is lethal when it starts e 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.880
 masiello confirms it at the eighteenth of the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 first time in the urban shooting 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.479

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.110
 they run out of gasoline and then the turin 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 he takes advantage of it to get back in the lead 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.670

 to the goal that shortens the distance where it was 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.240
 of catapano that punishes the error of 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.890
 zanellato and the 32nd and no longer exists

 round d 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.290
 the game finds it hard to take off and lives one 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.490
 long study phase at the end of the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.140
 which the Spaniards bring in 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.550
 advantage with the other ferrer 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.270
 signing of remigi closed for a corner 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.430

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.640
 a crossbar with herrera and then spreads 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.739
 up to the pokerissimo 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.450
 the other three networks carry the signature of 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.640
 rodriguez france es 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.800
 wonderful his left- handed and orkin volleys 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.270
 that they turn a performance in which it is 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.890
 emerged as the valencia is able to 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.020
 match with a reasoned ball possession 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.610
 of lethal verticalizations that 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.320
 reward the constant movements without 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.770
 ball of the three midfielders and the point 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.650
 central

 home of the racing club for 1 to 0 la 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.450
 but the departure of the cubes is more than that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.830
 convincing so much so that the sixth moral has 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.720
 on the right an important ball that 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.400
 kicks high the Giallorossi make the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.690
 match and have a constant change 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.910

 man with ease from their boys 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.180
 of franz and besides to occupy well the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.500
 spaces can count on a manasse 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.150
 very reliable 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.739
 the first half final sees the king 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.930
 dangerous silvio with the punishment d 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.550
 abundo while the rome at half an hour 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.930
 finds the penalty kick thanks to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.970
 percussion of cangiano that comes 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.410
 landed by riccardi scrimeri 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.270
 turns 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.620
 the goal then the certainties of racing that 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.090
 continues a race ordered but less 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.100
 present in the last sixteen meters 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.959
 the rome instead fits with more 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.970
 ease the Giallorossi try then 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.100
 from the distance with riccardi still of 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.260
 priest but manasse exalts himself and that the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.060
 float its long to zero final rewards 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.070
 a brilliant Rome with tactical ideas already 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.300
 clear while the racing passed the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.160
 baptism of the nardoni with a 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.010
 more than convincing performance can 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.630
 have your say in the last two matches a lot 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.000
 complicated barcelona's debut

 perfect samp in the first half 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.270
 organized on double that though 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.050
