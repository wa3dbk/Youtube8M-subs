00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.340
 it has a little bit here 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:24.390
 all of course seriously disappointed 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.390
 made great game I think make the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.000
 but I can not really blame 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.360
 when you give light and you do it 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 important what was crucial 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.300
 In the end, the classic question is mine 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.650
 of course, I keep my what 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.269
 I tell times in my view of the very 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.720
 just too much space around the time 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.589
 clear the ball again I mean 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.269
 the decisive factor is not the goal 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.970
 but rather the effectiveness of us 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.659
 the second half a bit 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.579
 was missing 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.280
 guys have even chances 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.420
 played out that's why 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.890
 difference between youth and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.039
 Amateur area and professional area from the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.149
 learning to fail for the future and me 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.970
 think you saw that the boys 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.130
 all about football are all very 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.140
 talented and actually allowed one 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 future 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 did you have the feeling that the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.880
 Team at the beginning maybe that was 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.880
 for many 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.500
 but I think 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.450
 but that is actually gone because of that 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.580
 So most of us do not have that good 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.710
 Run ball more game shares 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.760
 in possession 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.780
 that affects his or her standards dangerous 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:50.360
 have become comparison to the game of chance 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.220
 other games started today so found 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.970
 I quite similar so also this open 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.650
 visor again 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.960
 then I found it was something else 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.020
 play openly addressed that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.590
 second goal was missing then sometime 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.400
 it was too much too little anyway 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.260
 you could have gotten further the Chinese 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.560
 I can not simulate anyone 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:25.630
 controlled 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:25.630
 the better team 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.000
 that means I mean the evening south 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.770
 Wanted well over either 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 have a farewell dinner or one 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.270
 Ascension celebration in the descent food and the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.810
 relatively modest conditions the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:59.070
 music is so negative when 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:01.680
 I am behind at the shooting year 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:08.459
 he did not start is mine 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:12.380
 first regional league bavaria twice so 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.380
 close together now 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.959
 Going out again, how do you get players? 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.209
 out of his hole brought out 80 points 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.450
 become master and now fail 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 six minutes later ask like that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.090
 stopped is the idea had completely 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.090
 New 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.209
 I have from the part I my boys 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.069
 player every driver already characterized 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.910
 learn and then I think the guys are 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.920
 so consolidated that denser 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.040
 of course, had a special task 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.000
 that you're asked the boys too 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.000
 to console 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.349
 the whole time it's looking that is it 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.560
 simply beautiful this year evening 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.560
 go out that it goes on
