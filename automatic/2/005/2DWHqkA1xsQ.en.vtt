00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
in the mail got it from skate warehouse

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.110 
in the mail got it from skate warehouse
you<00:00:07.890> get<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.189> overnight<00:00:08.610> if<00:00:08.760> you're<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.000> the

golden Golden State area and yeah this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.419 
golden Golden State area and yeah this
is<00:00:12.389> looking<00:00:13.019> pretty<00:00:13.200> good<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:14.009> bad<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.340> all

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is looking pretty good not bad at all

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.460 
is looking pretty good not bad at all
let's<00:00:14.670> go<00:00:14.820> look<00:00:15.240> through<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.139> got<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
let's go look through it so we got the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.640 
let's go look through it so we got the
mini<00:00:16.650> logo<00:00:17.160> riser<00:00:17.760> pads<00:00:18.260> pretty<00:00:19.260> much<00:00:19.410> just

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
mini logo riser pads pretty much just

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
mini logo riser pads pretty much just
like<00:00:19.770> shocks<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.300> know<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:21.990> deck

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
like shocks so that you know your deck

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.330 
like shocks so that you know your deck
and<00:00:22.590> trucks<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
and trucks can have a little bit of a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.279 
and trucks can have a little bit of a
energy<00:00:26.340> absorption<00:00:26.670> between<00:00:27.119> them<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
energy absorption between them so you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.460 
energy absorption between them so you
need<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.279> those<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:30.869> gotta<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.260> your

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
need to have those you gotta have your

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.120 
need to have those you gotta have your
nuts<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> bolts<00:00:32.610> pretty<00:00:33.210> much<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.130> formula

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
nuts and bolts pretty much the formula

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.690 
nuts and bolts pretty much the formula
to<00:00:35.280> keeping<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.760> your<00:00:36.690> complete<00:00:37.050> together

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
to keeping your your complete together

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.110 
to keeping your your complete together
and<00:00:38.700> I've<00:00:39.270> picked<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:40.070> bearings<00:00:41.120> $8.00

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I've picked up some bearings $8.00

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.139 
and I've picked up some bearings $8.00
bearings<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.629> big<00:00:42.809> five<00:00:43.430> rubber<00:00:44.430> shielded<00:00:45.000> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
bearings a big five rubber shielded I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
bearings a big five rubber shielded I
really<00:00:45.809> recommend<00:00:46.260> bones<00:00:46.440> bones<00:00:47.039> reds<00:00:47.370> are

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
really recommend bones bones reds are

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
really recommend bones bones reds are
better<00:00:47.820> than<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> probably<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.260> there's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
better than this probably but there's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
better than this probably but there's
bull<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:49.980> good<00:00:50.129> oh<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.270> these<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.570> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I was gonna get like black base plate

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
I was gonna get like black base plate
but<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.729> why<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.840> same

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
stereo deck pretty clean pop by Riemann

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.510 
stereo deck pretty clean pop by Riemann
I<00:02:36.000> don't<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:37.739> yeah<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.400> know

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
I don't know that is but yeah you know

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.790 
I don't know that is but yeah you know
let's<00:02:39.480> check<00:02:39.540> out<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> pop<00:02:40.050> concave<00:02:44.780> concave

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
let's check out the pop concave concave

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.150 
let's check out the pop concave concave
not<00:02:46.800> looking<00:02:47.280> too<00:02:47.459> bad<00:02:48.800> make<00:02:49.800> sure<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
not looking too bad make sure all the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.600 
not looking too bad make sure all the
corners<00:02:50.489> are<00:02:50.580> pretty<00:02:50.820> equivalent<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:53.280> know<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
corners are pretty equivalent you know I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.920 
corners are pretty equivalent you know I
think<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.000> different<00:02:54.450> from<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.660> tail<00:02:54.870> on

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
think it's different from the tail on

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.990 
think it's different from the tail on
the<00:02:54.959> nose<00:02:55.170> though<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.620> believe<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> concave<00:02:56.820> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
the nose though I believe the concave is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.460 
the nose though I believe the concave is
always<00:02:57.180> gonna<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.260> Testim<00:02:58.680> nose

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
always gonna be very from Testim nose

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.430 
always gonna be very from Testim nose
tail<00:03:01.470> concave<00:03:01.920> check<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> other<00:03:02.640> side<00:03:03.440> make

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
tail concave check the other side make

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.580 
tail concave check the other side make
sure<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> other<00:03:04.800> side<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.130> okay<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.319> looks

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
sure the other side is okay and it looks

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.990 
sure the other side is okay and it looks
like<00:03:09.080> yeah<00:03:10.080> look<00:03:10.380> at<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.500> very<00:03:11.160> very<00:03:11.610> even

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
like yeah look at that very very even

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.490 
like yeah look at that very very even
concave<00:03:13.519> even<00:03:14.519> concave<00:03:14.970> pretty<00:03:15.300> unit<00:03:15.569> because

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
concave even concave pretty unit because

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.069 
concave even concave pretty unit because
even<00:03:16.830> yeah<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:17.910> looks<00:03:18.060> good<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.600> ready<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.930> run
