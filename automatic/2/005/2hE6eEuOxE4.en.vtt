00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 hello I have found a new way 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 yes and he works after the patch 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.890
 So on the page it works, so to speak 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:41.489
 today is the twentieth november 2010 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.510
 but after the patch after the 16 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.039
 the patch was close to 16 and has 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 I do not know over yet 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.329
 is longer outside I have it now 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.600
 time today and have him the same 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 tried and he works so what 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:06.330
 he needs it the sdl hit the latte and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.799
 you can then upload yourself 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.299
 download you go on your patcher 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:22.560
 or on the link and just go 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:25.939
 Open files then cdu the fsx s.de 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 I have already done leyen here 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.799
 and then you can do the patch normally 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.799
 start 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:59.229
 what can because it is quite noticeable 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.110
 therefore only short distances were 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 my little tip I have so 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:16.239
 me so best what else can 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.730
 So no channel of the match live what 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.890
 I do not know how it works 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.800
 works as I thought 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 did not work then yes that is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.019
 was the sound now 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.190
 it always comes to do though 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.200
 really should not sound like that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:45.070
 normally you come a beep and that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.970
 means then that the hack is activated there 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.970
 comes so when blocking 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.220
 I do not want that well 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.579
 so 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:13.770
 so I got you the 16 700 and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.770
 the dual and all strike are changing 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.100
 the alley is also now I have 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.100
 a m 41 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:33.329
 you see then I have the m 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.500
 the alley digital and normal granada cf 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.500
 to come 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:53.390
 okay that was the way the depp changes now 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.390
 Switzerland is even more rationed here 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.440
 Oh yes 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:21.640
 then there is just still being changed to 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.640
 Meeting and the dual core CPU half day 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.220
 so can the human 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:41.270
 So now I have a clear one too 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.860
 but made only for joy and yes 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.030
 So no forgiveness 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.030
 you see 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:07.280
 So automatically sorry for her 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.280
 since the years get along faster 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:23.570
 yes , a little too long 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.989
 can I you show the same again 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.929
 that was it already 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:55.589
 and did not stop at that 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:58.169
 end to a conspicuous 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:03.259
 the only thing on this day 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.259
 it is noticeable that the speed 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.960
 something so fast after that but in the country 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:24.280
 everyone else sees them as normal 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:26.820
 surname as well as you see you see the 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.820
 ghosts 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.240
 Yes 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.450
 nothing special besides that 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.450
 sees ghosts 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.080
 that was it already 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:56.850
 So I hope you subscribe to field hedges 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:01.590
 so me much more text it happened 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:04.040
 if new 6000 are and yes then until the 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.040
 next time
