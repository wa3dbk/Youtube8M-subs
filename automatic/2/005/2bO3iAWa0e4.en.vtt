00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
actually make the final cut and as you

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.830 
actually make the final cut and as you
can<00:00:55.090> see<00:00:55.150> I<00:00:55.950> got<00:00:56.950> my<00:00:57.010> my<00:00:57.640> tail<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.330> my<00:00:58.540> nose

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
can see I got my my tail here my nose

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.010 
can see I got my my tail here my nose
and<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.850> order<00:01:01.120> for<00:01:01.150> me<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.390> get<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.630> horizontal

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
and in order for me to get a horizontal

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.270 
and in order for me to get a horizontal
camber<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.960> each<00:01:05.320> sheet<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.740> paper<00:01:05.920> just

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
camber I make each sheet of paper just

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.660 
camber I make each sheet of paper just
slightly<00:01:07.290> slightly<00:01:08.290> taller<00:01:08.799> or<00:01:09.130> shorter<00:01:09.159> than

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
slightly slightly taller or shorter than

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.289 
slightly slightly taller or shorter than
the<00:01:09.759> previous<00:01:10.210> one<00:01:10.450> so<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.590> um<00:01:11.829> I<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:13.180> get

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
the previous one so that um I can get

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.239 
the previous one so that um I can get
that<00:01:13.390> horizontal<00:01:14.140> curve<00:01:14.499> in<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:14.770> wood<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.189> it

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
that horizontal curve in the wood as it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.069 
that horizontal curve in the wood as it
goes<00:01:16.469> primp<00:01:17.469> edge<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:17.799> edge<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.569> see<00:01:19.569> here<00:01:19.960> I

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
goes primp edge to edge and see here I

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.370 
goes primp edge to edge and see here I
will<00:01:20.380> draw<00:01:20.740> each<00:01:21.659> draw<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.719> out<00:01:22.869> on<00:01:23.020> each<00:01:23.170> piece

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
will draw each draw it out on each piece

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.910 
will draw each draw it out on each piece
of<00:01:23.409> wood<00:01:23.560> make<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.670> cut<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.149> then<00:01:25.929> stack<00:01:26.590> them

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
of wood make the cut and then stack them

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.590 
of wood make the cut and then stack them
all<00:01:27.100> together<00:01:28.079> as<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.590> see<00:01:29.859> here<00:01:30.429> I<00:01:30.609> guess

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
all together as you can see here I guess

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.319 
all together as you can see here I guess
give<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> better<00:01:32.020> explanation<00:01:32.109> see<00:01:33.039> how<00:01:33.329> see

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
give a better explanation see how see

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.679 
give a better explanation see how see
how<00:01:34.509> each<00:01:34.719> piece<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.229> just<00:01:35.439> slightly<00:01:36.689> higher

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
how each piece is just slightly higher

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:38.940 
how each piece is just slightly higher
than<00:01:37.719> the<00:01:38.079> last<00:01:38.259> one<00:01:38.560> that's<00:01:38.770> what<00:01:38.859> I'm

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
than the last one that's what I'm

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.749

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
about to cut out my first piece with a

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.129 
about to cut out my first piece with a
jigsaw<00:01:46.569> that's<00:01:46.899> all<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.829> have<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.429> works<00:01:48.609> fine

old came out pretty well not too worried
about<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.940> little<00:02:13.270> offsets<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.900> guys<00:02:14.050> can

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
about the little offsets you guys can

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.400 
about the little offsets you guys can
see<00:02:14.530> there<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:16.180> next<00:02:16.390> step<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.959> sand<00:02:17.140> those

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
see there the next step is to sand those

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.280 
see there the next step is to sand those
down<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
down and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.949 
down and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.399 
smooth it out I'll show you guys the
little<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.129> guess

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
little I guess

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.750 
little I guess
horizontal<00:02:24.409> camber<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.739> was<00:02:24.920> talking<00:02:25.250> about<00:02:25.489> I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
horizontal camber I was talking about I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.670 
horizontal camber I was talking about I
was<00:02:26.359> a<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.599> bit<00:02:26.719> lower<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.170> center<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
was a little bit lower in the center and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.520 
was a little bit lower in the center and
a<00:02:28.209> kind<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.299> increases<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:29.900> side<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.409> give

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
a kind of increases on the side to give

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.670 
a kind of increases on the side to give
you<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:31.420> kind<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.659> you<00:02:32.870> concave<00:02:33.439> on<00:02:33.469> the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
you a kind of a you concave on the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.679 
you a kind of a you concave on the
center<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> stand<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.750> um<00:02:37.239> yeah<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.569> is

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
center to stand on um yeah here it is

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.860 
center to stand on um yeah here it is
from<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> side<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.790> looking<00:02:41.090> pretty<00:02:41.209> good

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.460 

yeah<00:02:44.870> there's<00:02:45.439> no<00:02:49.780> all<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.200> they're<00:02:51.349> all

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
yeah there's no all right so they're all

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.610 
yeah there's no all right so they're all
done<00:02:51.730> everything's<00:02:52.730> screwed<00:02:52.970> together<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
done everything's screwed together and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.659 
done everything's screwed together and
the<00:02:54.739> next<00:02:54.889> step<00:02:55.189> is<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:56.769> cover<00:02:57.769> up<00:02:57.980> these<00:02:58.220> last

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
the next step is to cover up these last

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.089 
the next step is to cover up these last
tiny<00:02:59.090> cracks<00:02:59.569> and<00:03:00.109> get<00:03:00.319> everything<00:03:00.680> just

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
tiny cracks and get everything just

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.920 
tiny cracks and get everything just
perfectly<00:03:02.709> even<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.040> smooth<00:03:04.510> let's<00:03:05.510> do<00:03:05.780> that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
perfectly even and smooth let's do that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.179 
perfectly even and smooth let's do that
I'm<00:03:06.139> going<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.379> use<00:03:06.439> this<00:03:07.750> flex<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:09.159> spread<00:03:10.159> it

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
I'm going to use this flex all spread it

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.390 
I'm going to use this flex all spread it
on<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:10.669> sand<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.150> down<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:12.650> got<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.189> at

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
on then sand it down and I got this at

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.869 
on then sand it down and I got this at
Home<00:03:13.549> Depot<00:03:13.579> it's<00:03:14.180> not<00:03:14.389> too<00:03:14.629> expensive<00:03:18.879> all

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
Home Depot it's not too expensive all

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.000 
Home Depot it's not too expensive all
right<00:03:20.000> here's<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.299> completed<00:03:20.870> mold<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.590> Flex

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
right here's the completed mold the Flex

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.210 
right here's the completed mold the Flex
saw<00:03:22.220> was<00:03:22.459> left<00:03:22.729> to<00:03:22.849> dry<00:03:23.120> for<00:03:23.989> five<00:03:24.470> or<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:24.829> hours

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
saw was left to dry for five or so hours

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.330 
saw was left to dry for five or so hours
and<00:03:25.459> then<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.359> sanded<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.019> down<00:03:27.349> which<00:03:28.129> will

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
and then I sanded that down which will

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.819 
and then I sanded that down which will
use<00:03:28.519> all<00:03:28.760> these<00:03:28.909> little<00:03:29.239> white<00:03:29.989> splotches<00:03:30.409> all

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
use all these little white splotches all

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.770 
use all these little white splotches all
over<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:31.220> place<00:03:31.430> but<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.329> white<00:03:32.479> splotches

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
over the place but the white splotches

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.199 
over the place but the white splotches
are<00:03:33.139> actually<00:03:33.500> filling<00:03:33.799> in<00:03:34.099> any<00:03:34.430> gaps<00:03:34.579> or

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
are actually filling in any gaps or

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.629 
are actually filling in any gaps or
little<00:03:35.919> divots<00:03:36.919> that<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:37.129> might<00:03:37.370> have<00:03:37.400> made

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
little divots that I might have made

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.300 
little divots that I might have made
when<00:03:37.849> I<00:03:37.879> was<00:03:37.909> sanding<00:03:38.479> so<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.709> everything<00:03:40.159> is

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
when I was sanding so now everything is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.159 
when I was sanding so now everything is
filled<00:03:40.579> in<00:03:40.729> and<00:03:40.849> perfectly<00:03:41.329> smoothed<00:03:41.690> out<00:03:41.870> I

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
filled in and perfectly smoothed out I

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.800 
filled in and perfectly smoothed out I
sand<00:03:43.129> it<00:03:43.220> down<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:43.699> it's<00:03:43.849> smooth<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.510> flex

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
sand it down so it's smooth and the flex

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.129 
sand it down so it's smooth and the flex
all<00:03:45.019> made<00:03:45.379> quite<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.769> mess<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.060> what<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.569> did<00:03:47.900> is

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
all made quite a mess so I what I did is

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.490 
all made quite a mess so I what I did is
I<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.590> put<00:03:48.799> a<00:03:48.829> thin<00:03:49.400> layer<00:03:49.639> of<00:03:49.699> sealer<00:03:50.329> on<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
I just put a thin layer of sealer on the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.140 
I just put a thin layer of sealer on the
wood<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.159> it<00:03:52.280> doesn't<00:03:52.609> get<00:03:52.699> all<00:03:52.819> over<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
wood so that it doesn't get all over the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.050 
wood so that it doesn't get all over the
place<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:54.680> white<00:03:54.889> flex<00:03:55.579> all<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:55.879> really

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
place the the white flex all is really

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.759 
place the the white flex all is really
dusty<00:03:56.599> so<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.620> just<00:03:58.040> sealed<00:03:58.729> that<00:03:58.940> down<00:03:59.769> but

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
dusty so I just sealed that down but

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.379 
dusty so I just sealed that down but
yeah<00:04:00.919> that's<00:04:01.220> it

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
yeah that's it

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.530 
yeah that's it
pressors<00:04:03.049> done<00:04:03.349> and<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:04.370> works<00:04:04.699> really<00:04:05.000> well<00:04:05.239> I

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
pressors done and it works really well I

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.899 
pressors done and it works really well I
actually<00:04:05.780> already<00:04:06.139> made<00:04:06.439> quite<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.430> few<00:04:07.669> boards

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
actually already made quite a few boards

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.110 
actually already made quite a few boards
with<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.359> here<00:04:09.129> here's<00:04:10.129> four<00:04:10.400> boards<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.879> made

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
with it here here's four boards I made

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.140 
with it here here's four boards I made
really<00:04:11.510> recently<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:13.549> mole<00:04:13.760> turned<00:04:14.030> out

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
really recently and the mole turned out

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.390 
really recently and the mole turned out
really<00:04:14.329> well<00:04:14.449> didn't<00:04:15.019> create<00:04:15.290> any<00:04:15.530> cracks<00:04:16.039> air

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
really well didn't create any cracks air

really well didn't create any cracks air
bubbles<00:04:16.909> or<00:04:17.000> anything<00:04:17.620> even<00:04:19.239> if<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.389> data<00:04:20.630> I
