that the cutting continues the tip is

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.109 
that the cutting continues the tip is
tapered<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:36.860> you'll<00:01:36.979> need<00:01:37.189> to<00:01:37.369> go<00:01:37.549> from<00:01:37.850> one

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
tapered so you'll need to go from one

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.499 
tapered so you'll need to go from one
side<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.399> flip<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.490> over<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.000> go<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.240> the
