today<00:00:06.629> we're<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.319> take<00:00:07.560> Katie<00:00:07.950> out<00:00:08.160> on

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
today we're going to take Katie out on

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.669 
today we're going to take Katie out on
to<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> beginner<00:00:09.150> run<00:00:09.389> again<00:00:09.719> we're<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
to the beginner run again we're going to

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.919 
to the beginner run again we're going to
get<00:00:11.160> her<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.429> make<00:00:11.790> her<00:00:11.940> parallel<00:00:12.300> turns<00:00:12.570> even

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
get her to make her parallel turns even

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.829 
get her to make her parallel turns even
better<00:00:13.110> once<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:15.179> we're<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
better once we get there we're going to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.180 
better once we get there we're going to
go<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.350> harder<00:00:16.619> terrain

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
go to some harder terrain

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
go to some harder terrain
I<00:00:17.220> expect<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.330> when<00:00:18.480> she<00:00:18.630> goes<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.020> heart

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I expect that when she goes to the heart

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.900 
I expect that when she goes to the heart
of<00:00:19.289> terrain<00:00:19.590> she's<00:00:19.890> going<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.340> revert

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
of terrain she's going to revert

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.420 
of terrain she's going to revert
slightly<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:22.529> very<00:00:22.830> normal

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
slightly that's very normal

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
slightly that's very normal
the<00:00:23.880> big<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.900> her<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> have

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the big thing is is we want her to have

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.279 
the big thing is is we want her to have
great<00:00:26.010> speed<00:00:26.340> control<00:00:26.789> by<00:00:27.660> turning<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
great speed control by turning up the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
great speed control by turning up the
hill<00:00:28.439> more<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.340> also<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:30.269> fun<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.900> being

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
hill more and also have fun with being

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.540 
hill more and also have fun with being
able<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:31.650> down<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> feel<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.250> she's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
able to go down and feel like she's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.400 
able to go down and feel like she's
really<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.940> control<00:00:35.510> after<00:00:36.510> reviewing<00:00:37.110> what

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
really in control after reviewing what

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
really in control after reviewing what
we<00:00:37.530> had<00:00:37.620> done<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> first<00:00:38.340> day<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.850> wide

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
we had done on the first day on wide

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
we had done on the first day on wide
West<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.750> worked<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.140> ways<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.559> improve

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
West we worked on ways to improve

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.520 
West we worked on ways to improve
balance<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.579> turning<00:00:41.850> even<00:00:42.210> easier

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
balance to make turning even easier

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
balance to make turning even easier
katie<00:00:43.530> improved<00:00:43.980> her<00:00:44.129> parallel<00:00:44.550> skiing<00:00:44.850> on

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
katie improved her parallel skiing on

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690 
katie improved her parallel skiing on
wide<00:00:45.239> west<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.350> proceeded<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> ride<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wide west so we proceeded to ride the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
wide west so we proceeded to ride the
carpenter<00:00:48.149> express<00:00:48.600> chairlift<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.800> top

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
carpenter express chairlift to the top

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.940 
carpenter express chairlift to the top
of<00:00:50.160> Bald<00:00:50.340> Eagle<00:00:50.640> mountain

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.620 

upon<00:00:56.950> arriving<00:00:57.490> we<00:00:57.640> started<00:00:58.060> doing<00:00:58.240> mild

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
upon arriving we started doing mild

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.660 
upon arriving we started doing mild
wedge<00:00:58.900> turns<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.560> reacquaint<00:00:59.980> Katie<00:01:00.340> with<00:01:00.580> the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
wedge turns to reacquaint Katie with the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.210 
wedge turns to reacquaint Katie with the
basics

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.820 

as<00:01:04.180> soon<00:01:04.450> as<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:04.690> got<00:01:04.870> onto<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.200> steeper<00:01:05.590> part

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
as soon as we got onto the steeper part

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.890 
as soon as we got onto the steeper part
of<00:01:05.920> success<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.550> stressed<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.180> importance<00:01:07.720> of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
of success I stressed the importance of

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.130 
of success I stressed the importance of
turning<00:01:08.290> uphill<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.860> control<00:01:09.190> speed<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
turning uphill to control speed that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.990 
turning uphill to control speed that
first<00:01:14.410> Katy<00:01:14.680> was<00:01:14.920> nervous<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.490> reverted<00:01:15.850> back

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
first Katy was nervous and reverted back

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.510 
first Katy was nervous and reverted back
to<00:01:16.150> edge<00:01:16.450> turns<00:01:16.810> as<00:01:17.440> we<00:01:17.680> continued<00:01:18.100> down<00:01:18.310> her

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
to edge turns as we continued down her

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.250 
to edge turns as we continued down her
body<00:01:18.730> English<00:01:18.940> had<00:01:19.300> changed<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.900> her<00:01:19.990> terms

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260

were<00:01:20.530> becoming<00:01:20.890> more<00:01:21.100> parallel<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:25.600> times<00:01:25.900> we

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
were becoming more parallel at times we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.330 
were becoming more parallel at times we
would<00:01:26.290> stop<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.890> assess<00:01:27.250> Katie's<00:01:27.730> progress<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
would stop to assess Katie's progress it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.040 
would stop to assess Katie's progress it
is<00:01:33.460> very<00:01:33.700> common<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.300> revert<00:01:34.600> back<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.810> little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
is very common to revert back a little

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.990 
is very common to revert back a little
when<00:01:35.320> skiing<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.830> new<00:01:35.950> hill<00:01:36.220> which<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.670> why<00:01:36.820> it's

when skiing a new hill which is why it's

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.940 
when skiing a new hill which is why it's
so<00:01:37.150> important<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.780> make<00:01:37.930> this<00:01:38.229> gear<00:01:38.500> overly
