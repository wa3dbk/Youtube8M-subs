00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.629
 welcome to the Kracher coffee for all pursuers number three 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.039
 in the aftermath some public which tires does Georg one 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:21.989
 Box has 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.839
 but just has a smooth surface 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.880
 what Apple thought 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.269
 other mice do not have that 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.539
 and 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.670
 this mouse works the other man pushes back and forth 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.820
 and then moved blissfully but in addition she can do much more 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
 and we show you now in the system settings 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.210
 then you go to the apple or it's Saturday solid and minority 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 Bavarian woman is in the dock 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.150
 and then murder 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.470
 then there's the victory and the clique first 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.980
 during the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.470
 you can set this on the right and on the left this is a teaser 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.490
 in normal mice for Windows right-click with the and desktop 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.040
 changed and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960
 all other things too 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.610
 and then, when you click on tasks with this victory and the clique one moves 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.760
 which also information can finish playing it off and so on 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.020
 and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.520
 then we will be happy 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 there you can adjust with trailing or without caster 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.050
 with his pliers professional with caster 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.170
 Everyone actually knows what is meant by scrolling 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.880
 up and down though 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.750
 "There is no failure 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.010
 Then simply stroke a finger over the mouse 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.510
 That's what you do not exactly with just one finger but also some climates 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 for the finger slowly over the mouse surface so 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 we can show it to Moroney even after course 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.760
 I figure out then just run out 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.040
 if you are completely Kreuth 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.740
 Stratmann down and as soon as you stop scrolling the picture stops 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.479
 Thanks, I think super class go beautiful picture zoom 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 You can do that if you have selected a key on the keyboard 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.459
 for example, give it first now so pull on Tel 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.199
 which one here also Dr are the victim 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.649
 when pressed and at the same time with a financial collapse 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.499
 you get closer to the edge of the screen 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 or if you write back again 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.499
 to be back where you were in the beginning 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.129
 this is practical samples to make things stand out 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.640
 or if my little eyesight has you can say that read 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.699
 a Getz still a peculiarity you can also use the mouse with two fingers 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.779
 operate simultaneously 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.699
 this is called navigating through left and right wipe 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.620
 that is, for example, on the Internet quite handy it is by my side 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.719
 go to the next page 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.309
 so thought OK and lose his right 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:09.569
 then you wipe back with two fingers 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.009
 and 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.349
 Years ago wipe again as well as when scrolling your fingers slowly closed 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.049
 convict 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.049
 and then floor until you're back on the right side 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.619
 that was it for the house 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.539
 particularities 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.129
 Magic Mouse 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.349
 now pure 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.309
 Multicard surface 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.309
 and can handle it very easily 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.339
 yes and that was actually it with the 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.929
 Brunswick 8 AktG 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.569
 and we thank you for watching 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.099
 Goodbye
