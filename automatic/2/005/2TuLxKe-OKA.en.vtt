better with the puck so this is

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.619 
better with the puck so this is
something<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.289> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:56.629> menu

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
certain guys need to work on including
myself<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.430> stuff's<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.820> good

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
myself I think that stuff's really good

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
myself I think that stuff's really good
for<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> learn<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:41.100> things

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
for me to learn and just little things

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149 
for me to learn and just little things
like<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.960> mostly<00:01:43.860> moving

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
like that you know that we mostly moving

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
like that you know that we mostly moving
slowly<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:44.820> today<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
slowly out there today just kind of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
slowly out there today just kind of
working<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.079> things<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.619> hands

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
working on little things with your hands

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
working on little things with your hands
and<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.790> footwork<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and a little footwork like that but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
and a little footwork like that but
towards<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> end<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.159> ramped<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.670> little

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
towards the end we ramped it up a little

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
towards the end we ramped it up a little
bit<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.479> think<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> benefit

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
bit and I think that's going to benefit

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.750 
bit and I think that's going to benefit
for

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
for

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.030 
for
best<00:01:55.210> tomorrow<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.270> going<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:57.040> some
