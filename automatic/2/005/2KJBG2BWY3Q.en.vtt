00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to do but anyway so I'm actually curious

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
to do but anyway so I'm actually curious
what<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> came

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
what what would you do if you came

what what would you do if you came
across<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.340> were<00:01:44.790> gonna

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
across these you know you were gonna

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
across these you know you were gonna
sell<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.890> probably<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.470> sell

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
sell them I'm probably going to sell

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.690 
sell them I'm probably going to sell
them<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> they<00:01:50.579> are<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:53.100> knowing<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.549> they're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
them as they are not knowing if they're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.550 
them as they are not knowing if they're
100%<00:01:54.030> completes<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.659> can't<00:01:54.869> open<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.110> bags<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
100% completes I can't open the bags but

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.929 
100% completes I can't open the bags but
I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> bags<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> can

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I think of all the bags are there I can

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.300 
I think of all the bags are there I can
pretty<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.299> figure<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.130> anyway<00:01:59.130> that's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
pretty much figure out but anyway that's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.469 
pretty much figure out but anyway that's
probably<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.820> end<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.060> doing<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
probably what we're end up doing so I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.800 
probably what we're end up doing so I
can<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> most<00:02:01.380> money<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.340> get

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
can get them the most money you can get

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.959 
can get them the most money you can get
anyway<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.799> stack<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.219> can't<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.759> tell

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
anyway the stack you can't really tell

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.029 
anyway the stack you can't really tell
from<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.329> look<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.780> stack<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.770> base

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
