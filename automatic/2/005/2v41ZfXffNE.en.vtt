00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
you want to put the mouth of the puppet
over<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> ear<00:01:47.399> real<00:01:47.970> quick<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
over the ear real quick so that you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
over the ear real quick so that you
don't<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.020> any<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.259> pollen<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.509> silks

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
don't get any other pollen on the silks

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.910 
don't get any other pollen on the silks
so<00:01:52.079> over<00:01:52.680> flip<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> up

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
so over flip it up

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.820 
so over flip it up
you<00:01:55.580> shake<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:56.960> get<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.110> nice<00:01:57.229> Poland<00:01:57.680> cloud

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
you shake so you get a nice Poland cloud

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.100 
you shake so you get a nice Poland cloud
in<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:59.119> really<00:01:59.270> increases<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
in there it really increases the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.399 
in there it really increases the
efficiency<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.520> pollination<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.479> then

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
efficiency of the pollination and then

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.200 
efficiency of the pollination and then
you'll<00:02:03.619> usually<00:02:04.070> at<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.369> end<00:02:04.549> you'll<00:02:04.820> staple

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
you'll usually at the end you'll staple

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.400 
you'll usually at the end you'll staple
the<00:02:05.299> bag<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:06.950> make<00:02:07.100> sure<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.369> stays<00:02:07.580> on

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
the bag on just to make sure it stays on

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.050 
the bag on just to make sure it stays on
most<00:02:09.410> bags<00:02:09.619> are<00:02:09.979> labeled<00:02:10.429> if<00:02:10.550> they're<00:02:10.700> selves

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
most bags are labeled if they're selves

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.170 
most bags are labeled if they're selves
with<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> circle<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.500> square<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.760> later<00:02:13.940> on

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
with a circle and a square so later on

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.309 
with a circle and a square so later on
when<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.660> through<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.959> harvest<00:02:15.230> it

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
when we come through and harvest it

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.840 
when we come through and harvest it
we'll<00:02:15.500> know<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:15.860> self<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.400> itself<00:02:16.700> all

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
we'll know it's a self and itself all

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.670 
we'll know it's a self and itself all
self<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.390> taking<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.750> pollen<00:02:18.080> from<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
self is is taking the pollen from the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.050 
self is is taking the pollen from the
tassel<00:02:19.010> implant<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.489> putting<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.910> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
tassel implant and putting it on the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.770 
tassel implant and putting it on the
silks<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.910> other<00:02:23.000> difference<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.660> we

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
silks and and the other difference is we

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.960 
silks and and the other difference is we
have<00:02:23.810> crosses<00:02:24.349> which<00:02:24.530> which<00:02:24.709> will<00:02:24.890> take<00:02:25.069> from

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
have crosses which which will take from

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.030 
have crosses which which will take from
another<00:02:26.120> plant<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.900> take<00:02:27.080> pollen<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.680> will

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
another plant will take pollen and will

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
another plant will take pollen and will
put<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.250> onto<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.819> silks<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:30.080> plant<00:02:30.350> so

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
put it onto the silks of this plant so

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.650 
put it onto the silks of this plant so
those<00:02:31.160> are<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> two<00:02:31.610> basic<00:02:31.819> pollination<00:02:32.540> is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
those are the two basic pollination is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.140 
those are the two basic pollination is
you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.930> make
