00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.150 
plus it goes well with the theme which
is<00:04:02.570> a<00:04:02.600> natural<00:04:02.810> setting<00:04:03.140> we<00:04:03.590> did<00:04:03.740> want<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.040> keep

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
is a natural setting we did want to keep

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.070 
is a natural setting we did want to keep
it<00:04:04.310> really<00:04:04.430> natural<00:04:04.880> back<00:04:05.030> here<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:05.510> I

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
it really natural back here and I

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.210 
it really natural back here and I
thought<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.380> creek<00:04:06.620> bed<00:04:06.770> would<00:04:06.920> be<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.070> good

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
thought the creek bed would be a good

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.890 
thought the creek bed would be a good
idea<00:04:07.280> just<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.910> meander<00:04:08.510> through<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
idea just to meander through the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.080 
idea just to meander through the
backyard<00:04:09.380> keep<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.220> drainage<00:04:10.640> flowing

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
backyard keep the drainage flowing

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.360 
backyard keep the drainage flowing
continue<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.350> neighbors<00:04:12.680> dry<00:04:13.070> creek

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
continue on to the neighbors dry creek

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.040 
continue on to the neighbors dry creek
bed<00:04:13.400> which<00:04:13.880> they<00:04:14.030> already<00:04:14.180> had<00:04:14.420> Jesse<00:04:15.020> I

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
bed which they already had Jesse I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.510 
bed which they already had Jesse I
really<00:04:15.380> love<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.650> fire<00:04:15.860> pit<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.220> actually

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
really love the fire pit it actually

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520 
really love the fire pit it actually
creates<00:04:16.670> a<00:04:17.030> focal<00:04:17.540> point<00:04:17.570> out<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.320> in<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
creates a focal point out here in the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.110 
creates a focal point out here in the
yard<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.980> probably<00:04:19.520> never<00:04:19.670> had<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:19.970> out

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
yard and probably never had that out

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.729 
yard and probably never had that out
here<00:04:20.299> before<00:04:20.420> but<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:20.900> really<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.350> this<00:04:21.560> if

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
here before but I really like this if

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.960 
here before but I really like this if
it's<00:04:21.890> natural<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.430> definitely<00:04:22.790> looks<00:04:22.910> like

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
it's natural it definitely looks like

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.670 
it's natural it definitely looks like
something<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.390> see<00:04:23.420> the<00:04:23.660> campsite<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.320> think

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
something you see the campsite I think

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.140 
something you see the campsite I think
the<00:04:24.770> trend<00:04:24.950> of<00:04:25.100> landscape<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.670> you<00:04:25.730> see<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.910> lot

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the trend of landscape and you see a lot

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.210 
the trend of landscape and you see a lot
of<00:04:26.180> raised<00:04:26.570> fire<00:04:26.900> pits<00:04:27.200> but<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.800> fits<00:04:28.040> in

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
of raised fire pits but this fits in

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.100 
of raised fire pits but this fits in
well<00:04:28.400> with<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:29.090> natural<00:04:29.360> setting<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.020> was

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
well with the natural setting and it was

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.660 
well with the natural setting and it was
a<00:04:30.170> good<00:04:30.290> selection<00:04:30.560> Paulie<00:04:31.070> how<00:04:31.280> about<00:04:31.520> the
