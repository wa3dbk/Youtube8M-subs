 dignity in the basements or the level zones maybe less pressure instead

 we wanted to dedicate to this space until by month 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.939
 the gym because something that goes beyond the fitness of Rome is more like a 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.989
 something related to

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:48.120
 this 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.149
 the important thing is that structure 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:57.349
 axes 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.290
 returning to their car in the sun 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.439
 general project I believe the mysteries to understand that 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.909
 in general the genius of the lot is very important in this case in this case 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.759
 been even more 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.229

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.870
 % 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:31.979
 my parents who wanted to try as they say a resistance 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.210
 extraordinary 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.430
 doooove 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.500
 star joy of living the structure 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.370
 and the movie of living is capri 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.410
 but the great joy of returning to the hotel in a room of the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.389
 structure with an experience 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.389
 absolutely unforgettable summer crank 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.430
 center I repeat the municipality is very hot 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430
 here I believe it is complete here 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.319
 great traveler who very often a little diverted 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.379
 architecture purchases with meatballs 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.599
 and a little' 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.400
 honors 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.480
 and how this message, which seems very honest to me, takes on 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.259
 very linear. Italian if we want 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.680
 rebecca istituto medi this structure as well as another version that 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.300
 I did oo cuckoo have always been very appreciated for my many 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.120
 connect our very particular work 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.550
 often there is no love among other things they have turned the listen pedin time of 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.440
 jealousy 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.699
 what does one offer? 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.889
 it is something that does not belong to me absolutely because there are so many 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.680
 with her and extraordinary wonderful words 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.839
 and when the opportunity presents itself 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.919
 tomorrow text 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.560
 In this sense, I had the same date in mind 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.039
 of many 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.110
 even my excellent nahe colleagues for singers 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.340
 key key representing another 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.949
 expressions of style 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.210
 but where they are absolutely at ease 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.289
 why 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.289
 because I always say 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.479
 consistency 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.990
 in the things we have to do 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.159
 when a way out 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.520
 alice harmony and coherence 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.680
 lr 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.300
 the project is positive 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.729
 he is unpleasant when 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.339
 we understand that kenny that there is no originality 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.300
 and there is no consistency then it means that there is something that does not work then 

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:48.099
 limitation or elimination of something else 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:58.580
