00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.269
 those who still hesitate to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.139
 to cross the cape of the new

 brains behind the first call of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 duty and their cousins modern warfare 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.239
 titanium crowd should be a fire 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 continuous fireworks supported by the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.840
 microsoft computer servers 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.150
 which will manage some of the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.350
 distance to magnify an achievement 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.350
 already very impressive 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.510
 we are also expecting a lot of cantons 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.220

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 we can also quote fable legends 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.730
 which should not revolutionize his 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.550

 science fiction universe but this 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 time we will go explore the galaxy alone or 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.959
 to many in a hyper experience 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.030
 connected halfway between the game of 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.620
 massively multiplayer role and action 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.620

 pushing the limits of freedom 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050
 of action there is talk of rebellions 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.270
