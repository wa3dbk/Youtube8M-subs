uh<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.210> really<00:02:18.480> lucky<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> think<00:02:19.550> so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
uh you know really lucky I think so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.059 
uh you know really lucky I think so
luckily<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:22.170> been<00:02:22.440> getting<00:02:22.680> premium

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
luckily we have been getting premium

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.400 
luckily we have been getting premium
currency<00:02:23.459> like<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.209> I'm<00:02:24.750> pretty<00:02:25.080> sure<00:02:25.230> if<00:02:25.350> we

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
currency like that I'm pretty sure if we

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.160 
currency like that I'm pretty sure if we
save<00:02:25.740> up<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.340> them<00:02:29.060> especially<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.900> ones

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
save up all of them especially the ones

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.550 
save up all of them especially the ones
from<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> failed<00:02:33.080> Titans<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:36.750> would<00:02:37.020> probably

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
from the failed Titans we would probably

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
from the failed Titans we would probably
be<00:02:37.709> able<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.070> get<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.490> thousand<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.180> even

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
be able to get up to a thousand or even

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.030 
be able to get up to a thousand or even
more<00:02:40.020> depending<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.070> how<00:02:41.190> long<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.550> play
