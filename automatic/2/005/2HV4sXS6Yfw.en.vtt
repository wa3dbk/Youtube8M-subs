00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.400
 here at the toronto here at the largest 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.650
 killerspiel of all times he must 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.640

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.180

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.910
 he knows the great fischer we are going 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.700
 We can counter it 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.030
 sit at the table or we try 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.100
 us at least and I was with the man 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.070
 the Beginning to talk and I once 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550
 one counted here set up here 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.559
 above 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.940
 I want that to be down here 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.589
 There were many down here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.629
 we could take this with us 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.679
 We have space once we have space 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.059
 we have mourn we could do that 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.210
 here with no 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.219
 what are you doing here with him you can do it 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:05.510
 break down here and we were off the whole 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.370
 and take it with us so we have it 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.750
 wrapped 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.950
 we go under it now we mark 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.170
 Let's get away from here about here and now 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 Here we go now 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:23.140
 despite what it wants and I think so 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.430
 are still at the top bobby 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.150
 that may take a while now 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.740
 I make a cut we see each other in good 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.830
 1 1 3 3 2 1 0 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.450
 so as soon you go little back 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010
 here and I want something you 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.130
 less is actually I have fun 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.190
 bought I bought good fun 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.700
 German for small so here we have 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.220
 an all makes fast look 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.710
 As it is called here a TÃ¼rkin box 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.710
 toolbox no a type box so to speak 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.260
 That's for the juniors 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.390
 that's for the forest stage 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.820
 yes we can see how it sounds 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.910
 I sound a little bit now 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.070
 like an old door but it attracts 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.480
 chickens and you can then 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.530
 complete with the pistol easy 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.190
 aim at it and hit it off and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.980
 then you have a nice turkey for 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.250
 fans low so we are still running 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.590
 the eighth 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.230
 hello girls we do not need girls 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.550
 they do not bring us anything because we want to 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.130
 that two have from the deer or 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.730
 similar or whatever was needed yes 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 or the people by bringing out more at 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.870
 the pigs it was something to vulture 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:08.820
 that's just a mouse down there right now 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:10.410
 a mouse that was a mouse or that is 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:20.010
 but crawled out of the ground or 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:25.140
 not what is missing here yes new is yes 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.480
 Also, the geese summed up geese 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.980
 you can now shoot whole ones yes 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.739
 turkey is already winning for fans 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.600
 what is missing here are only a few 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.070
 really that in aasen he hunts that was 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:46.650
 not so customer or something 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:49.170
 that would not be bad yes so i think 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.070
 that could take a while 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.680
 we have traces now but me 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.680
 think that was a girl 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.840
 that would have to be close so much 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:12.359
 sport and we are looking for something fast 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.280
 that was an area that would have to be here 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.120
 have been his eventually 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.530
 I think that's what I asked the female 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.880
 we can call her sometimes or something 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.980
 as we humans just call here 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.980
 through our chick 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.650
 I do not think that brings anything 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.680
 but shit 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.000
 everything sounds to animal's 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.030
 she is there I knew one is 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.169
 girl took sound is the sound forth because 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.080
 The people are a bit up to me 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:54.699
 the same time below the female over 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.860
 until we are in our point just 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.389
 here after a beautiful rain and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.740
 a dive under the trees through 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:06.250
 I discovered a trace 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.270
 she has to be like a girl somewhere 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.490
 be something here 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.449
 I do not know if it is female or 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:18.070
 male is news service 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:27.010
 that's okay, the has been pissed off like that 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:31.240
 a pig so i would so i went 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.830
 a little bit the way it looks 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.770
 it is not bad at all here 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.930
 direction yes everything is nice open many 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.169
 many tracks 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:47.800
 ie we beat our tent here somewhere 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:50.919
 on where it is hidden somewhere but 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:57.820
 well, here we are many again 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:06:02.560
 tracks like her music a book of it 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.240
 trees might stop taking over 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.240
 fewest traces are best 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:13.949
 we are now near the water here 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.710
 I think that's pretty good here 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:20.289
 if we could do it up here 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.849
 Could not back here 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.190
 maybe after 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.190
 Let me build shit tents here 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.930
 is not a question let me but the 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.699
 here counts a joke 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.960
 willste Ramisch up here who's yet 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:44.509
 but great here maybe here or here 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.629
 here is nice flow here 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:55.099
 bribed up here in the middle of the pampa 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:59.689
 okay from me then we'll give it 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:04.939
 watch this here yes I think so 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:08.509
 that you can look good here 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:12.639
 nice stops here and then 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:17.330
 watch what fishermen are carrying around 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:19.059
 jo i think that suits us well 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.039
 the tent here 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:24.639
 that we will hunt here next time 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.639

 Wait a bit for the animals 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.219
