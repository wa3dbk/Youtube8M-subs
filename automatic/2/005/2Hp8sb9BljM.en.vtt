00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
thirteen dollars and some I think the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
thirteen dollars and some I think the
training<00:00:33.719> set<00:00:33.930> which<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.739> twenty-five

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
training set which was like twenty-five

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.540 
training set which was like twenty-five
dollars<00:00:35.640> yeah<00:00:36.059> very<00:00:36.420> expensive<00:00:37.219> but<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> guess

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
dollars yeah very expensive but I guess

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.500 
dollars yeah very expensive but I guess
it's<00:00:38.820> worth<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.809> those<00:00:40.079> sets<00:00:40.829> earlier

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
it's worth it to get those sets earlier
