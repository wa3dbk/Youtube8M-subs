00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.790
 environmental controversy after two months of floods state government announces 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.650
 that goes at least from 12 to 15 the number of pumps that send water from the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.650
 pine and tietê rivers to the billings dam 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:20.570
 has more dirty water to the spring that guarantees the supply of 2 million 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.609
 people 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.990
 the system of floodgates and pumps of treason and 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:27.730
 quarries 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.869
 built in 1940 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 serves to control the floods of the pine and tietê rivers 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.330
 when there is excess water is pumped to the billings dam 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.830
 because of the contamination of the spring 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.020
 the rumors thrown into the rivers 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.510
 the pumping 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.590
 in 1900 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.960
 can only occur in emergency situations 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.550
 such as flood risk 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.420
 which has been repeated several times 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.900
 the government's intention now with the installation of three more bombs 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:00.880
 he is done 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.220
 I loved 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.280
 these bombs we'll see 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.270
 on the connection is there is the sound can move the same amount of water as 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.009
 today caused disorder that the citizen through the overflow of the rivers of 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.009
 a much faster way 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.330
 before it gets to overflow 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.670
 né ii go from the fringes and everything else we go mullet moving this street of 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.780
 so that it does not cause disorder until the prediction is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.460
 that the new pumps will be installed if they start operating 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.720
 in December 2013 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 but environmental experts and responded to the lobster's work 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.370
 the retailer believes that the measure to reduce the floods will increase 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.180
 the dirt of the billings dam 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 it's pollution 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.900
 of the pine rivers 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.259
 being thus haiti until the water used to drink 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.259
 for more than one and a half million people in the metropolitan region 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.940
 the representative of an NGO working in defense of bile 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.799
 says there is already a popular court action to access pumping 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.629
 to increase the system 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.900
 will compromise the quality of the water used in the supply 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.820
 what is not right or not suitable for the population drink a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.589
 cup containing energetic epe 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:24.290
 events is not controlled what is controlled is the occupation of the river 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.839
 farm your riverbank that's what controls to power the water I give myself 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.449
 of the rain to have where to go the problem is that they occupied it is not illegal 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.129
 picture so we already do it already the good was they have more than 10 60 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.899
 years it is done, but in spite of the constitution I heard 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:47.409
 immediately after the date of entry into force of this new 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:53.269
 constitution 18 and has nine is adopted exceptionalities is already 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.789
 discussed 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:03:00.169
 even with with great depth in and these exceptionalities one of them was 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.679
 emergency for flood control
