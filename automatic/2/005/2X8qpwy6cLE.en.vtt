00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.939 
deep flexors of the forearm as you can
see<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> title<00:00:15.089> deep<00:00:15.809> flexors<00:00:16.199> you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
see it on the title deep flexors you

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.980 
see it on the title deep flexors you
have<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.520> also<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.910> superficial<00:00:18.570> group

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
have to have also a superficial group

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.439
