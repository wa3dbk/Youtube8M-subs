00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 Because 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 But speak 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.460
 Sorry 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.390
 I talked about the price cut 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.190
 From the first place of January next year one consecutive 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.140
 But whether it will eventually succeed on the screen 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.760
 It depends on the movement of the user abducted by the appropriate judgment 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.530
 Users are taking their marked marks 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.360
 How can you plant one carefully 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 Must judge 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.460
 Receiving reports from the US side 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.390
 During the season 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 It corresponds to the 2007 fiscal year 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 Use different movements 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.460
 It is a policy to put together what is generally in the midst of making 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 Small and medium layout shoulders 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 In the manner of vendor brushing 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920
 After going through rebuilding 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.540
 Once you move into the back of the screener 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.700
 If you look at it will make it take better now 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
 End 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 1. 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.079
 4-7-9-10 yen from the afternoon four- 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.839
 The order has been confirmed 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.339
 It is not only moving to the fan and expanding the ball 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.349
 I will not be able to get a chance to score 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.540
 Align with your teammates 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.540
 We have to decide together 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.719
 Screenplay Nakagawa absolutely needed 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.059
 Aren't you making it at once? 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.319
 How to understand and practice 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.419
 Listen to the story 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.249
 Is this advanced? 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.259
 Aim to have received the ball and finished 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.679
 It makes sense for the first time 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.879
 Any play 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.119
 To be built on solid basic technology 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 You must decide in your heart 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.249
 Joint 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.430
 I understood 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.430
 this is 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.389
