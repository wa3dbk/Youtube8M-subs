is<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.190> mini<00:02:53.370> foger<00:02:53.760> boost<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.870> might

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
is the mini foger boost and this might

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.250 
is the mini foger boost and this might
be<00:02:55.200> my<00:02:55.320> favorite<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> whole<00:02:55.950> group

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260

be my favorite of the whole group
deceptively<00:02:58.260> simple<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.730> lot

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
deceptively simple but there's a lot

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.520 
deceptively simple but there's a lot
going<00:03:00.270> on<00:03:00.390> under<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> hood<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.140> most<00:03:01.380> of

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
going on under the hood like most of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.030 
going on under the hood like most of
these<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.400> three<00:03:03.240> controls<00:03:03.630> game<00:03:04.050> tone<00:03:04.500> level

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
these but three controls game tone level

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.070 
these but three controls game tone level
and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.300> two-way<00:03:06.600> switch

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
and then you have a two-way switch

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.620 
and then you have a two-way switch
labeled<00:03:07.800> boost<00:03:08.280> where<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.420> two

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
labeled boost where you have kind of two

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.990 
labeled boost where you have kind of two
different<00:03:09.660> boosts<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:11.280> way<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.580> hear<00:03:11.940> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
different boosts the way that I hear it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.460 
different boosts the way that I hear it
as<00:03:12.120> I'm<00:03:12.330> playing<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.750> when<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.960> get<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> boost

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
as I'm playing it when you get the boost

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.080 
as I'm playing it when you get the boost
in<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> down<00:03:13.890> switch<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.490> more<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.820> clean

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
in the down switch it's more of a clean

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.710 
in the down switch it's more of a clean
boost<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:16.460> sounds<00:03:17.460> great<00:03:17.790> if<00:03:18.030> you've<00:03:18.210> got<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
boost it sounds great if you've got the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.690 
boost it sounds great if you've got the
level<00:03:19.080> kind<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.590> dimed<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.550> way

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
level kind of just dimed out all the way

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.660 
level kind of just dimed out all the way
and<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.260> gain<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.770> basically<00:03:23.100> add

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and then the gain you can basically add

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.470 
and then the gain you can basically add
a<00:03:24.140> little<00:03:25.140> bit<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.530> bite<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.850> know<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.330> end

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
a little bit of bite you know on the end

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480 
a little bit of bite you know on the end
of<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.660> notes<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.230> that's<00:03:28.800> all<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.220> way<00:03:29.310> up

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
of the notes and that's all the way up

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.310 
of the notes and that's all the way up
or<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.060> dial<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.420> back<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.050> still

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
or you can dial it back and you still

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.990 
or you can dial it back and you still
get<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> clean<00:03:31.890> boost<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.310> not<00:03:32.460> any<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
get the clean boost with not any of the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390 
get the clean boost with not any of the
bite<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.780> set<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.200> tone<00:03:34.470> where<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.860> want<00:03:35.070> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
bite you set the tone where you want and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
bite you set the tone where you want and
the<00:03:35.700> cool<00:03:35.910> thing<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.660> use<00:03:36.780> expression

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the cool thing is you can use expression

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.210 
the cool thing is you can use expression
pedal<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.550> basically<00:03:39.140> uses

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
pedal and with this it basically uses

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.310 
pedal and with this it basically uses
wherever<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.490> gain<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.940> set<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.990> start

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
wherever the gain is set as the start

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960 
wherever the gain is set as the start
point<00:03:43.620> for<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:44.010> sweep<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> your<00:03:44.550> expression

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
point for the sweep of your expression

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.610 
point for the sweep of your expression
pedal<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.540> volume<00:03:45.900> pedal<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.410> way

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
pedal and it's a volume pedal the way

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.680 
pedal and it's a volume pedal the way
that<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.980> boosts<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.670> enhances<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.210> tone<00:03:48.510> it

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that it boosts and enhances your tone it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.880 
that it boosts and enhances your tone it
sounds<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.200> good<00:03:49.410> you're<00:03:49.560> never<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:49.860> to

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
sounds so good you're never going to

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.470 
sounds so good you're never going to
want<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.160> turn<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.490> off<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:51.090> could<00:03:51.209> leave<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
want to turn it off you could leave it

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.960 
want to turn it off you could leave it
on<00:03:51.630> all<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.020> time<00:03:52.050> as<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.740> clean<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.880> know

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
on all the time as like a clean you know

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.820 
on all the time as like a clean you know
bump<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.510> preamp<00:03:55.020> just<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.410> live<00:03:55.620> in

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
bump like preamp just to live in

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.590 
bump like preamp just to live in
everything<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.250> your<00:03:56.340> signal<00:03:56.730> up<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.120> then

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
everything in your signal up and then

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.750 
everything in your signal up and then
have<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.320> expression<00:03:59.100> pedal<00:03:59.130> in<00:03:59.490> all<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
have the expression pedal in all the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.580 
have the expression pedal in all the
time<00:03:59.940> basically<00:04:00.420> you'll<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> you've<00:04:01.440> got

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
time basically you'll have a you've got

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.530 
time basically you'll have a you've got
a<00:04:01.620> built<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.430> volume<00:04:02.580> pedal<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.180> your<00:04:03.330> board

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
a built in volume pedal on your board

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.300 
a built in volume pedal on your board
without<00:04:03.810> having<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.170> actually<00:04:04.320> go<00:04:04.530> by<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.280> a

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
without having to actually go by like a

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.949 
without having to actually go by like a
volume<00:04:05.610> pedal<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.120> run<00:04:06.270> extra<00:04:06.600> cable<00:04:06.870> and

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
volume pedal and run extra cable and

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.370 
volume pedal and run extra cable and
stuff<00:04:07.910> but<00:04:08.910> yeah<00:04:09.090> incredible<00:04:09.780> as<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.990> clean

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
stuff but yeah incredible as a clean

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.949 
stuff but yeah incredible as a clean
boost<00:04:10.620> super<00:04:11.280> musical<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.030> adds<00:04:12.270> this<00:04:12.690> kind

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
boost super musical just adds this kind

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.449 
boost super musical just adds this kind
of<00:04:13.020> like<00:04:13.110> weird<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:13.709> rich<00:04:13.950> harmonic

dirty<00:04:18.750> when<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.500> play<00:04:19.680> their<00:04:19.859> dirty<00:04:20.010> amp<00:04:20.250> it's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
dirty when you play their dirty amp it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.730 
dirty when you play their dirty amp it's
not<00:04:20.520> as<00:04:20.670> dramatic<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.690> bump<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.170> as

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
not as dramatic of a bump and as

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.560 
not as dramatic of a bump and as
noticeable<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:23.880> you're<00:04:24.000> playing<00:04:24.210> clean

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
noticeable as when you're playing clean

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.270 
noticeable as when you're playing clean
but<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.140> does<00:04:25.320> add<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.590> little<00:04:25.740> bit<00:04:25.980> of<00:04:26.070> richness

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
but it does add a little bit of richness

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.050 
but it does add a little bit of richness
and<00:04:26.730> thickness<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.330> everything<00:04:29.030> then<00:04:30.030> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
and thickness to everything then you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.730 
and thickness to everything then you
switch<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.570> boost<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.020> up<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.500> that's

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
switch the boost to the up and that's

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.590 
switch the boost to the up and that's
where<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.280> gain<00:04:32.460> control<00:04:32.669> actually<00:04:33.330> comes

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
where the gain control actually comes

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.950 
where the gain control actually comes
into<00:04:34.020> play<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.540> doesn't<00:04:36.540> have<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.690> ton

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960

of<00:04:36.990> gain<00:04:37.260> on<00:04:37.440> tap<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.100> got<00:04:38.220> enough<00:04:38.550> to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
of gain on tap but it's got enough to

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.800 
of gain on tap but it's got enough to
get<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> very<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.810> beautiful<00:04:40.440> open<00:04:40.890> chime<00:04:41.250> e

overdrive when you're playing through a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.440

a dirty amp it isn't totally incredible

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.240 
a dirty amp it isn't totally incredible
boost<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.540> great<00:04:48.960> great<00:04:48.990> lead<00:04:49.530> boost<00:04:49.830> super

boost like great great lead boost super

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.800 
boost like great great lead boost super
musical<00:04:50.700> sounds<00:04:51.000> great<00:04:51.150> with<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.330> neck<00:04:51.570> pickup

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
musical sounds great with a neck pickup

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.630 
musical sounds great with a neck pickup
sounds<00:04:52.440> great<00:04:52.560> with<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.830> bridge<00:04:53.040> pickup<00:04:53.070> and

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
sounds great with the bridge pickup and

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.340 
sounds great with the bridge pickup and
then<00:04:53.880> again<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.390> expression<00:04:54.870> pedal<00:04:55.169> works

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
then again the expression pedal works

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.620 
then again the expression pedal works
the<00:04:55.530> same<00:04:55.740> way<00:04:55.979> in<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.580> mode<00:04:56.820> what<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.390> cool

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the same way in that mode what a cool

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.800 
the same way in that mode what a cool
thing<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.229> can

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
thing is you can

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.290 
thing is you can
going<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.990> set<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.410> gain<00:04:59.650> I<00:05:00.100> don't<00:05:00.970> know<00:05:01.060> like

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
going to set the gain I don't know like

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.470 
going to set the gain I don't know like
at<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.870> third<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:03.220> ten<00:05:03.430> o'clock<00:05:03.580> or<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.210> and

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
at a third like ten o'clock or so and

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.030 
at a third like ten o'clock or so and
that's<00:05:04.930> again<00:05:05.200> that's<00:05:05.290> where<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.590> sweep<00:05:05.830> will

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
that's again that's where the sweep will

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.230 
that's again that's where the sweep will
start<00:05:06.340> so<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.610> can<00:05:06.700> have<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.850> level<00:05:07.120> all<00:05:07.210> the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
start so you can have the level all the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
start so you can have the level all the
way<00:05:07.330> up<00:05:07.389> where<00:05:07.630> you're<00:05:07.720> still<00:05:07.900> getting<00:05:08.050> the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
way up where you're still getting the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.320 
way up where you're still getting the
boost<00:05:08.530> but<00:05:09.220> then<00:05:09.370> when<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.669> actually<00:05:09.820> rock

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
boost but then when you actually rock

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.420 
boost but then when you actually rock
the<00:05:10.810> expression<00:05:11.260> pedal<00:05:11.560> forward<00:05:11.830> you'll<00:05:12.310> just

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
the expression pedal forward you'll just

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.430 
the expression pedal forward you'll just
be<00:05:12.550> bringing<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.120> all<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:13.660> extra<00:05:13.990> gain<00:05:14.260> so

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
be bringing in all that extra gain so

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.810 
be bringing in all that extra gain so
you<00:05:14.500> can<00:05:14.590> actually<00:05:14.860> use<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.550> know<00:05:15.610> for

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
you can actually use it you know for

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.520 
you can actually use it you know for
like<00:05:15.940> leads<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.419> stuff<00:05:16.510> playing<00:05:17.230> something

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
like leads and stuff playing something

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.620 
like leads and stuff playing something
like<00:05:17.650> slightly<00:05:17.980> clean<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.700> then<00:05:19.270> just

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
like slightly clean and then just

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.290 
like slightly clean and then just
bringing<00:05:20.139> in<00:05:20.290> gain<00:05:20.620> gradually<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:22.000> where

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
bringing in gain gradually to where

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.540 
bringing in gain gradually to where
you're<00:05:22.450> in<00:05:22.480> like<00:05:22.690> totally<00:05:23.340> oversaturated<00:05:24.340> you

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
you're in like totally oversaturated you

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.250 
you're in like totally oversaturated you
know<00:05:24.610> searing<00:05:25.180> lead<00:05:25.690> tone<00:05:26.940> area<00:05:27.940> so<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.480> very

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
know searing lead tone area so a very

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.860 
know searing lead tone area so a very
very<00:05:29.530> cool<00:05:29.910> pedal<00:05:30.910> one<00:05:31.300> of<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.479> most

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
very cool pedal one of the most

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.300 
very cool pedal one of the most
interesting<00:05:32.200> boost<00:05:32.560> pedals<00:05:32.889> ever<00:05:33.010> played
