unbelievable<00:05:47.260> saw<00:05:47.410> some<00:05:47.530> like<00:05:47.650> 92<00:05:48.010> finishing

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.370 
unbelievable saw some like 92 finishing
and<00:05:48.760> he's<00:05:49.210> just<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.390> fantastic<00:05:49.720> player<00:05:50.050> to<00:05:50.170> use

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
and he's just a fantastic player to use

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.200 
and he's just a fantastic player to use
I<00:05:50.590> heard<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:50.920> he<00:05:51.070> enjoyed<00:05:51.370> them<00:05:51.520> as<00:05:51.580> well<00:05:51.760> so

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
I heard that he enjoyed them as well so

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.910 
I heard that he enjoyed them as well so
that's<00:05:52.330> my<00:05:52.960> opinion<00:05:53.170> and<00:05:53.350> team<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.560> think<00:05:53.680> is<00:05:53.860> a

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
that's my opinion and team I think is a

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.260 
that's my opinion and team I think is a
very<00:05:53.950> very<00:05:54.250> solid<00:05:54.550> team<00:05:54.700> is<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.060> two

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
very very solid team is the two

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.490 
very very solid team is the two
centre-backs<00:05:55.510> as<00:05:55.720> well<00:05:55.870> very<00:05:56.050> good<00:05:56.170> as<00:05:56.350> well

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
centre-backs as well very good as well

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.320 
centre-backs as well very good as well
so<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.220> can't<00:05:57.460> really<00:05:57.550> fault<00:05:57.820> him<00:05:57.970> too<00:05:58.150> much

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
so I can't really fault him too much

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.030 
so I can't really fault him too much
obviously<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.140> left-back<00:05:59.500> being<00:05:59.740> that<00:05:59.920> the

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
obviously the left-back being that the

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.770 
obviously the left-back being that the
chemistry<00:06:00.490> might<00:06:00.760> be<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> bit<00:06:01.210> of<00:06:01.300> a<00:06:01.330> shame<00:06:01.510> but

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
chemistry might be a bit of a shame but

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.440 
chemistry might be a bit of a shame but
apart<00:06:02.440> from<00:06:02.470> that<00:06:02.590> very<00:06:03.100> good<00:06:03.190> team<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.550> I

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
apart from that very good team and I

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.870 
apart from that very good team and I
still<00:06:04.960> think<00:06:05.140> mine's<00:06:05.290> a<00:06:05.380> lot<00:06:05.500> better<00:06:08.820> but<00:06:09.820> I

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
still think mine's a lot better but I

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.670 
still think mine's a lot better but I
Frank<00:06:10.210> for<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:10.420> Howie<00:06:10.660> so<00:06:11.080> here<00:06:11.530> I've

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680

gameplay<00:06:35.539> isn't<00:06:35.840> too<00:06:36.020> laggy<00:06:36.259> I've<00:06:36.530> struggled

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
gameplay isn't too laggy I've struggled

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.010 
gameplay isn't too laggy I've struggled
a<00:06:37.069> lot<00:06:37.280> to<00:06:37.490> try<00:06:37.699> and<00:06:37.819> make<00:06:37.940> good<00:06:38.120> gameplay<00:06:38.539> and

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
a lot to try and make good gameplay and

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.779 
a lot to try and make good gameplay and
without<00:06:39.349> a<00:06:39.409> lag<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.710> too<00:06:40.009> much<00:06:40.220> so<00:06:40.460> hopefully

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
without a lag in too much so hopefully

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.119 
without a lag in too much so hopefully
it's<00:06:40.879> not<00:06:40.970> too<00:06:41.030> laggy<00:06:41.360> hopefully<00:06:42.289> it's<00:06:42.470> okay

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.129 
it's not too laggy hopefully it's okay

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.589 
it's not too laggy hopefully it's okay
to<00:06:43.190> watch<00:06:43.520> I<00:06:43.759> think<00:06:43.940> it<00:06:44.030> looks<00:06:44.210> like<00:06:44.360> so

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599
