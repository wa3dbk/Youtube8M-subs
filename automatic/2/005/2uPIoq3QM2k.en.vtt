00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to 11 i'm going to go one two again so i

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
to 11 i'm going to go one two again so i
could<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.230> sign<00:00:43.410> language<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:43.980> up<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> 20

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
could use sign language to go up to 20

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.690 
could use sign language to go up to 20
and<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.890> confusing<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.550> way

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
