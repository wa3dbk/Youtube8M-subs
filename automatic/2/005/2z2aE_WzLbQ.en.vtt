you went around the depth chart and kind

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.490 
you went around the depth chart and kind
of<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.489> guess<00:00:51.000> excuse<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:51.899> could<00:00:52.110> say<00:00:52.170> lost

of go I guess excuse me could say lost

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
of go I guess excuse me could say lost
in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> shuffle<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.309> mean<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.480> came<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
in the shuffle I mean he came with the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.490 
in the shuffle I mean he came with the
situation<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.020> coaching<00:00:58.020> staff<00:00:58.050> come

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
situation with the coaching staff come

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.010 
situation with the coaching staff come
in<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.309> he<00:00:59.370> was<00:01:00.020> obviously

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
in and kind of how he was obviously

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
in and kind of how he was obviously
suspended<00:01:01.590> i<00:01:01.649> guess<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:01.949> two<00:01:02.129> rules<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
suspended i guess for two rules you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
suspended i guess for two rules you
think<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> played<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> background<00:01:04.320> most

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
think that played a background most

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.190 
think that played a background most
definitely<00:01:05.339> yeah<00:01:05.659> when<00:01:06.659> he<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.049> got

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
definitely yeah when he got when he got

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600 
definitely yeah when he got when he got
here<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.799> coaches<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.460> he

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
here when I can do coaches got here he

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.510 
here when I can do coaches got here he
had<00:01:09.150> some<00:01:09.390> distant<00:01:09.750> discipline<00:01:10.170> area<00:01:10.520> stuff

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
had some distant discipline area stuff

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
had some distant discipline area stuff
gone<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.090> him<00:01:12.240> i'm<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.320> happened

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
gone with him i'm not sure what happened

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
gone with him i'm not sure what happened
exactly<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:15.210> happened<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> guess<00:01:16.020> he

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
exactly but it happened and I guess he

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.450 
exactly but it happened and I guess he
felt<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.650> maybe<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:19.170> wouldn't<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
felt like maybe what he wouldn't on a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.530 
felt like maybe what he wouldn't on a
good<00:01:20.640> side<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> coaches<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:23.450> guess<00:01:24.450> he

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
good side with the coaches so I guess he

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
good side with the coaches so I guess he
saw<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> opportunity<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> decided<00:01:25.740> to
