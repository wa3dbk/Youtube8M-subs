00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:07.709 
so the forest and natural resource

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.579 
so the forest and natural resource
management<00:00:08.429> major<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.509> really<00:00:09.990> designed<00:00:10.139> to

working in forested ecosystems whether

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.730 
working in forested ecosystems whether
they're<00:00:15.809> managed<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:17.130> timber<00:00:17.790> production

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
they're managed for timber production

they're managed for timber production
whether<00:00:19.740> they're<00:00:20.010> managed<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.790> the

whether they occur in our urban systems

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.979 
whether they occur in our urban systems
my<00:00:32.519> favorite<00:00:32.910> part<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> program<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.750> think

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
my favorite part of the program I think

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
my favorite part of the program I think
is<00:00:34.289> the<00:00:34.440> small<00:00:34.890> community<00:00:35.879> feel<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.420> really

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is the small community feel we really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.239 
is the small community feel we really
get<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.109> our<00:00:37.199> professors<00:00:37.350> really<00:00:38.039> well

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:38.249 
get to know our professors really well

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.160 
get to know our professors really well
our<00:00:38.609> department<00:00:39.149> head<00:00:39.269> almost<00:00:39.420> knows<00:00:39.749> all<00:00:39.989> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
leave I decided on this major because I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
leave I decided on this major because I
wanted<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> work<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.150> field

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
wanted to work in a field

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
wanted to work in a field
someday<00:01:16.620> that<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:16.920> work<00:01:17.160> with<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.640> people

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
someday that would work with how people

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
someday that would work with how people
in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> environment<00:01:18.930> interact<00:01:19.410> so<00:01:20.040> really

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
in the environment interact so really

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.540 
in the environment interact so really
focusing<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.960> science<00:01:22.410> aspects<00:01:23.010> of<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
focusing on the science aspects of the

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.340 
focusing on the science aspects of the
environment<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.390> learning<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:24.960> how

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
environment really learning about how

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870 
environment really learning about how
the<00:01:25.380> environment<00:01:25.740> functions<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.670> well<00:01:26.820> as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the environment functions as well as

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.180 
the environment functions as well as
trees<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.630> also<00:01:28.320> working<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.770> people

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
trees and then also working with people

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.730 
trees and then also working with people
and<00:01:29.700> understanding<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:31.080> interact<00:01:31.620> with

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and understanding how they interact with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.290 
and understanding how they interact with
the<00:01:31.950> environment<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.760> fuel<00:01:32.940> sessions

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the environment and the fuel sessions

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.850 
the environment and the fuel sessions
are<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.540> hands-on<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.410> to<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
are really hands-on you get to use a lot

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.040 
are really hands-on you get to use a lot
of<00:01:35.070> tools<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.300> would<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.570> using<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
of tools that you would be using as a

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.530 
of tools that you would be using as a
professional<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.490> good<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> learn

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
professional so it's a good way to learn

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.880 
professional so it's a good way to learn
about<00:01:40.050> what<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.710> doing

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
about what are your going to be doing

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
about what are your going to be doing
and<00:01:41.160> practice<00:01:41.700> those<00:01:41.850> skills<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.750> when

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and practice those skills you know when

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.360 
and practice those skills you know when
you're<00:01:43.170> sitting<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.650> classroom<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.280> you're

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
you're sitting in a classroom and you're

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.370 
you're sitting in a classroom and you're

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
looking at pictures projected up on a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.680 
looking at pictures projected up on a
wall<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:47.160> you're<00:01:47.310> hearing<00:01:47.880> someone<00:01:48.330> talk

about<00:01:48.720> some<00:01:49.410> concept<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.640> quite<00:01:51.120> the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
about some concept it's not quite the
