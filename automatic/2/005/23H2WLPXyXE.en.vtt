the iPhone 5s you can see this is a
little<00:01:07.409> bit<00:01:07.590> bigger<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:09.360> iPhone<00:01:10.049> 6<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> did

little bit bigger now the iPhone 6 I did

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.719 
little bit bigger now the iPhone 6 I did
have<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> chance<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.250> play<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> little

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have a chance to play with it a little

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
have a chance to play with it a little
bit<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.049> bigger<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.650> give

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bit it is a little bit bigger to give

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
bit it is a little bit bigger to give
you<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> size<00:01:14.250> comparison<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.750> put<00:01:16.080> these

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you a size comparison if I put these

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
you a size comparison if I put these
together<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:19.170> even

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
together it's probably out to not even

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
together it's probably out to not even
as<00:01:19.560> big<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> whole<00:01:20.250> black<00:01:20.549> screen<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.360> it's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
as big as the whole black screen so it's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
as big as the whole black screen so it's
it's<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.860> size<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:23.970> that's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it's a really good size now that's

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's a really good size now that's
pretty<00:01:24.780> big<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.500> let<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.770> show<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> other

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
pretty big but let me show you other

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
pretty big but let me show you other
large<00:01:26.909> phones<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> give<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.689> idea<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.170> this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
large phones to give you an idea so this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.390 
large phones to give you an idea so this
is<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> 4.7<00:01:29.220> inch<00:01:29.460> display<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> moto<00:01:30.990> X

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
is a 4.7 inch display this is a moto X

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
is a 4.7 inch display this is a moto X
so<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.579> gives<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.000> idea<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.450> more

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so this gives you an idea this is more

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.700 
so this gives you an idea this is more
along<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> size<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.640> iPhone<00:01:35.759> 6<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
along the size of the iPhone 6 and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.999 
along the size of the iPhone 6 and then
moving<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.369> we'll<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.840> Galaxy<00:01:40.770> Note<00:01:40.979> 3

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
moving up we'll go to the Galaxy Note 3

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.399 
moving up we'll go to the Galaxy Note 3
so<00:01:41.759> let's<00:01:41.970> put<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.329> side-by-side<00:01:42.659> move

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
so let's put this side-by-side move

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.719 
so let's put this side-by-side move
these<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.180> Galaxy<00:01:45.180> Note<00:01:45.329> 3<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
these out of the way Galaxy Note 3 and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.539 
these out of the way Galaxy Note 3 and
then<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.909> oneplus<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> get<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> good

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
then the oneplus one so you get a good

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
then the oneplus one so you get a good
idea<00:01:50.729> how<00:01:51.000> big<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.630> phone<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> now

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
idea how big this phone really is now

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.100 
idea how big this phone really is now
the<00:01:52.710> iPhone<00:01:52.890> 6<00:01:53.520> plus<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:54.030> thinner<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the iPhone 6 plus is thinner than all of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.999 
the iPhone 6 plus is thinner than all of
these<00:01:55.259> phones<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.820> sticks<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.329> actually

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
these phones and this sticks up actually

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.389 
these phones and this sticks up actually
the<00:01:59.009> iPhone<00:01:59.549> 6<00:02:00.060> plus<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:01.049> much<00:02:01.710> thinner<00:02:02.040> than

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the iPhone 6 plus is much thinner than

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.580 
the iPhone 6 plus is much thinner than
the<00:02:02.520> Galaxy<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.869> look<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> side

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the Galaxy now if you look on the side

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.960 
the Galaxy now if you look on the side
here<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:07.560> significantly<00:02:08.220> thinner<00:02:08.459> instead

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
here it's significantly thinner instead

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.580 
here it's significantly thinner instead
of<00:02:09.090> having<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.479> back<00:02:09.780> piece<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.319> actually

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of having this back piece it's actually

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.410 
of having this back piece it's actually
about<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> size<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
about the size of the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.750 
about the size of the
plastic<00:02:12.750> sidepiece<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.650> then<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.250> compare<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
plastic sidepiece and then to compare it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.130 
plastic sidepiece and then to compare it
with<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.090> 1+1<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.140> different

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
with the 1+1 you can see different

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.530 
with the 1+1 you can see different
profiles<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.250> 1+1<00:02:20.849> isn't<00:02:21.239> too<00:02:21.390> much

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
profiles but the 1+1 isn't too much

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.839 
profiles but the 1+1 isn't too much
thicker<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.349> thicker<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.489> see<00:02:23.760> it

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
thicker but it is thicker you can see it

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.010 
thicker but it is thicker you can see it
better<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.120> top<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> pretty<00:02:27.750> large

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
better on top so this is a pretty large

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720 
better on top so this is a pretty large
phone<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:29.040> those<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.520> like

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
phone and for those of you that like

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.790 
phone and for those of you that like
large<00:02:30.000> phones<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> problem<00:02:31.140> but

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
large phones that's not a problem but

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800 
large phones that's not a problem but
for<00:02:32.010> some<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.209> be<00:02:33.360> way

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
for some of you this is going to be way

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290 
for some of you this is going to be way
too<00:02:33.870> large<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.430> when<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.819> add<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> case

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
too large and then when you add a case

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.180 
too large and then when you add a case
on<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.930> gets<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> little<00:02:37.530> bit<00:02:37.830> bigger<00:02:38.069> so

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
on to it it gets a little bit bigger so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
on to it it gets a little bit bigger so
I've<00:02:38.489> been<00:02:38.670> using<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.319> iPhone<00:02:40.319> 5<00:02:40.620> leather

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
I've been using the iPhone 5 leather

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.900 
I've been using the iPhone 5 leather
case<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.000> we<00:02:42.150> pop<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.630> on<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
case and if we pop this on here this is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.880 
case and if we pop this on here this is
how<00:02:45.030> most<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.900> probably<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.739> to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
how most of you are probably going to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.050 
how most of you are probably going to
use<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.880> iPhone<00:02:48.350> you'll<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.430> you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
use the iPhone you'll see this is you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.520 
use the iPhone you'll see this is you
kind<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.269> just<00:02:51.510> slide<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> into<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.290> top<00:02:52.500> of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
kind of just slide it into the top of

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.330 
kind of just slide it into the top of
the<00:02:52.739> case<00:02:52.920> almost<00:02:53.720> there<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.840> go<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.500> you'll

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
the case almost there we go and you'll

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.490 
the case almost there we go and you'll
see<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> good<00:02:57.239> sized<00:02:57.720> case<00:02:58.170> it's

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
see this is a good sized case it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.509 
see this is a good sized case it's
really<00:02:59.250> large<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.940> adds<00:03:00.360> very<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.709> as<00:03:02.220> far

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
really large and adds very little as far

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.090 
really large and adds very little as far
as<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.910> thickness<00:03:03.239> as<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:03.870> see<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.440> but

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
as the thickness as you can see here but

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.970 
as the thickness as you can see here but
it<00:03:06.090> does<00:03:06.299> make<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> much<00:03:06.930> bigger<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.709> if

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
it does make it that much bigger so if

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.120 
it does make it that much bigger so if
you're<00:03:08.220> going<00:03:08.549> from<00:03:08.760> an<00:03:08.880> iPhone<00:03:09.299> 5<00:03:10.130> obviously

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
you're going from an iPhone 5 obviously

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.979 
you're going from an iPhone 5 obviously
you're<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.850> significant<00:03:12.630> size

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
you're going to have a significant size

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.320 
you're going to have a significant size
difference<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.519> have<00:03:14.610> large<00:03:14.819> hands<00:03:15.239> so

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
difference and I have large hands so

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.490 
difference and I have large hands so
that's<00:03:15.510> why<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.660> wanted<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.900> show<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
that's why I wanted to show you like I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.009 
that's why I wanted to show you like I
said<00:03:16.680> before<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.700> difference<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.720> just

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
said before the difference this is just

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.170 
said before the difference this is just
a<00:03:19.260> massive<00:03:19.620> phone<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:20.489> slightly<00:03:20.790> taller

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
a massive phone it's slightly taller

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.990 
a massive phone it's slightly taller
than<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.959> Galaxy<00:03:22.380> Note<00:03:22.560> 3<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.190> slightly

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
than a Galaxy Note 3 but slightly

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.300 
than a Galaxy Note 3 but slightly
narrower<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.109> that's<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.410> good<00:03:25.590> size<00:03:25.829> idea<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
narrower so that's a good size idea I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.340 
narrower so that's a good size idea I
hope<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.880> maybe<00:03:27.090> it'll<00:03:27.299> give<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> good

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
hope and maybe it'll give you a good

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.750 
hope and maybe it'll give you a good
idea<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.650> how<00:03:28.709> big<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.430> those<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.579> you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
idea of how big it is for those of you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.590 
idea of how big it is for those of you
that<00:03:29.910> don't<00:03:30.090> have<00:03:30.209> phones<00:03:30.630> yet<00:03:31.040> maybe

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
that don't have phones yet maybe

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.910 
that don't have phones yet maybe
something<00:03:33.600> along<00:03:33.750> lines<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.350> an<00:03:34.470> Apple<00:03:34.799> Mouse

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
something along lines of an Apple Mouse

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.569 
something along lines of an Apple Mouse
might<00:03:35.250> be<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> good<00:03:35.640> good<00:03:36.150> size<00:03:36.390> comparison<00:03:37.579> you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
might be a good good size comparison you

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.050 
might be a good good size comparison you
can<00:03:38.640> see<00:03:39.200> good<00:03:40.200> size<00:03:40.470> there<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
can see good size there it is just a

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.970 
can see good size there it is just a
massive<00:03:42.359> phone<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.350> really<00:03:43.530> meant<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.890> be

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
massive phone so it's really meant to be

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.190 
massive phone so it's really meant to be
used<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.400> hand<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:44.850> think<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.049> can

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
used to hand that I think and you can

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
used to hand that I think and you can
see<00:03:46.380> they've<00:03:46.530> changed<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:47.070> layout<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.030> little

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
see they've changed the layout a little

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.120 
see they've changed the layout a little
bit<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.780> when<00:03:48.989> you're<00:03:49.200> rotated<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> landscape

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
