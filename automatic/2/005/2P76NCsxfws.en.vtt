quick<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.839> different<00:00:16.400> inflators<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
quick the two different inflators that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.500 
quick the two different inflators that
you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:17.970> from<00:00:18.480> tire<00:00:19.289> balls<00:00:19.619> themselves

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
you can get from tire balls themselves

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.939 
you can get from tire balls themselves
the<00:00:21.510> original<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.410> came<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the original one that came out with a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.620 
the original one that came out with a
long<00:00:23.189> time<00:00:23.609> ago<00:00:23.760> back<00:00:24.029> when<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.269> first<00:00:24.480> came

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
long time ago back when they first came

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.689 
long time ago back when they first came
out<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> single<00:00:25.670> inflator<00:00:27.140> work<00:00:28.140> great

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
out it was a single inflator work great

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.170 
out it was a single inflator work great
still<00:00:29.699> does<00:00:30.470> but<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.550> takes<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> little

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
still does but it just it takes a little

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.639 
still does but it just it takes a little
bit<00:00:33.530> too<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.739> time<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.640> me<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.050> i<00:00:37.050> really

bit too much time for me I i really
enjoy<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.820> multi-port<00:00:39.559> inflator<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.860> not

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
enjoy the the multi-port inflator or not

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to go tire ball the tire ball all the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
to go tire ball the tire ball all the
way<00:00:52.620> around<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.800> half<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
way around and doing you know a half a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.540 
way around and doing you know a half a
half<00:00:57.570> pound<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> half<00:00:58.620> pound<00:00:58.890> again<00:00:59.250> half

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
pound again just keep stepping yourself

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
pound again just keep stepping yourself
up<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.760> around<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
up as you go around as you go around you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
up as you go around as you go around you
make<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.010> full<00:01:05.220> complete<00:01:05.700> circle<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.810> you're

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
make one full complete circle and you're

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.950 
make one full complete circle and you're
back<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.010> ball<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> started<00:01:09.119> go

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
back to your the ball you started go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
back to your the ball you started go
counter<00:01:10.470> clockwise<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.180> clockwise<00:01:12.180> then

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
counter clockwise then clockwise then

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.030 
counter clockwise then clockwise then
cut<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.470> keep<00:01:13.650> reversing<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.450> until

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
cut and just keep reversing that until

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.810 
cut and just keep reversing that until
every<00:01:17.040> ball<00:01:17.250> has<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:18.979> desired<00:01:19.979> air<00:01:20.369> pressure

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
every ball has your desired air pressure

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.420 
every ball has your desired air pressure
in<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.990> air<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.680> tire<00:01:22.950> ball<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
in it if you just air one tire ball at a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
in it if you just air one tire ball at a
time<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.180> pressure<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
time to your pressure by the time you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
time to your pressure by the time you
get<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.009> last<00:01:26.280> tire<00:01:26.939> ball<00:01:27.270> yeah

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
get to your very last tire ball yeah

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
get to your very last tire ball yeah
you'll<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> aired<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.189> pressure

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you'll get it aired up to your pressure

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
you'll get it aired up to your pressure
that<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:31.140> all<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.740> balls<00:01:31.950> will<00:01:32.340> now

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that you want but all the balls will now

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.719 
that you want but all the balls will now
have<00:01:32.869> different<00:01:33.869> volumes<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.950> air<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.340> them<00:01:35.460> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have different volumes of air in them so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.050 
have different volumes of air in them so
say<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> blew<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:38.100> right<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> racing

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
say you blew your right and racing

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
say you blew your right and racing
whatever<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> pop<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.500> tire<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
whatever and you pop your tire and the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
whatever and you pop your tire and the
stick<00:01:41.820> came<00:01:42.060> through<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.450> actually<00:01:42.570> pop

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stick came through and actually pop

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
stick came through and actually pop
while<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.290> tire<00:01:43.500> pulse<00:01:43.799> happens<00:01:44.700> all<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
while your tire pulse happens all the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.070 
while your tire pulse happens all the
time<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.600> one

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
time or just one

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.370 
time or just one
goes<00:01:46.200> down<00:01:46.230> gets<00:01:46.860> cut<00:01:47.100> whatever<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.140> ball

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
goes down gets cut whatever if the ball

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.320 
goes down gets cut whatever if the ball
that<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:49.680> started<00:01:50.160> with<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.940> put<00:01:51.150> all

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
that you started with that you put all

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.420 
that you started with that you put all
that<00:01:51.360> air<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.200> great<00:01:52.920> big<00:01:53.280> okay<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.600> pops

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
that air in great big okay and it pops

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
that air in great big okay and it pops
all<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.730> rest<00:01:56.910> of<00:01:57.090> balls<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.630> move

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
all the rest of balls are going to move

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.270 
all the rest of balls are going to move
in<00:01:58.080> but<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.470> don't<00:01:58.650> have<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> same<00:01:58.980> amount

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
in but they don't have the same amount

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.060 
in but they don't have the same amount
of<00:01:59.490> air<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.300> you're<00:02:01.230> actually<00:02:01.440> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.770> start

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
of air so you're actually going to start

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.860 
of air so you're actually going to start
to<00:02:02.190> feel<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> flat<00:02:03.090> tire<00:02:03.120> if<00:02:03.690> you

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
to feel like you have a flat tire if you

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.290 
to feel like you have a flat tire if you
blow<00:02:04.470> more<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.040> couple<00:02:05.220> balls<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.910> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
blow more than a couple balls if you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.260 
blow more than a couple balls if you
have<00:02:06.660> all<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:08.010> with<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.190> same<00:02:08.399> volume<00:02:08.910> of

have all of them with the same volume of
air<00:02:09.510> in<00:02:09.720> them<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.250> won't<00:02:11.250> notice<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
air in them you won't notice the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.850 
air in them you won't notice the
difference<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:14.090> pop<00:02:15.090> balls<00:02:15.420> until<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.710> up

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
difference of pop balls until you get up

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.540 
difference of pop balls until you get up
into<00:02:17.070> about<00:02:17.280> four<00:02:17.670> or<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.950> tire<00:02:19.950> balls<00:02:20.250> pump

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
into about four or more tire balls pump

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.680 
into about four or more tire balls pump
and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.340> demonstrated<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:24.180> multi-port

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
and then I demonstrated a the multi-port

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.020 
and then I demonstrated a the multi-port
inflator<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.830> thing<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.220> awesome<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
inflator this thing is just awesome I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660 
inflator this thing is just awesome I
love<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.350> first<00:02:28.590> time<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.920> saw<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.459> couple

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
love it the first time I saw a couple

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
years ago I've been on tire balls to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.800 
years ago I've been on tire balls to
build<00:02:32.220> me<00:02:32.340> another<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.850> I'm<00:02:33.030> pretty<00:02:33.330> sure<00:02:33.570> if

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
build me another one I'm pretty sure if

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.420 
build me another one I'm pretty sure if
your<00:02:33.990> handyman<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.800> could<00:02:34.920> probably<00:02:35.100> make<00:02:35.280> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
your handyman you could probably make it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.699 
your handyman you could probably make it
yourself<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:36.090> didn't<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.350> bought

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
tire ball as well nitrogen just doesn't

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.060 
tire ball as well nitrogen just doesn't
fluctuate<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.330> much<00:03:03.600> with<00:03:04.019> heat<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.769> we're

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
fluctuate as much with heat I know we're

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.420 
fluctuate as much with heat I know we're
talking<00:03:05.400> very<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.840> know<00:03:06.959> psi<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.890> the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
talking very little you know psi in the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.080 
talking very little you know psi in the
tires<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.060> an<00:03:09.180> entire<00:03:09.450> balls<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.850> tire

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
tires and an entire balls but the tire

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.410 
tires and an entire balls but the tire
balls<00:03:12.420> will<00:03:13.019> move<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:14.130> each<00:03:14.370> other<00:03:14.610> inside<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
balls will move on each other inside the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.470 
balls will move on each other inside the
tire<00:03:15.840> carcass<00:03:16.560> itself<00:03:17.100> whether<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.850> even

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
tire carcass itself whether you even

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.270 
tire carcass itself whether you even
more<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.110> have<00:03:19.260> air<00:03:19.500> over<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.830> top<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
more so if you have air over the top of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.150 
more so if you have air over the top of
them<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:21.570> what<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.810> does<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> heats<00:03:22.980> up

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
them so what that does is that heats up

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.250 
them so what that does is that heats up
a<00:03:23.250> tire<00:03:23.459> balls<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.750> hits<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.989> tire

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
a tire balls and when it hits a tire

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.070 
a tire balls and when it hits a tire
ball<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.709> heats<00:03:26.130> up<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.370> air<00:03:26.489> inside<00:03:27.080> normal

air that we breathe every day you know

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.780 
air that we breathe every day you know
you've<00:03:30.840> seen<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.050> bag<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.470> chips<00:03:31.739> okay<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.280> mean

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you've seen a bag of chips okay I mean

you've seen a bag of chips okay I mean
that<00:03:33.000> expand<00:03:33.840> they'll<00:03:34.200> contract<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.709> do

whatever that's what air does nitrogen

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.680

is<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.709> little<00:03:37.890> bit<00:03:38.010> more<00:03:38.190> stable<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.450> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
is a little bit more stable and it it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.380 
is a little bit more stable and it it
doesn't<00:03:39.989> do<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:41.489> does<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.209> have<00:03:42.330> to
