putting<00:03:22.849> off<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.000> ending<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.660> reality

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
putting off the ending of this reality

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.599 
putting off the ending of this reality
for<00:03:24.230> some<00:03:24.410> reason<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:25.040> thing<00:03:25.190> about<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
for some reason the thing about the

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.280 
for some reason the thing about the
Leviathan<00:03:26.120> trilogy<00:03:26.480> is<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.780> don't<00:03:27.109> think

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
Leviathan trilogy is that I don't think

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.539 
Leviathan trilogy is that I don't think
I<00:03:27.410> would<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.620> enjoyed<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.250> there<00:03:28.400> weren't

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
I would have enjoyed it if there weren't

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.830 
I would have enjoyed it if there weren't
pictures<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.269> there<00:03:29.480> are<00:03:29.569> so<00:03:29.690> many

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
pictures in it there are so many

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.720

interesting<00:03:30.139> creatures<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.220> pieces<00:03:31.609> of

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.460 
by Allie Brosh this book is hilarious
and<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.090> think<00:03:50.329> one<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.599> reasons<00:03:50.959> why<00:03:51.109> it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
and I think one of the reasons why it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.289 
and I think one of the reasons why it's
so<00:03:51.680> funny<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.190> because<00:03:52.579> of<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:52.970> pictures

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
pictures the pictures are what really

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.680

added<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.130> humorous<00:04:16.729> factors<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.419> story

if<00:04:18.079> there<00:04:18.919> weren't<00:04:19.070> pictures<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.549> here<00:04:19.729> I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
if there weren't pictures in here I

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.130 
if there weren't pictures in here I
don't<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.359> would<00:04:20.479> have<00:04:20.510> laughed<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:20.989> much

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
freakin ready I do think that this book

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.260
