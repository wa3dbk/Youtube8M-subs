00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.520 

this<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.420> one<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> great<00:03:34.110> things<00:03:34.140> about

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
this is one of the great things about

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.980 
this is one of the great things about
using<00:03:35.460> mineral<00:03:36.390> powder<00:03:37.350> foundations<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.990> that

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
using mineral powder foundations is that

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:53.440 
using mineral powder foundations is that
the<00:03:40.320> application<00:03:40.890> process<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:43.200> super<00:03:43.890> quick

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.010 

and<00:03:53.870> that's<00:03:54.170> basically<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:56.540> coverage<00:03:56.870> i

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
and that's basically it the coverage i

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.559 
and that's basically it the coverage i
would<00:03:57.230> say<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:57.739> sort<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.190> light<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:59.390> medium

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
would say it's sort of a light to medium

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.280 
would say it's sort of a light to medium
coverage<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:01.459> would<00:04:01.730> be<00:04:01.849> great<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.420> covering

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
coverage it would be great for covering

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.670 
there you go that's basically it that's
how<00:06:00.840> long<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:01.259> would<00:06:01.410> take<00:06:01.639> to<00:06:03.620> apply<00:06:04.620> the

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
how long it would take to apply the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.800 
how long it would take to apply the
foundation<00:06:04.919> and<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.639> concealer<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:06.599> as<00:06:06.720> you

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
foundation and the concealer so as you

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.170 
foundation and the concealer so as you
can<00:06:06.930> see<00:06:07.110> it's<00:06:07.319> very<00:06:07.380> very<00:06:07.919> quick<00:06:08.220> 20<00:06:08.610> with

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
can see it's very very quick 20 with

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.189 
can see it's very very quick 20 with
mineral<00:06:09.599> powder<00:06:10.470> foundations<00:06:11.509> however<00:06:12.509> I

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
mineral powder foundations however I

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.990 
mineral powder foundations however I
think<00:06:13.740> for<00:06:14.039> my<00:06:14.400> preference<00:06:14.970> I<00:06:15.150> feel<00:06:15.630> like<00:06:15.960> the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
think for my preference I feel like the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.339 
think for my preference I feel like the
liquid<00:06:18.000> foundations<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:18.930> cream<00:06:19.110> based

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
liquid foundations and cream based

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.850 
liquid foundations and cream based
foundations<00:06:19.979> I<00:06:20.099> just<00:06:20.280> feel<00:06:20.460> like<00:06:20.610> it's<00:06:20.880> more

more<00:06:22.860> moldable<00:06:23.639> to<00:06:23.819> your<00:06:24.000> skin<00:06:24.720> and<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.430> blends

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
more moldable to your skin and it blends

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.890 
more moldable to your skin and it blends
much<00:06:26.759> nicer<00:06:27.300> when<00:06:27.900> it<00:06:28.050> warms<00:06:28.259> up<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.530> your<00:06:28.830> skin

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
much nicer when it warms up to your skin

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.899 
much nicer when it warms up to your skin
