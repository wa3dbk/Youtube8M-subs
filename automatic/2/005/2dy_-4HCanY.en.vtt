00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.709
 every year one of us in his own 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.930
 tax return can be donated 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.690
 5 per thousand 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.439
 but what is this five families is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 clarified both directly and the agency 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.620
 revenue good morning what is 5 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 per thousand who can use it 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.320
 good morning everyone 5 per thousand is it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.940
 tool devised by the legislator for 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
 allow tax payers to 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.069
 participate directly in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 financing of activities that have a 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:39.239
 social importance we go 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.429
 in fact from scientific research to 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.979
 university health research to 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.539
 voluntary bodies the activities carried out 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.949
 from the municipality and sports associations 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.979
 amateur 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.920
 how does 5 per thousand work? 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:54.629
 tax payer presenting his own 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.049
 tax return has the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.789
 possibility of allocating a quota of the 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.309
 taxes that you should pay to the tax authorities 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.799
 precisely the 5 per thousand 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.780
 signing in the appropriate box and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.100
 possibly indicating in this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.649
 also the tax code 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.619
 of the body of the association which it intends 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.360
 allocate your contribution and a 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.899
 what are the bodies that can 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.479
 participate in it and what the class for 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.130
 regarding the entities that can 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 participate and these are categories 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.649
 rather numerous because we start from 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.530
 bodies of the voluntary sector and therefore of bodies that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.820
 deal with non-profit activities and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 this case the legislator has 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.140
 identified specific categories 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 we are talking about organizations of 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.270
 volunteering promotion associations 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.100
 social the non-profit associations 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 foundations that have obtained the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.969
 personality recognition 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.289
 legal private law the 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.409
 amateur sports associations 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.299
 then other activities such as the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.299
 scientific research, health research 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.640
 at the university and the activities carried out by 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.649
 common of own residence 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.999
 what institutions and organizations need to do 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.940
 associations that wish to benefit 

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.130
 of 5 per thousand 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.350
 as regards in particular 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.330
 the voluntary organizations therefore the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.330
 bodies of which the agency of 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.670
 income must be presented every year 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.770
 so I recommend it every year 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 the first year is not enough for 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.930
 to be entitled to the following years also 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.370
 an electronic application using 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.990
 the appropriate software that year by year 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 is made available by the agency 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.120
 of revenue on your site is 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.830
 You can use this software with 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.830
 the appropriate authorization to services 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.360
 telematics to request which vi 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.910
 you can contact any office 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.670
 of the revenue agency or using 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.800
 an intermediary enabled the application 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.440
 telematics must be transmitted in a 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.100
 period that tends to go from 21 of 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.140
 March to 7 May each year one 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.660
 once the electronic request has been sent e 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.120
 necessary to fulfill another 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 obligation that the sending of the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.900
 declaration in lieu of an act 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.480
 notorious that it should be done to me 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.540
 I recommend by registered mail with receipt 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.080
 return via pec under penalty of 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.390
 forfeiture must be signed by 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.820
 legal representative and always under penalty of 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.040
 forfeiture of the declaration must 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.080
 a copy of the document of 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.959
 identity of the legal representative 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.150
 all these obligations then the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.300
 online application and declaration 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.130
 substitute sent in those ways 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.320
 are obligations provided for 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.750
 decadence what it means means 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.600
 that if I forget it only 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.269
 one or for example beyond the terms 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.400
 provided for by the law lapses from 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.430
 benefit even if I have the requirement 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.459
 subjective for about two years legislator 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.220
 and then lets through the institute 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.800
 of the amnesty to proceed to 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.350
 any in compliance by 30 of 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.400
 September and at the same time paying the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.790
 258 euro penalty knows what i am 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.709
 times to receive the 5 per thousand 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.810
 disbursement of the contribution that takes place 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.580
 by the Ministry of Labor of the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.730
 social policies 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.590
 it is usually done two years later 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.239
 the presentation of the application then 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.299
 for example 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.430
 and now that we are in 2014 the ministry 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.770
 of labor and social policies is 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.400
 paying the contributions for 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.250
 then applications submitted in 2012 therefore 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.110
 this is usually the timing if 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.880
 problems are encountered in this 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.620
 meaning and therefore maybe the associations 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.940
 they are waiting for contributions 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.490
 relating to previous years 2009 2010 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.199
 2011 it is possible that there were gods 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.289
 problems in the communication of the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.389
 bank details to all 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.560
