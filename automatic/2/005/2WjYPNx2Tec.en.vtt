autist and put a gasket on this because
the<00:05:30.030> gasket<00:05:30.480> is<00:05:30.630> actually<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.290> set<00:05:31.500> of

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
the gasket is actually in the set of

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.710 
the gasket is actually in the set of
drawers<00:05:31.950> we've<00:05:32.669> got<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.090> out<00:05:33.240> from<00:05:33.570> that

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
drawers we've got this out from that

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960 
drawers we've got this out from that
can't<00:05:33.870> be<00:05:33.960> asked<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.260> find<00:05:34.470> it<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.890> imagine<00:05:35.820> the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
can't be asked to find it so imagine the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.270 
can't be asked to find it so imagine the
gasket<00:05:36.300> on<00:05:36.390> there<00:05:36.570> now<00:05:37.260> doing<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:37.890> cross

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
gasket on there now doing this cross

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.340 
gasket on there now doing this cross
pattern<00:05:38.669> means<00:05:39.270> there's<00:05:39.510> equal<00:05:39.780> torque<00:05:40.169> on

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
pattern means there's equal torque on

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.930 
pattern means there's equal torque on
each<00:05:40.470> screw<00:05:41.040> so<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.340> means<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.790> actually

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
each screw so that means it actually

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.920 
each screw so that means it actually
compresses<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:43.470> gaskets<00:05:44.720> evenly<00:05:45.720> so<00:05:45.900> you

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
compresses the gaskets evenly so you

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.640 
compresses the gaskets evenly so you
less<00:05:46.560> likely<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:47.160> leakage<00:05:48.290> we<00:05:49.290> then<00:05:49.440> go<00:05:49.560> on

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
less likely have leakage we then go on

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.500 
less likely have leakage we then go on
to<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.860> car<00:05:50.130> prepare<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.640> chalk<00:05:50.880> assembly

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
to the car prepare the chalk assembly

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.240 
to the car prepare the chalk assembly
which<00:05:51.660> is<00:05:51.690> just<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.050> plunger<00:05:52.470> down<00:05:52.860> inside<00:05:53.160> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
which is just a plunger down inside the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.250 
which is just a plunger down inside the
carburetor

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
carburetor

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.550 
carburetor
you<00:05:55.260> know<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.530> shot<00:05:55.800> goes<00:05:56.010> on<00:05:56.190> top<00:05:56.490> like<00:05:56.730> that

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
you know the shot goes on top like that

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.780 
you know the shot goes on top like that
and<00:05:58.560> then<00:05:58.680> got<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:58.980> side<00:05:59.190> assembly<00:05:59.669> that

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
and then got the side assembly that

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.250 
and then got the side assembly that
comes<00:06:00.030> in<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:01.260> just<00:06:01.530> drops<00:06:01.800> in<00:06:02.070> like<00:06:02.100> that<00:06:03.260> make

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
comes in it just drops in like that make

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.390 
comes in it just drops in like that make
sure<00:06:04.410> you<00:06:04.500> have<00:06:04.620> things<00:06:04.830> lined<00:06:05.040> up<00:06:05.220> on<00:06:05.370> the

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
sure you have things lined up on the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.360 
sure you have things lined up on the
crack<00:06:05.669> faces<00:06:06.360> stick<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.780> on<00:06:10.220> here's<00:06:11.220> one

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
crack faces stick that on here's one

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.750 
crack faces stick that on here's one
carburetor<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:14.130> has<00:06:14.250> gone<00:06:14.430> from<00:06:14.580> being

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
carburetor and that has gone from being

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.720 
carburetor and that has gone from being
dismount<00:06:15.180> there<00:06:15.450> being<00:06:15.780> one<00:06:16.280> full<00:06:17.280> assembly

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
dismount there being one full assembly

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.280 
dismount there being one full assembly
to<00:06:17.880> being<00:06:18.060> dismantled<00:06:18.330> and<00:06:18.810> back<00:06:18.930> into<00:06:19.169> an

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
to being dismantled and back into an

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.070 
to being dismantled and back into an
assembly<00:06:19.800> in<00:06:19.830> less<00:06:20.100> than<00:06:20.630> I'll<00:06:21.630> see<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:21.900> less

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
assembly in less than I'll see in less

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.190 
assembly in less than I'll see in less
than<00:06:22.200> five<00:06:22.410> minutes<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:23.780> now<00:06:24.780> we<00:06:24.840> have<00:06:25.050> the

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
than five minutes and now we have the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.610 
than five minutes and now we have the
fun<00:06:25.410> of<00:06:25.520> disassembly

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
fun of disassembly

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.730 
fun of disassembly
I<00:06:26.650> mean<00:06:27.640> they're<00:06:28.180> just<00:06:28.210> in<00:06:28.600> it<00:06:28.960> one<00:06:29.380> thing<00:06:29.620> I've

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
I mean they're just in it one thing I've

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.290 
I mean they're just in it one thing I've
just<00:06:29.770> remembered<00:06:30.190> that<00:06:30.640> I<00:06:30.700> forgot<00:06:30.760> to<00:06:31.090> take

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
just remembered that I forgot to take

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.890 
just remembered that I forgot to take
out<00:06:31.480> was<00:06:31.690> this<00:06:31.810> EM<00:06:32.730> mix<00:06:33.730> just<00:06:33.940> screwy<00:06:34.210> but<00:06:34.660> I

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
out was this EM mix just screwy but I

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.540 
out was this EM mix just screwy but I
think<00:06:35.170> that<00:06:35.290> would<00:06:35.380> add<00:06:35.530> added<00:06:36.190> to<00:06:36.280> just

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
think that would add added to just

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.950 
think that would add added to just
around<00:06:36.730> about<00:06:36.850> five<00:06:37.090> seconds<00:06:37.420> on<00:06:37.570> at<00:06:37.690> the<00:06:37.780> time

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
around about five seconds on at the time

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.210 
around about five seconds on at the time
so<00:06:38.320> we'll<00:06:39.100> just<00:06:39.280> ignore<00:06:39.400> that<00:06:40.110> but<00:06:41.110> yeah<00:06:41.350> this

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
so we'll just ignore that but yeah this

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.950 
so we'll just ignore that but yeah this
this<00:06:42.490> just<00:06:42.730> shows<00:06:42.880> a<00:06:42.940> purple<00:06:43.480> that<00:06:43.600> they<00:06:43.720> don't

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
this just shows a purple that they don't

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.510 
this just shows a purple that they don't
be<00:06:44.110> scared<00:06:44.410> of<00:06:44.530> them<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.800> other<00:06:44.950> neat<00:06:45.280> they

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
be scared of them the other neat they

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.860 
be scared of them the other neat they
are<00:06:45.730> an<00:06:45.850> easy<00:06:46.060> thing<00:06:46.510> to<00:06:47.170> work<00:06:47.380> with<00:06:48.720> read<00:06:49.720> the

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
are an easy thing to work with read the

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.510 
are an easy thing to work with read the
bottom<00:06:50.140> first<00:06:50.350> because<00:06:51.010> I<00:06:51.190> could<00:06:51.370> see

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
bottom first because I could see

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.430 
bottom first because I could see
mixtures<00:06:52.090> and<00:06:52.240> stuff<00:06:52.450> up<00:06:52.630> you<00:06:52.930> need<00:06:53.110> a<00:06:53.140> bit<00:06:53.350> of

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
mixtures and stuff up you need a bit of

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.710 
mixtures and stuff up you need a bit of
an<00:06:53.560> ear<00:06:53.680> for<00:06:53.890> them<00:06:54.010> but<00:06:54.760> to<00:06:54.970> strip<00:06:55.240> a<00:06:55.270> card<00:06:55.540> let

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
an ear for them but to strip a card let

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.260 
an ear for them but to strip a card let
it<00:06:55.810> clean<00:06:56.080> it<00:06:56.320> and<00:06:56.560> do<00:06:57.250> everything<00:06:57.640> that<00:06:58.120> you

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
it clean it and do everything that you

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.290 
it clean it and do everything that you
need<00:06:58.420> me<00:06:58.660> and<00:06:58.780> then<00:06:58.930> slice<00:06:59.170> is<00:06:59.350> not<00:06:59.530> scary<00:07:00.300> CV

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
need me and then slice is not scary CV

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.200 
need me and then slice is not scary CV
Kaaba<00:07:01.660> is<00:07:01.960> a<00:07:01.990> slightly<00:07:02.350> different<00:07:03.090> but<00:07:04.090> I've

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
Kaaba is a slightly different but I've

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.790 
Kaaba is a slightly different but I've
got<00:07:04.360> mummy-ji<00:07:04.750> s<00:07:04.900> as<00:07:05.080> well<00:07:05.260> and<00:07:05.590> they're

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
got mummy-ji s as well and they're

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.040 
got mummy-ji s as well and they're
basically<00:07:06.010> I've<00:07:06.670> done<00:07:07.330> the<00:07:07.510> bottom<00:07:07.660> end<00:07:07.870> of

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
basically I've done the bottom end of

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.840 
basically I've done the bottom end of
them<00:07:08.170> to<00:07:08.410> change<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.830> Jets<00:07:09.070> over<00:07:09.550> because

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
them to change the Jets over because

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.540 
them to change the Jets over because
when<00:07:10.180> I've<00:07:10.330> been<00:07:10.360> doing<00:07:10.930> the<00:07:11.680> K&amp;N<00:07:11.920> filter<00:07:12.100> and

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
when I've been doing the K&amp;N filter and

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.280 
when I've been doing the K&amp;N filter and
the<00:07:12.610> exhaust<00:07:13.000> and<00:07:13.270> stuff<00:07:13.480> you<00:07:13.600> have<00:07:13.720> to<00:07:13.750> mess

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
the exhaust and stuff you have to mess

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.440 
the exhaust and stuff you have to mess
around<00:07:14.440> with<00:07:14.620> jets<00:07:15.040> for<00:07:15.340> a<00:07:15.580> week<00:07:15.880> or<00:07:16.060> so<00:07:16.240> before

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
around with jets for a week or so before

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.630 
around with jets for a week or so before
you<00:07:16.600> get<00:07:16.690> mixtures<00:07:17.170> right<00:07:17.350> and<00:07:18.220> they're<00:07:18.400> just

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
you get mixtures right and they're just

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.810 
you get mixtures right and they're just
as<00:07:18.790> easy<00:07:18.970> on<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:19.270> bottom<00:07:19.510> end<00:07:19.600> so<00:07:20.590> yeah<00:07:20.820> that's
