00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to everyone who watches this video now 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.960
 I want to show how removed and put 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.900
 elementary armrest which I imagine 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:19.010
 ordered this form 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.010
 put on the so -called ski 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:31.529
 take it off and so that's just really 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 what speaks of its strength here itself 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.730
 the armrest can be seen here a little more 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 hurt belt buckles but this is not true 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:49.620
 sad and well, respectively 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.329
 setting just put it base we jump 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.329
 forward all 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:15.820
 tight nothing disappears 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 pick do not go that is recommend 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:27.910
 buy a box by itself 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.660
 a lot of volume well why you can throw well 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.930
 and accordingly the handbrake does not interfere 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.990
 fastened too here please also 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.070
 Here at my height in meter eighty 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.509
 one that is here is the distance of someone I'm 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.270
 principle it can be regulated yet 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.550
 further closer to the student to put but I do not 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.070
 I began to do this, that is, it is convenient for me 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 so sit down and knot miss raising 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:01.660
 all hand lies on the shift lever 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:06.060
 gears that is, here he is sitting principle 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.060
 dead and nowhere up and down does not climb 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.429
 so here are the settings here
