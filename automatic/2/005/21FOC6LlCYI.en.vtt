00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
aged it should and I don't know if this

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.330 
aged it should and I don't know if this
is<00:05:53.790> Mattel's<00:05:54.420> attention<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.380> detail<00:05:55.860> on<00:05:56.160> me

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
is Mattel's attention to detail on me

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.250 
is Mattel's attention to detail on me
projecting<00:05:57.000> it<00:05:57.150> on<00:05:57.330> but<00:05:57.570> it<00:05:57.660> seems<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.080> the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
projecting it on but it seems like the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.380 
projecting it on but it seems like the
pecs<00:05:58.500> aren't<00:05:58.860> quite<00:05:59.040> as<00:05:59.220> big<00:05:59.430> right<00:05:59.700> of<00:06:00.090> all<00:06:00.240> of

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
pecs aren't quite as big right of all of

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.720 
pecs aren't quite as big right of all of
them<00:06:00.540> I'd<00:06:00.690> say<00:06:00.720> most<00:06:01.440> ripped<00:06:01.980> goes<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.580> the

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
them I'd say most ripped goes to the

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.000 
them I'd say most ripped goes to the
basic<00:06:03.210> figure<00:06:03.450> putting<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.200> Hulk<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.710> Hulk

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
basic figure putting the Hulk in Hulk

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.920

Hogan<00:06:05.580> seems<00:06:06.000> with<00:06:06.150> all<00:06:06.390> of<00:06:06.570> them<00:06:06.750> though

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
Hogan seems with all of them though

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.020 
Hogan seems with all of them though
Mattel<00:06:07.350> have<00:06:07.500> shied<00:06:07.800> away<00:06:07.830> from<00:06:08.160> Hogan's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
Mattel have shied away from Hogan's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.780 
Mattel have shied away from Hogan's
mahogany<00:06:09.840> wood<00:06:10.110> stain<00:06:10.530> tan<00:06:10.920> and<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:11.430> think<00:06:11.640> all

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
mahogany wood stain tan and I think all

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.790 
mahogany wood stain tan and I think all
would<00:06:11.940> have<00:06:12.090> benefited<00:06:12.750> from<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:13.200> skin<00:06:13.500> tones

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
would have benefited from the skin tones

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800 
would have benefited from the skin tones
being<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.250> shade<00:06:14.490> darker<00:06:15.030> now<00:06:15.390> looking<00:06:15.690> at

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
being a shade darker now looking at

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.810 
being a shade darker now looking at
articulation<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:16.770> this<00:06:16.890> is<00:06:17.040> where<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.250> basic

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
articulation and this is where a basic

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.060 
articulation and this is where a basic
figure<00:06:18.180> just<00:06:18.390> doesn't<00:06:18.930> cut<00:06:19.170> it<00:06:19.320> for<00:06:19.350> me<00:06:19.680> the

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
figure just doesn't cut it for me the

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.340 
figure just doesn't cut it for me the
hips<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.460> legs<00:06:20.610> move<00:06:20.910> forward<00:06:21.390> and<00:06:21.570> back<00:06:21.810> okay

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
hips the legs move forward and back okay

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.409

Hogan<00:06:59.020> I'm<00:06:59.140> looking<00:06:59.470> from<00:06:59.650> a<00:06:59.770> collector's

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
Hogan I'm looking from a collector's

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.820 
Hogan I'm looking from a collector's
perspective<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.300> for<00:07:01.870> that<00:07:01.990> you<00:07:02.320> just<00:07:02.560> don't

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
perspective and for that you just don't

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.130 
perspective and for that you just don't
cut<00:07:03.100> it<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.490> also<00:07:03.640> just<00:07:04.120> on<00:07:04.330> principle<00:07:04.630> I<00:07:05.110> have

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.140 
cut it and also just on principle I have

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.770 
cut it and also just on principle I have
to<00:07:05.530> eliminate<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:06.220> basic<00:07:06.700> Hulk<00:07:06.970> Hogan<00:07:07.450> just

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
to eliminate the basic Hulk Hogan just

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.140 
to eliminate the basic Hulk Hogan just
because<00:07:08.110> I<00:07:08.140> require<00:07:08.650> more<00:07:08.980> articulation<00:07:09.820> that

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
because I require more articulation that

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.060 
because I require more articulation that
it<00:07:10.270> offers<00:07:10.660> with<00:07:10.990> the<00:07:11.170> elite<00:07:11.410> and<00:07:11.620> defining

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
it offers with the elite and defining

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.450 
it offers with the elite and defining
moments<00:07:12.790> it's<00:07:13.150> clothes<00:07:13.800> inflated<00:07:14.800> price<00:07:15.130> tag

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
moments it's clothes inflated price tag

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.520 
moments it's clothes inflated price tag
at<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:15.730> defining<00:07:16.060> moments<00:07:16.720> one<00:07:16.930> makes<00:07:17.290> me

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
at the defining moments one makes me

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.070 
at the defining moments one makes me
resent<00:07:17.980> it<00:07:18.250> a<00:07:18.370> little<00:07:18.610> so<00:07:19.180> I'm<00:07:19.450> going<00:07:19.720> with<00:07:19.930> the

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
resent it a little so I'm going with the

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.190 
resent it a little so I'm going with the
modern<00:07:20.500> elite<00:07:20.920> Hulk<00:07:21.250> Hogan<00:07:21.760> from<00:07:21.970> series<00:07:22.480> 34

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
modern elite Hulk Hogan from series 34

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.560 
modern elite Hulk Hogan from series 34
but<00:07:23.530> really<00:07:23.860> in<00:07:24.130> my<00:07:24.340> mind<00:07:24.610> I<00:07:24.820> have<00:07:25.030> the<00:07:25.180> picture

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
but really in my mind I have the picture

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.690 
but really in my mind I have the picture
of<00:07:25.690> the<00:07:25.810> perfect<00:07:26.050> Hulk<00:07:26.500> Hogan<00:07:26.890> action<00:07:27.340> figure

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
of the perfect Hulk Hogan action figure

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.030 
of the perfect Hulk Hogan action figure
and<00:07:27.850> none<00:07:28.330> of<00:07:28.480> these<00:07:28.660> quite<00:07:29.050> match<00:07:29.320> up<00:07:29.350> to<00:07:29.890> it

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
and none of these quite match up to it

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.190 
and none of these quite match up to it
perhaps<00:07:30.370> among<00:07:30.970> them<00:07:31.210> you<00:07:31.390> could<00:07:31.570> take<00:07:31.810> parts

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200 
perhaps among them you could take parts

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.110 
perhaps among them you could take parts
from<00:07:32.290> each<00:07:32.680> and<00:07:32.980> achieve<00:07:33.310> my<00:07:33.550> mental<00:07:33.940> image

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
from each and achieve my mental image

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.270 
from each and achieve my mental image
