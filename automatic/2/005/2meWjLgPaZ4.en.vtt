00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
them through so you get a nice swirl and
then<00:02:10.920> turn<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.670> mixture<00:02:12.060> out<00:02:12.330> onto<00:02:12.870> some

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
then turn this mixture out onto some

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.970 
then turn this mixture out onto some
flour<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.430> your<00:02:15.090> surface<00:02:15.300> pours<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:16.769> flour

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
flour on your surface pours the flour

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.900 
flour on your surface pours the flour
there<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.420> scrape<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.840> mixture<00:02:19.410> out

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
there and just scrape that mixture out

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140 
there and just scrape that mixture out
give<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> good<00:02:21.150> sprinkle<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> some<00:02:21.989> flour

give it a good sprinkle of some flour

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.729 
give it a good sprinkle of some flour
so<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.329> Pat<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.569> out<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.019> about<00:02:26.290> one

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
so just Pat it out to about one

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.410 
so just Pat it out to about one
centimeter<00:02:27.129> in<00:02:27.700> thickness<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:28.239> don't

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
centimeter in thickness you don't

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.880 
centimeter in thickness you don't
actually<00:02:28.540> need<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.870> rolling<00:02:29.170> pin<00:02:29.409> because<00:02:29.739> it's

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
actually need a rolling pin because it's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.229
