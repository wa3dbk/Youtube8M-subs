00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
an old horse trailer and then I figured
out<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.330> opens<00:02:31.720> up<00:02:32.110> like<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.250> not

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
out that it opens up like that and not

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.910 
out that it opens up like that and not
down<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.360> didn't<00:02:34.690> really<00:02:34.720> look<00:02:34.930> good<00:02:35.080> so

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
down so it didn't really look good so

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.620 
down so it didn't really look good so
this<00:02:36.069> is<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> isolation<00:02:36.910> barn<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.390> some
