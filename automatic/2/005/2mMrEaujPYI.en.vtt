head is actually covered unlike every

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.580 
head is actually covered unlike every
other<00:02:59.160> Megatron<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.459> line<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.940> head<00:03:01.239> is

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
other Megatron this line the head is

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.490 
other Megatron this line the head is
actually<00:03:02.590> covered<00:03:03.840> thank<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:10.170> well<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.350> you

call<00:03:11.709> by<00:03:11.860> rolling<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:18.489> missiles<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:20.370> you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
call by rolling the missiles in you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
call by rolling the missiles in you
can't<00:03:21.670> fire<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> missiles<00:03:22.630> when<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.660> jet

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
can't fire the missiles when it's in jet

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.750 
can't fire the missiles when it's in jet
mode<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.580> that's<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.730> Down<00:03:27.940> point<00:03:29.519> under<00:03:30.519> then

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
mode so that's a Down point under then

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.430 
mode so that's a Down point under then
dad<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.150> very<00:03:31.390> good<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.880> think<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:34.989> might<00:03:35.230> be<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
dad it's very good I think it might be a

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.160 
dad it's very good I think it might be a
low<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.890> pricey<00:03:36.430> for<00:03:36.959> those<00:03:37.959> bit<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:40.360> it's

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
low to pricey for those bit but it's

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.080 
low to pricey for those bit but it's
still<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.470> pretty<00:03:41.680> good<00:03:41.920> figure<00:03:44.610> it's<00:03:45.610> kind<00:03:45.970> of

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
still a pretty good figure it's kind of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.320 
still a pretty good figure it's kind of
hard<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.420> find<00:03:46.780> actually<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:50.430> found<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.610> that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.340 

have<00:03:55.330> this<00:03:55.540> at<00:03:55.720> target<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.980> if<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:58.260> want<00:03:59.260> to

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
have this at target so if you want to

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.930
