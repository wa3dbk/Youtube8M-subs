enough and then we're going to create

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.300 
enough and then we're going to create
half<00:03:07.390> moons<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.380> zucchini<00:03:08.740> was<00:03:08.980> smaller

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310

dish<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.680> will<00:05:13.800> help<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.160> cook<00:05:14.370> even

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
dish and that will help this cook even

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.190 
dish and that will help this cook even
quicker<00:05:14.850> this<00:05:15.420> shouldn't<00:05:15.720> take<00:05:15.780> more<00:05:16.140> than

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
quicker this shouldn't take more than

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.520 
quicker this shouldn't take more than
eight<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.590> ten<00:05:16.800> minutes<00:05:18.050> ever<00:05:19.050> try<00:05:19.260> to<00:05:19.320> cook

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
eight to ten minutes ever try to cook

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.550 
eight to ten minutes ever try to cook
fish<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:19.980> have<00:05:20.100> it<00:05:20.220> turn<00:05:20.400> out<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:20.880> this<00:05:21.840> well

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
fish and have it turn out like this well

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.860 
fish and have it turn out like this well
question<00:05:23.310> everyone<00:05:23.760> has<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.120> how<00:05:24.600> do<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:24.780> know

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
question everyone has is how do I know

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.840 
question everyone has is how do I know
when<00:05:25.080> it's<00:05:25.110> done<00:05:25.350> now<00:05:26.190> there's<00:05:26.400> two<00:05:26.580> ways<00:05:26.790> to

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
when it's done now there's two ways to

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.180 
when it's done now there's two ways to
see<00:05:27.330> if<00:05:27.510> fish<00:05:27.750> is<00:05:27.930> done<00:05:28.110> color<00:05:28.890> and

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
see if fish is done color and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.670 
see if fish is done color and
consistency<00:05:29.780> let's<00:05:30.780> check<00:05:30.960> consistency

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
consistency let's check consistency

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.100 
consistency let's check consistency
first<00:05:31.950> what<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:32.550> want<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.150> is<00:05:33.840> take<00:05:34.080> a

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
first what you want to do is take a

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.800 
first what you want to do is take a
knife<00:05:34.440> or<00:05:34.770> skewer<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.490> poke<00:05:36.210> through<00:05:36.630> the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
knife or skewer and poke through the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.740 
knife or skewer and poke through the
fish<00:05:37.050> if<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:38.220> knife<00:05:38.520> Pierce's<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.420> fish

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
fish if the knife Pierce's the fish

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.800 
fish if the knife Pierce's the fish
easily<00:05:40.380> it's<00:05:41.340> done<00:05:41.610> if<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:42.360> meet<00:05:42.600> some

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
easily it's done if you meet some

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.680 
easily it's done if you meet some
resistance<00:05:43.380> then<00:05:44.010> it<00:05:44.160> needs<00:05:44.340> more<00:05:44.610> time<00:05:44.880> the

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
resistance then it needs more time the

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.630 
resistance then it needs more time the
second<00:05:46.080> way<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.200> tell<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.620> by<00:05:46.680> color<00:05:47.130> what

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
second way to tell is by color what

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.220 
second way to tell is by color what
we're<00:05:47.790> looking<00:05:48.090> for<00:05:48.120> is<00:05:48.630> for<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:48.990> fish<00:05:49.200> to

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
we're looking for is for the fish to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.950 
we're looking for is for the fish to
change<00:05:49.740> from<00:05:50.040> that<00:05:50.190> translucent<00:05:50.880> to<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.660> nice

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
change from that translucent to a nice

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.500 
change from that translucent to a nice
solid<00:05:52.290> white<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.950> if<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:53.460> take<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.669> look<00:05:53.790> that's

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
solid white and if we take a look that's

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.530 
solid white and if we take a look that's
exactly<00:05:54.750> what<00:05:55.290> we've<00:05:55.440> achieved<00:05:56.300> look<00:05:57.300> at<00:05:57.390> that

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
exactly what we've achieved look at that

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.380 
exactly what we've achieved look at that
ten<00:05:58.020> minutes<00:05:58.380> tops<00:05:58.620> hardly<00:05:59.550> any<00:05:59.669> clean<00:06:00.030> up<00:06:00.180> all

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
ten minutes tops hardly any clean up all

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.360 
ten minutes tops hardly any clean up all
the<00:06:00.690> flavor<00:06:00.840> nutrition<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.650> need<00:06:01.740> baked

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
the flavor nutrition you need baked

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.950 
the flavor nutrition you need baked
flounder<00:06:02.580> with<00:06:03.000> vegetables<00:06:03.510> what<00:06:03.720> could<00:06:03.870> be

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
flounder with vegetables what could be

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.280 
flounder with vegetables what could be
easier<00:06:05.120> now<00:06:06.120> let's<00:06:06.330> check<00:06:06.540> our<00:06:06.690> salmon<00:06:07.140> it's

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
easier now let's check our salmon it's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.810 
easier now let's check our salmon it's
been<00:06:07.500> poaching<00:06:07.710> for<00:06:08.040> about<00:06:08.190> eight<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.460> ten

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
been poaching for about eight to ten

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.700 
been poaching for about eight to ten
minutes<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.330> just<00:06:09.390> like<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.140> flounder<00:06:10.560> we're

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
minutes and just like the flounder we're

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.409 
minutes and just like the flounder we're
looking<00:06:10.980> for<00:06:11.160> two<00:06:11.340> things<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.850> make<00:06:12.000> sure<00:06:12.210> it's

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
looking for two things to make sure it's

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.230 
looking for two things to make sure it's
done<00:06:12.480> color<00:06:13.290> and<00:06:13.590> consistency<00:06:14.010> let's<00:06:15.000> check

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240
