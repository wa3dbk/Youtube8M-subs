 borussia I am very cordially in 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.950
 the new episode could and the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.080
 with his continued snapshots 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 Today there is a super length 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 fast and healthy quinoa and quinoa 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 recipe is some pronounce 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.010
 you know even a huge breakfast 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.750
 falls and huge waves of good ones 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 Breakfast which we really absolute 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 basis for a start in successful 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 oatmeal recipes knows yes 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 already a little bit varied today 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.510
 which one still often needs and as always 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 West equities pretty fast is like 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.030
 glass purpose by lay here the ingredients 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.130
 need a bowl of the microwaves 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 suitable we simply need one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.230
 Little children, for example, wonder 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.730
 campino a banana and optional one 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.379
 bit raider on the later again 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 one could do it all in the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 microwave or of course in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.079
 make an end effect on the stove 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.610
 I do not always feel great in the morning 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.960
 then simply wash the bowl 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.090
 can take it from it can eat 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 I think it's great to combine and some 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 maybe you also have a student 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 not always a hard one because of 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.550
 microwave definitely a very good one 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.149
 alternative 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 Just give your quinoa in committees 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 or 1 on the stove makes you ripped and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 cooking pot and there is about that 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.350
 Double the water I have here now 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.520
 For example, just under 200 milliliters of water 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.720
 the best already a bit 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 I wanted to go for a spice, for example 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.650
 just a little cinnamon then has 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.939
 the whole already a little taste 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.420
 ever unresolved that tears us already 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 now the whole thing is taking over 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 microwave for four minutes to full 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.119
 power so we are about now 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
 1000 watts you have to go after 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.299
 Just a little bit of a modern balance 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.299
 made the microwave 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 had 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.070
 of the world 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.540
 so love cinema is done now so 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.130
 made that first four minutes 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.690
 Also full of study would have done once 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 short simply with the gift quickly 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.570
 Unmoved in the end all good 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.100
 I have three again distributed 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.940
 Everything is up to the minute 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.970
 of course a bit of yours 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.710
 Microwave from now on already good 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 when the whole series is noticed 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.790
 that there are first signs at quinoa's 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.220
 is good that stays pretty long 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.720
 small and then go strong then 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.320
 Take this out of the microwave and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.220
 Now I have a little bit 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.490
 prepared the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.750
 you see the white mass is in 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.370
 end effect simply not 100 milliliters 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.920
 and have the whey protein 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.880
 has the advantage that it is the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.930
 all through the super delicious 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.460
 taste is whether that for example now 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.140
 as vanilla makes or the other 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.510
 protein taste can be taken there 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.370
 do not vary very well and gives that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.200
 give all flat super tasty 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.050
 because the cinema was already in itself 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 is very neutral now you can do that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.630
 because of course it all already 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.400
 liquid and dissolved here is easy 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.540
 what about that on the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.910
 Best short wrap 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.220
 RÃ¼tter with the mentioning that I am so 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.959
 Everything is well distributed and then it does 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.150
 then again for about one or two 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.950
 minutes in the microwave pay attention 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 if your companions are not that high 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.670
 now for example with me the whole 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.260
 Of course, it applies very much as well 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 a cooking pot of the fans but mostly 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.620
 itself not so noticeable cooking pot yes 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.250
 is pretty high 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.040
 you put in the very short 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.590
 microwave and thus live longer that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.820
 whole is done look really 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.220
 a super longer thing is already 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.510
 relatively strong consistency and thereby 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.800
 that in the end at the end of the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.130
 problem or even to give 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.660
 or the sauce that sucks that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.709
 Just shoot this entire murals 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.430
 or depending on what we much more 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.320
 tasted on the wonderful thing 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.820
 still just do it 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.700
 I already have a banana 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.800
 cut is simply banal stands 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.970
 Here's a super 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.930
 longer thing you can do the whole thing too 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.360
 for example, just a bit 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.410
 to bring in a change 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.640
 cut havel pieces you can 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.140
 the whole, for example, now one 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.690
 Last before where is the microwave 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.150
 just made that already there 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.010
 give fruits then have 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.780
 the end effect was just a nice one then 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.849
 Also a very tasty variation like me 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.909
 I often find myself at the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.849
 Oatmeal look at us 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.409
 just looks wonderful now 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.390
 I grab again here in mine 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:12.540
 dry fruits are a few of the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:14.099
 also raisin a bit over and over 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.019
 delicious human breakfast alone 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.699
 quinoa is already at just under 12 percent 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.650
 protein and about seven percent 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.400
 A great thing about the fiber 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.780
 day to start 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.340
 I can do that a little bit better now 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.750
 to make the indicators from the 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:33.840
 paradise always means super nice 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:36.900
 optics and in the end you have 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.220
 understood the coco or the one 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.070
 little bigger kongos player has 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.889
 Of course, that could be done too 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.970
 I want to say super delicious and one 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.199
 are naughty shot 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 they also contributed to the now also 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.820
 for example the city now are if 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.990
 For example not at all because he is in the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.570
 end effect already by the banana what 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.389
 this was the milk and mostly that 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.800
 either artificially or on 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.060
 naturally sweetened but on everyone 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.610
 if it is sweetened that means yes already 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.260
 three times where it gets and thereby 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.610
 a super yummy taste by her 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.900
 In any case, you will find a pro's 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.630
 Great alternative to the classic ones 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.570
 Oatmeal recipes but also my 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.740
