00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.170 
weird situation where there's not much
time<00:02:11.290> left<00:02:11.349> on<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.739> clock<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.670> accidentally

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
time left on the clock you accidentally

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.559 
time left on the clock you accidentally
hit<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> submission<00:02:13.900> or

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
hit a submission or

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.330 
hit a submission or
yeah<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> actually<00:02:16.409> click<00:02:16.620> submission<00:02:17.159> we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
yeah you actually click submission we

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.599 
yeah you actually click submission we
didn't<00:02:17.670> need<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.379> didn't<00:02:19.379> mean<00:02:19.499> to<00:02:19.739> then<00:02:20.159> it's

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
didn't need to didn't mean to then it's

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.849 
didn't need to didn't mean to then it's
good<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:20.999> just<00:02:21.030> not<00:02:21.359> even<00:02:21.540> attempt<00:02:22.200> because

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
good to just not even attempt because

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.149 
good to just not even attempt because
then<00:02:23.219> you'll<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.519> out<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.879> faster<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.159> be

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
then you'll get out of it faster and be

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.089 
then you'll get out of it faster and be
able<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:27.109> inflict<00:02:28.109> more<00:02:28.319> damage<00:02:28.379> before<00:02:28.859> the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
able to inflict more damage before the

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.949 
able to inflict more damage before the
time<00:02:29.310> runs<00:02:29.340> out<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.480> submissions

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
time runs out because submissions

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.539 
time runs out because submissions
actually<00:02:31.439> use<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> lot<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:34.129> waste<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.340> lot<00:02:35.489> of

so you got to be careful but you know

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.140 
so you got to be careful but you know
also<00:03:31.409> what<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.919> does<00:03:32.129> is<00:03:32.340> when<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.549> dash<00:03:32.849> in

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
also what it does is when you dash in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.999 
also what it does is when you dash in
like<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.599> stop<00:03:34.049> sometimes<00:03:34.680> you'll<00:03:34.859> get

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
like that and stop sometimes you'll get

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.770 
like that and stop sometimes you'll get
them<00:03:35.099> to<00:03:35.280> throw<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> head<00:03:35.790> kick<00:03:36.030> or<00:03:36.299> like<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.449> big

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
strike and then you know it leaves them

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.599 
strike and then you know it leaves them
open<00:03:39.329> for<00:03:39.509> a<00:03:39.540> counter<00:03:39.900> after<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.549> a

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
open for a counter after that so it's a

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.729 
open for a counter after that so it's a
really<00:03:41.759> good<00:03:41.970> tip<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.299> do<00:03:42.419> that<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:43.650> know

coming to an end i'm trying to get the
sweep<00:04:00.870> from<00:04:01.139> guard<00:04:01.469> but<00:04:02.159> he<00:04:02.400> does<00:04:02.579> not<00:04:02.969> have

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
sweep from guard but he does not have

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.449 
sweep from guard but he does not have
any<00:04:03.780> he<00:04:04.290> actually<00:04:04.439> did<00:04:04.650> another<00:04:04.919> smart<00:04:05.280> move

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
any he actually did another smart move

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.039 
any he actually did another smart move
there<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.819> actually<00:04:05.969> just<00:04:06.329> got<00:04:06.540> up<00:04:06.810> out<00:04:07.019> of

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
there and actually just got up out of

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.420 
there and actually just got up out of
guard<00:04:07.379> because<00:04:07.620> he<00:04:07.829> knew<00:04:07.979> he<00:04:08.009> was<00:04:08.189> about<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
guard because he knew he was about to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.759 
guard because he knew he was about to
get<00:04:08.639> swept<00:04:09.019> because<00:04:10.019> he<00:04:10.139> had<00:04:10.259> already<00:04:10.409> blocked

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
get swept because he had already blocked

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.979 
get swept because he had already blocked
a<00:04:10.979> couple<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.400> my<00:04:11.639> sweeps<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.689> next<00:04:12.870> one

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
a couple of my sweeps so the next one

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.020 
a couple of my sweeps so the next one
would<00:04:13.259> automatically<00:04:13.769> go<00:04:13.949> through<00:04:14.310> really

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
would automatically go through really

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.360 
would automatically go through really
smart<00:04:15.359> move<00:04:15.509> by<00:04:15.719> him<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.169> just<00:04:16.409> realize<00:04:17.099> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
smart move by him to just realize that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.060 
smart move by him to just realize that
and<00:04:17.579> then<00:04:17.729> stand<00:04:18.090> up<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.349> get<00:04:19.590> put<00:04:19.769> in<00:04:19.919> a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
