00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
you want to view it you would use

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.169 
you want to view it you would use
anaglyph<00:02:03.560> glasses<00:02:03.610> which<00:02:04.610> are<00:02:04.820> your<00:02:04.970> typical

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
anaglyph glasses which are your typical

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.660 
anaglyph glasses which are your typical
red<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.750> blue<00:02:05.929> 3d<00:02:06.380> glasses<00:02:06.619> that's<00:02:07.460> how<00:02:07.640> you

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
red and blue 3d glasses that's how you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.339 
red and blue 3d glasses that's how you
would<00:02:07.850> do<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:08.240> you're<00:02:08.360> viewing<00:02:08.720> content<00:02:08.959> on

would do it if you're viewing content on

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.050 
would do it if you're viewing content on
the<00:02:09.470> device<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.459> what<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.640> would<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.030> you

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
the device so what you would do is you

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.350 
the device so what you would do is you
go<00:02:11.300> into<00:02:11.510> 3d<00:02:11.810> camcorder<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.240> can

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
go into 3d camcorder here and as you can

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.790 
go into 3d camcorder here and as you can
see<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.630> got<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.900> red<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.290> blue<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.650> can

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
would use to record with anaglyph which

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.680 
would use to record with anaglyph which
is<00:02:21.530> those<00:02:21.680> red<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.040> blue<00:02:22.190> glasses<00:02:22.489> now<00:02:23.480> i<00:02:23.510> can
