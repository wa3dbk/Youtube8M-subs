00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.000
 alice she turns cercone how are you 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.410
 you listen to me I'll get upset 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.299
 come end up today for a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 any new video on ssx then this 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.150
 video it's a little glitch france part 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.039
 slips but it's rather a fault 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.619
 a bug that I managed to find this bug 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.670
 In particular, it will enable the challenge 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.320
 stratosphere so it's entitled to stay 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.840
 in the air 8 seconds without deploying any 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 wingsuit so there is a hard archi challenge to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 frankly I managed to do it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 that thanks to this guide is as solid 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 allows in particular to achieve a lot of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.160
 challenges with the number of rotations sees 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.960
 the number of cops 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.250
 so here is so to start you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 go into exploration mode so in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 patagonia which is a country that is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.579
 located in the south of Argentina you go 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 on the syro polish summit so that is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.890
 the top of the first tracks and you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 go on the track black boxes in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 version trick car version worse it does not 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.270
 will not walk you take the character 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.760
 of your choice it does not matter 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.469
 but it is necessary at all costs to equip it with 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.239
 wingsuit that's me I took mac because 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.739
 that it's my character over the top 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.840
 level is the character that I arrive 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 to play better with patrick francis 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 terrade just a trick mersey caychac fr 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.880
 if they take this video bah it's not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.229
 a glitch but it's still terrible 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.610
 and a little trick we see there a big 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 thank you to them and to all who live and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 they will see this video on my channel 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.140
 do not hesitate to really stay up 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.049
 the end of the video because you will see 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 the mounting trailer that will come out very 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 soon so there is a montage of me at 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.580
 ski so I would say irl benefit you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.150
 trailer he still sends steak 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.619
 cellar fries 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.570
 here I am cutting and because for the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.799
 flu each and do that I do not think 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 that these subscribers store interests but for 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.170
 you but at my age since that you 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.670
 so interested in seeing skiing then 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.780
 do not hesitate to stay until the end of the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.009
 video if you see it on my channel 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.079
 while mobile chatelaine with my 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.759
 micro is so a site shoot you down at 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 start you will absolutely start the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.299
 track of quite normally you 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.470
 do you say or do your jumps and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080
 as you can see for those 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.070
 who silas very boring music 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.630
 who repeats at home why she 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.740
 done all the time here and for those who 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.870
 do not know this quarter yet 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.730
 and 6 we will see on the left there 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.900
 a counter with good the number of 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.250
 seconds at the end of the half that you 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.110
 have spent apart the track then 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.110
 kilometers long and the number of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.800
 meters remaining and well in fact 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.000
 do you really focus on a number of 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.680
 meters remaining because there we can 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.920
 find out I'm at 2000 and a few 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.930
 remaining meters and the glitch is located at 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.620
 1590 m remaining so that's it's a 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.330
 trick to remember 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.920
 just one thing all the ways 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.840
 join the guide good ben there if you 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.980
 go left it's okay I 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.510
 gone right because I'm used to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.130
 to go right but otherwise all 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 paths rejects at the beach you will see 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.000
 we will soon see a bar of 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.260
 grind and if to accumulate a maximum of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.760
 blues frankly before you get there 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.440
 you see I do not have that much 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.880
 just a few small goose but that's it 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.160
 alas the seed bar that we are going 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.530
 to appear to arrive on you 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.910
 booster you jump and you deploy your 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.350
 your city ​​and wish you go to 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.030
 right that you spent before or after 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.530
 the rock does not change anything and there you 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.810
 go back to the territories of 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.910
 che and watch that you jump look 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.230
 me this size of bustos and just 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.880
 then you will see the time that we 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.140
 can stay in the air and especially the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.640
 number of flip we're going to do the number 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.739
 of points we will do tomorrow already at 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 21 flip it's a sick thing 12 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.610
 seconds and kalou at 12 seconds and a half 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.100
 pretty much it's still pretty huge 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.239
 I wanted to spend that for good I you 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.890
 go back the way here for those who 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.300
 have not understood very well that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.380
 the way if you pass in accelerated 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.300
 obvious because it's still pretty 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.980
 long and boring enough but as I dedicate 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.150
 no matter frankly the way 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.560
 you took what - I started 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.550
 says if I go left is that it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.050
 will change something if I go to 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.580
 right or what and not actually it does not 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.750
 change absolutely nothing but a council 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.220
 go right because it's easier to 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.660
 to heat the bar of a seed there are 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.170
 little boost before so it's a little 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.580
 easier 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.980
 so that's what allows him to stay 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.540
 about 11-12 seconds in the air 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.530
 you will also see the number of 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.610
 points I'm going to do there is when 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.980
 even very very impressive 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.870
 I will go from a million points to 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.250
 3 million recording a jump so 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.620
 imagine yourself if you are a trick a 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.700
 super sort that with a boost times wines 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.350
 purposes and a huge thing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.850
 look at the room actually frankly you 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.810
 go before the rock or learned that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.530
 does not matter 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.340
 and there you jump and it's magic 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.140
 frankly it is not very hard to 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.100
 take in a glitch at the beginning a little 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.239
 little because they strip the wto 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.440
 well turn right 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.330
 but otherwise frankly it's a glitch 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.890
 rather simple servant it's nice and 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.100
 I really liked what's going on 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.480
 still not bad served 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.280
 I hope it will serve you just as much 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.900
 and I hope you will understand because 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.250
 that as I already told you for 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.320
 explain the glitchs me I'm not 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.790
 super good I 'm super talented you explained 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.410
 prefered commented videos normally 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.360
 but I like it anyway I do 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.500
 share my knowledge here thanks to you 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.270
