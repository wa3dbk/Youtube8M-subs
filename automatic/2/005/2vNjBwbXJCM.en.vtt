rank<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.069> like<00:03:05.780> dad<00:03:06.780> probably<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:08.040> drank

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
up a whole level and probably around 20

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.740 
up a whole level and probably around 20
seconds<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.739> it's<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.790> mental<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.569> guy

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
seconds so it's just mental this is guy

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.410 
seconds so it's just mental this is guy
so<00:03:13.019> make<00:03:13.200> sure<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.920> do<00:03:14.100> give<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.580> try<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
so make sure you do give this a try to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.930 
so make sure you do give this a try to
get<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.080> rank<00:03:16.530> 50<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.040> you're<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.340> already<00:03:17.519> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
get to rank 50 if you're not already and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.199 
get to rank 50 if you're not already and
that<00:03:18.060> will<00:03:18.180> gain<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.769> think<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.950> 30<00:03:20.310> g<00:03:20.730> OT<00:03:20.850> one

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
