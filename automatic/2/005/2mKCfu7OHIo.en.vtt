00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
earlier movie I set this document up

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
earlier movie I set this document up
with<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> primary<00:00:30.449> text<00:00:31.080> frame<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.859> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
with a primary text frame now if you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.660 
with a primary text frame now if you
have<00:00:32.340> InDesign<00:00:33.120> cs4<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.020> 5<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:35.100> did<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.460> have

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
have InDesign cs4 or 5 you did not have

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
have InDesign cs4 or 5 you did not have
the<00:00:35.820> option<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> choosing<00:00:36.630> primary<00:00:37.350> text

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the option of choosing primary text

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
the option of choosing primary text
frame<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.280> what<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.670> called<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.910> master

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
frame you had what was called a master

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
frame you had what was called a master
text<00:00:39.719> frame<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> behaved<00:00:40.800> somewhat

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
text frame but that behaved somewhat

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
text frame but that behaved somewhat
differently<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:43.110> show<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440

differently so I'm gonna also show you
how<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:45.050> autoflow<00:00:46.079> place<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.129> does

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
how we can do a autoflow place that does

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790 
how we can do a autoflow place that does
not<00:00:47.610> use<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.120> primary<00:00:48.539> text<00:00:48.870> frame<00:00:49.050> either<00:00:49.410> way

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
have in this case 87 pages you may have

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.880 
have in this case 87 pages you may have
a<00:01:57.240> slightly<00:01:57.570> different<00:01:57.780> number<00:01:58.170> because

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a slightly different number because

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
a slightly different number because
maybe<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.850> didn't<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> missing<00:02:00.780> font

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.929 
maybe you didn't have a missing font
maybe<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.740> had<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> different<00:02:02.310> default<00:02:02.670> font

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
maybe you had a different default font

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.850 
maybe you had a different default font
it<00:02:03.360> doesn't<00:02:03.719> matter<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.110> point<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.710> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it doesn't matter at this point just so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
it doesn't matter at this point just so
long<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.329> okay<00:02:06.930> now<00:02:07.110> I'm

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
long as it's all in there okay now I'm

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.089 
long as it's all in there okay now I'm
gonna<00:02:07.469> undo<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.759> press<00:02:09.420> command<00:02:09.690> Z<00:02:10.410> twice

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
gonna undo that press command Z twice

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.910 
gonna undo that press command Z twice
and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.480> gonna<00:02:12.599> delete<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.349> primary

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and then I'm gonna delete that primary

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
and then I'm gonna delete that primary
tax-free<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.270> let's<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.200> would<00:02:16.319> happen

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
tax-free so let's see what would happen

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.620 
tax-free so let's see what would happen
if<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.069> didn't<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> primary<00:02:18.270> tax<00:02:18.660> rate<00:02:23.630> if

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
if we didn't have a primary tax rate if

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.150 
if we didn't have a primary tax rate if
I<00:02:25.470> click<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.360> get<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.720> one<00:02:28.170> text<00:02:28.739> frame<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
I click I get just one text frame and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.850 
I click I get just one text frame and
then<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.610> stops<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.600> over<00:02:31.080> set<00:02:31.290> text

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
then it stops and I have over set text

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.699 
then it stops and I have over set text
so<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.489> need<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.930> flow<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.620> my

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
so what I need to do to flow all of my

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.340
