we<00:00:30.960> were<00:00:31.080> working<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.439> Katya<00:00:31.800> blini<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> I

we were working with Katya blini and I

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
we were working with Katya blini and I
think<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> inspiration<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> name<00:00:34.530> was

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
think the inspiration for the name was

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.459 
think the inspiration for the name was
partly<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> stood<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.870> vertical

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
partly what it stood for vertical

are highly dynamic and then we have

are highly dynamic and then we have
places<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.520> our<00:01:03.030> landscape<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.260> rooms<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.920> the

functions<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.490> thought<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.729> lot<00:01:08.970> about

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
functions we really thought a lot about

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
functions we really thought a lot about
the<00:01:10.380> change<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.010> experiences<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> move

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the change that you experiences you move

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.510 
the change that you experiences you move
from<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> type<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> space<00:01:13.130> into<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> more

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
from that type of space into a more

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670 
from that type of space into a more
purposeful<00:01:15.000> space<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.170> thinking<00:01:16.500> about

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
purposeful space you know thinking about

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.020 
purposeful space you know thinking about
how<00:01:17.710> does<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.860> feel<00:01:18.070> differently<00:01:18.550> when<00:01:18.880> you're

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
how does it feel differently when you're

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.540 
how does it feel differently when you're
inside<00:01:19.990> what's<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.740> experience<00:01:21.160> as<00:01:21.400> you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
inside what's the experience as you

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.750 
inside what's the experience as you
cross<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.880> threshold<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:23.620> what's<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.490> sense

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
cross the threshold and what's the sense

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.150 
cross the threshold and what's the sense
that<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.300> about<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.870> other<00:01:26.020> space<00:01:26.380> you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
that you have about the other space you

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.910 
that you have about the other space you
know<00:01:27.280> from<00:01:27.610> either<00:01:27.760> inside<00:01:28.210> or<00:01:28.270> outside<00:01:28.920> when
