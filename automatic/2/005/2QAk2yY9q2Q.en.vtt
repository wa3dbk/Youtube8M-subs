00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.249
 yes essentially this portal Victor point over me 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.019
 Name is Yaroslav and today we talk 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.919
 About mandrogi this already guessed and name 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.539
 I recently showed 4 2 on that 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.710
 that is not entirely true 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.689
 obviously company 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.579
 and you are the reason to lower the policy on all 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.519
 lines that are 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.019
 The whole rollers of me is that Kiev is not all 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.089
 innovation that is 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.819
 in the normal version having formed the hand of the Kremlin 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:31.789
 18 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.270
 thank you good man by name 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.910
 the pains 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 The start of the guns is already at 4.2 and we'll see everything 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.960
 what changes there writes what is the difference 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.210
 between the tablet version and the difference is 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.060
 let's go the first thing now on bail 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.480
 fiddle and kirov just 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.290
 turbulence when all the same got to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 China's current kg 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.680
 such work is underway 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.150
 if spaces are slovakian weddings we 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.970
 try the camera but talk to them 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.100
 later on 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.050
 just like in the Ob fire a problem 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.260
 which I didnâ€™t let me do 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 Russia and the EU see here the actual clock 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.740
 that is, moscow and paris which 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.630
 areas question in an hour how to see them about 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 than just could down 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.340
 and attracts quite what I wanted not 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.720
 Has gone has entailed is all Odessa masks 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.330
 valid your calendar but or ball if this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.320
 something else to add 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.620
 demanded of him but i don't care what 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.300
 the future 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.860
 will be added to all 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 Petrov who has a Treasury here 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.640
 says on the system 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.750
 i'm totally sorry for this camera 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 boot and be back 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.410
 sleep in the right practice 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.520
 cameras will now highlight like this if we want 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.590
 got the setting just clamped 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.179
 and I see the settings for Putin feel 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.930
 court outbreak included 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.270
 or I want to deploy to the camera 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.880
 which is also not a problem 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 or else else reverse the reverse 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.310
 you can change everything in such moments 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.510
 settings that were not previously 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.670
 left now they give out like this 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.340
 and you can change the whole white balance 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.570
 search of course offset is more detailed then 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.859
 there is 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.669
 if all the same autoradio among 

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:03.460
 photo size and so on 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.400
 Avt in the forest several new points more precisely 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.929
 one is the photosphere 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.169
 then the photosphere work 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.829
 thus becoming trialman 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.400
 focus on the point we start to carry the camera 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.509
 we need a side we donâ€™t really do it 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.259
 we will because the process is very 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.739
 long unfortunately 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.499
 and now just show you a snapshot 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.139
 which we have already done 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.469
 under which you can already see four 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.229
 gallery 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.469
 regarding lyric 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.140
 them here we have cameras 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.030
 and that's essentially the photosphere are placed 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.759
 in the center is such an icon 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.149
 where we can evaluate the method posted method 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.099
 Akims 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.299
 world place with not very comfortable 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.409
 we can do it like this 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:46.729
 and actually 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.389
 the judge then such things for example do something 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.539
 it will be incomprehensible students i don't know with 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.969
 what is the nose explain participating 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:54.749
 cool 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.969
 whatever we can prince reverse predator 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.289
 it's all clear otherwise co-editor to watch 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.729
 we will not be no different from that 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:02.929
 what is not quite so 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.029
 and here in Paris the photosphere is 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.299
 we'll see how it looks like shopping 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.019
 opens and we can finger 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:09.949
 chase yahoo 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.829
 where we want to look 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.089
 completely place the jar ax then 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.869
 gone draw and not use 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:18.930
 tripod nothing covered like monkey da vinci 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.359
 not really trying 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.680
 Dmitriev account is not bad yet he is stupid east 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.169
 shield 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.019
 corroded 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.389
 0 this is not a problem what we have here 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.249
 stadium Chernomorets suddenly became curve 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.469
 but in general, but in fact it is enough 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.139
 not bad with something into what 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.049
 nothing like in the Kiev community 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.079
 drains never happened 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.089
 Assessment to warm the last changes 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.939
 which surprised me not discussed question 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.859
 how will I pull Nikishin 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:46.840
 center because their 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.519
 if in the usual sweet after 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.189
 successful trading but hardly would you do 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.429
 all the same will be decided like this 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:54.869
 and push and trial comes across 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:55.809
 graduates 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.019
 either you do like this the buyer doesn't 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:58.889
 right away 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.919
 it is quite convenient that is, they went around 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.089
 document 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.009
 20 m pulled out the rest 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.199
 update but now we can not just 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 Tass replaceable and then follow center 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.049
 in general, what has befallen me 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.869
 because I just almost found the curve 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:14.159
 but 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.629
 all over russian 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.120
 here works with you 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.629
 but I want to write words 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.159
 suppose english wedding 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.429
 then why there they work where they i'm not 

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:26.969
 I know why they go 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.899
 David will tell in the comments why 

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:29.580
 does not work 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.629
 a couple more changes which I did not say 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.419
 when telling the collapse 4 2 on if he doesn't 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.020
 altogether 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.039
 Siberians applications 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.990
 no cock applications 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.919
 if go security 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.319
 here below in addition to the icon button and bottom 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.629
 unknown sources when we on 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:48.550
 she was pressed 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.849
 now we are not inferior weed application thousand 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.009
 today sub-index nancy spending plus more 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.550
 inform check applications customers 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.089
 can positions that can inflict 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.360
 device damage rewrite they then 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.689
 there is a theory now vondra whether 4 2 there 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.770
 semblance of a pair of goals of the virus 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.779
 Which can 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:04.960
 in understand 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.100
 Who will be Tomsk Lopez with techner and 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.360
 a position which amazonas 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.689
 evenings when you 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.830
 print kakuta cite hop help hidden 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.599
 dreams of becoming paid senate 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.809
 in year 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:16.449
 but in general, all the guys 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.469
 no more changes as far as I know 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.409
 so today we looked at another 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.929
 a couple of changes to vondroy 4.2 not all people 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:25.800
 were perfect nevertheless the focus 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.449
 hitting the first one was just very cool 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.110
 and I think that the most important thing 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.909
 the pressure that is 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.520
 to date 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.639
 Vondra case and the last thing he wants 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.900
 say about today us 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.389
 rewards the junction 5 degrees and i 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.340
 resolutely leaving here because of 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.349
 polish cold 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.759
 subscribe to the channel somewhere here 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.089
 light sweet supplies 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.249
 boys I'm running away 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.279
 and even more so 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.410
 ha ha ha ha 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.479
 k.k. 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.360
 moreover, as the director said 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.630
 on weekend advertising any 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.650
 important
