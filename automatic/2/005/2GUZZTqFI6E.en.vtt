has definitely been a mixed bag the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.710 
has definitely been a mixed bag the
northern<00:00:16.849> half<00:00:17.029> of<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:17.270> state<00:00:17.330> of<00:00:17.540> the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
northern half of the state of the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.300 
northern half of the state of the
northeast<00:00:18.110> of<00:00:18.170> porush<00:00:18.590> portion<00:00:19.010> of<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.160> state

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
northeast of porush portion of the state

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.070 
northeast of porush portion of the state
has<00:00:19.369> definitely<00:00:19.790> produced<00:00:20.090> a<00:00:20.270> far<00:00:20.630> more<00:00:20.810> fish

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
has definitely produced a far more fish

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.810 
has definitely produced a far more fish
than<00:00:21.110> what<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.590> southeastern<00:00:22.190> half<00:00:22.400> has

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
than what the southeastern half has

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.279 
than what the southeastern half has
really<00:00:23.300> done<00:00:23.420> and<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.660> think<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:23.990> really

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
really done and I think it really

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.960 
really done and I think it really
relates<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.279> weather<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:25.640> we've<00:00:25.820> been

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
relates to the weather that we've been

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.040 
relates to the weather that we've been
seeing<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.240> lot<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.420> storms<00:00:26.779> across<00:00:26.960> the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
seeing a lot of storms across the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.840 
seeing a lot of storms across the
southeast<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.220> east<00:00:28.310> central<00:00:28.580> part<00:00:28.820> of

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
southeast and the east central part of

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.890 
southeast and the east central part of
the<00:00:28.910> state<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.420> I<00:00:29.510> think<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:29.869> definitely

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
the state and I think that definitely

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.350 
the state and I think that definitely
has<00:00:30.560> affected<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.130> bike<00:00:31.310> as<00:00:31.970> far<00:00:32.210> as<00:00:32.269> the

folks<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> crappie<00:02:13.780> bite<00:02:14.019> has<00:02:14.110> definitely

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
folks the crappie bite has definitely

folks the crappie bite has definitely
tapered<00:02:14.890> off<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.040> most<00:02:15.459> areas<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.000> again<00:02:16.330> I
