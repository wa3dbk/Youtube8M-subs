00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.399 
that shut and you throw the whole unit
and<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> bin<00:01:41.780> whereas<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> other<00:01:42.930> unit<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and the bin whereas the other unit of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.609 
and the bin whereas the other unit of
course<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> reusable<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> two

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
course is reusable so that's the two

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.530 
course is reusable so that's the two
traps<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.220> four<00:01:47.399> thirty<00:01:47.579> dollars<00:01:47.909> rescue<00:01:48.329> fly

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
traps to four thirty dollars rescue fly

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.980 
traps to four thirty dollars rescue fly
trap<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.960> Eau<00:01:49.079> de<00:01:49.259> red

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
trap at Eau de red

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.289 
trap at Eau de red
Denzil<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.920> Flies<00:01:52.159> there<00:01:52.490> proves<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.060> works

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
Denzil the Flies there proves it works

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.320 
Denzil the Flies there proves it works
and<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.509> reusable<00:01:56.509> trap<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:57.079> here

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and to the reusable trap over here

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.030 
and to the reusable trap over here
zooming<00:01:59.330> there<00:01:59.540> bunny<00:02:00.170> applies<00:02:00.530> here<00:02:00.770> as<00:02:00.830> well

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
zooming there bunny applies here as well

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.550 
zooming there bunny applies here as well
so<00:02:01.640> two<00:02:01.729> great<00:02:02.149> fly<00:02:02.390> traps<00:02:02.689> at<00:02:02.960> odor<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.350> user

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so two great fly traps at odor and user

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.100 
so two great fly traps at odor and user
on<00:02:03.770> them<00:02:03.920> too
