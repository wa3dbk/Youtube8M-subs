you<00:01:25.710> know<00:01:25.800> people<00:01:25.980> people<00:01:26.400> gather<00:01:26.700> here

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you know people people gather here

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
you know people people gather here
during<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.870> day<00:01:28.050> and<00:01:28.620> we<00:01:29.010> had<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.250> figure<00:01:29.400> out

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
during the day and we had to figure out

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
during the day and we had to figure out
where<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.060> pieces<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.450> also<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:31.230> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
where to put the pieces but also kind of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.640 
where to put the pieces but also kind of
where<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.470> put<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> moss<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.510> when<00:01:34.410> we<00:01:34.440> got

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
where to put the moss so we when we got

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
where to put the moss so we when we got
here<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:34.980> just<00:01:35.370> basically<00:01:35.460> followed<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
here we just basically followed the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
here we just basically followed the
track<00:01:36.480> of<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.720> Sun<00:01:36.960> pieces<00:01:37.800> like<00:01:37.950> really

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
track of the Sun pieces like really

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.100 
track of the Sun pieces like really
exposed<00:01:38.760> between<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.660> like<00:01:40.440> 11<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
exposed between about like 11 and and

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.970 
exposed between about like 11 and and
three<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
three you know this is a this is the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.320 
three you know this is a this is the
chair<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:49.010> like<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.910> can<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
chair here like that you can kind of

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.760 
chair here like that you can kind of
lounge<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:55.530> might<00:01:55.740> be

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
lounge on this here is a this might be

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.760 
lounge on this here is a this might be
one<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> more<00:01:56.370> comfortable<00:01:56.880> spots

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
one of the more comfortable spots

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.490 
one of the more comfortable spots
actually<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.340> lean<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.380> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
actually you can lean on this and you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500 
actually you can lean on this and you
can<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:02.010> just<00:02:02.070> put<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.730> head<00:02:02.910> back<00:02:03.120> and

can kind of just put your head back and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.600 
can kind of just put your head back and
I'll<00:02:04.440> I<00:02:04.470> just<00:02:04.710> sort<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.890> relax<00:02:05.220> there<00:02:05.460> which

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
I'll I just sort of relax there which

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.480 
I'll I just sort of relax there which
we've<00:02:05.790> been<00:02:05.910> doing<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.210> lot<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
we've been doing a lot of this is one of

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.250 
we've been doing a lot of this is one of
the<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.700> complex<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.690> pieces<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.200> we

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
the more complex kind of pieces and we

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.699 
the more complex kind of pieces and we
call<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.150> fractal<00:02:12.150> wrap<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.470> basically

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
call this the fractal wrap and basically

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.410 
call this the fractal wrap and basically
well<00:02:16.709> take<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> while<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.430> kind<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> explain

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
well take a while to kind of explain

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.699 
well take a while to kind of explain
what<00:02:18.660> went<00:02:18.810> behind<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.230> but<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.590> it's

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
what went behind it but but it's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.310 
what went behind it but but it's
basically<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.520> big<00:02:21.150> lounge<00:02:21.420> chair<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> it's

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320

the<00:02:53.260> entire<00:02:53.500> project<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.040> camp<00:02:54.220> revolves

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the entire project of the camp revolves

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.660 
the entire project of the camp revolves
kind<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.560> starts<00:02:56.800> with<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.950> idea<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.340> growth

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
kind of starts with the idea of growth

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.840 
kind of starts with the idea of growth
the<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.810> crystal<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.290> peace<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.710> the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the the crystal and peace is the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
architectural or kind of design design

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.230 
architectural or kind of design design
objects<00:03:03.960> are<00:03:04.960> structured<00:03:05.880> through<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> kind<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
objects are structured through a kind of

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.000 
objects are structured through a kind of
an<00:03:07.330> idea<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.900> Krista<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.560> crystalline

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
an idea of a Krista of a crystalline

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.940 
an idea of a Krista of a crystalline
growth<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:11.200> have<00:03:11.350> we<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.710> kind<00:03:11.890> of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
growth so that we have we have kind of
