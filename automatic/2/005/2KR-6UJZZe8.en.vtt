could also do this by hand that will

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
could also do this by hand that will
work<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.080> well<00:01:19.370> or<00:01:20.370> if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.910> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.120> really

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
wide elastic like this one is not wide

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.250 
wide elastic like this one is not wide
enough<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.060> you've<00:01:24.180> even<00:01:24.480> wider<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
enough but if you've even wider you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.860 
enough but if you've even wider you
could<00:01:25.410> just<00:01:25.590> fold<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.280> half<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.940> then<00:01:27.480> sew

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
could just fold in half and then sew

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.600 
could just fold in half and then sew
just<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.530> side<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.160> you're<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.370> hair

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
just the one side and then you're a hair

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270 
just the one side and then you're a hair
scrunchie<00:01:29.760> would<00:01:30.300> be<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.580 

so<00:01:34.280> when<00:01:34.490> you're<00:01:34.610> sewing<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.480> sides<00:01:35.780> make

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
so when you're sewing on the sides make

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.770 
so when you're sewing on the sides make
sure<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.160> don't<00:01:37.460> sew<00:01:38.240> all<00:01:38.480> the<00:01:38.510> way<00:01:38.660> to

open this and let's see there's a tube

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.270 
open this and let's see there's a tube
right<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.330> we<00:02:05.450> take<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> two<00:02:05.900> ends<00:02:06.170> right<00:02:07.040> and

right so we take the two ends right and
make<00:02:07.400> sure<00:02:07.550> that<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:07.880> loop<00:02:08.090> isn't<00:02:08.450> twisted

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
make sure that your loop isn't twisted

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
lost it so what you two do is you take

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.270 
lost it so what you two do is you take
open<00:02:16.160> it<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:18.020> just<00:02:18.170> want<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.350> show<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.070> the

two<00:02:19.520> inner<00:02:19.760> ones<00:02:20.150> together<00:02:20.690> not<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:20.989> outer

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
two inner ones together not the outer

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.370 
two inner ones together not the outer
one<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.890> other<00:02:22.010> still<00:02:22.459> will<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.790> hole<00:02:23.380> so

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
one so the other still will be a hole so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.040 
one so the other still will be a hole so
now<00:02:24.410> we<00:02:24.590> have<00:02:24.770> our<00:02:24.800> tube<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.630> here's<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
now we have our tube and so here's the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.650 
now we have our tube and so here's the
opening<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.650> okay<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.610> take<00:02:28.910> your<00:02:29.030> elastic

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
opening right okay so take your elastic

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.330 
opening right okay so take your elastic
so<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.380> can<00:02:30.560> pretend<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.130> one

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
so you can pretend that this is one

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
so you can pretend that this is one
piece<00:02:31.610> -<00:02:31.850> double<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.750> make<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:32.930> stronger

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
piece - double just to make it stronger

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.750 
piece - double just to make it stronger
so<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.920> put<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> safety<00:02:34.520> pin<00:02:35.920> okay<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.459> take<00:02:37.610> it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
so you put a safety pin okay you take it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.550 
so you put a safety pin okay you take it
inside<00:02:42.400> hey<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.030> fish<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.360> through<00:02:44.840> at

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
inside hey you just fish it through at

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.140 
inside hey you just fish it through at
the<00:02:45.680> moment<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.070> you<00:02:46.580> don't<00:02:46.760> want<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.940> fish<00:02:47.060> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
the moment you you don't want to fish it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.979 
the moment you you don't want to fish it
all<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.330> way<00:02:47.420> through<00:02:47.450> because<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
all the way through because then you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.060 
all the way through because then you
just<00:02:48.019> bring<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.380> all<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.500> way<00:02:48.590> around<00:02:48.709> and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
just bring it all the way around and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.259 
just bring it all the way around and
then<00:02:49.160> they'll<00:02:49.310> be<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> waste<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:50.180> like

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
then they'll be a waste it's like

then they'll be a waste it's like
driving<00:02:50.540> your<00:02:50.720> car<00:02:50.900> through<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.110> tunnel<00:02:51.380> you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
driving your car through the tunnel you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.600 
driving your car through the tunnel you
come<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.739> other<00:02:51.860> end<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> want<00:02:52.519> us

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
keep it keep the end here so you just

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.890 
keep it keep the end here so you just
use<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> pin<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.940> now<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.299> won't<00:02:59.450> move<00:02:59.660> so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
use a pin see now that won't move so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.070 
use a pin see now that won't move so
they'll<00:03:00.019> say<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.320> opening<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.070> now<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:02.720> fish

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
they'll say the opening and now we fish

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.110 
they'll say the opening and now we fish
fish<00:03:03.320> fish<00:03:03.350> fish<00:03:03.590> okay<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.340> once<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.790> fish

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
fish fish fish okay so once you fish

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.570 
fish fish fish okay so once you fish
your<00:03:05.390> last<00:03:05.690> leg<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:06.080> pull<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.920> sand<00:03:07.160> out<00:03:07.340> and

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
your last leg out pull the sand out and

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.039 
your last leg out pull the sand out and
you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.850> undo<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.239> pin<00:03:08.450> make<00:03:08.690> sure<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.930> hold

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
you can undo the pin make sure you hold

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.509 
you can undo the pin make sure you hold
the<00:03:09.200> elastic<00:03:09.560> because<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:09.920> undo<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.340> pin

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
the elastic because if you undo the pin

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.280 
the elastic because if you undo the pin
and<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.850> just<00:03:11.000> let<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.209> well<00:03:11.630> you'll<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.230> to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and you just let go well you'll have to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.810 
and you just let go well you'll have to
fish<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.739> again<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.220> pull<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.549> part

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
fish that again so you pull this part

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.650 
fish that again so you pull this part
out<00:03:15.040> okay<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.519> take<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.820> safety<00:03:17.000> pin<00:03:17.239> off

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.660 

okay<00:03:20.690> now<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.170> part<00:03:21.500> since<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.160> elastic<00:03:22.549> is

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
okay now this part since the elastic is

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.830 
okay now this part since the elastic is
quite<00:03:22.910> thick<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.920> can<00:03:24.980> be<00:03:25.250> difficult<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.840> just

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
quite thick it can be difficult to just

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810 
quite thick it can be difficult to just
sew<00:03:27.019> with<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.320> machine<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.280> we<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.730> do

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
sew with the machine so we have to do

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.550 
sew with the machine so we have to do
some<00:03:29.000> hand<00:03:29.180> sewing<00:03:29.360> yeah<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.019> know<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.380> sucks

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
some hand sewing yeah I know it sucks

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.259 
some hand sewing yeah I know it sucks
okay<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:33.140> we're<00:03:33.260> just<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.269> Hansol

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
okay so so we're just going to Hansol

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.319 
okay so so we're just going to Hansol
the<00:03:35.390> edges<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.440> ends<00:03:36.799> together<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:38.180> don't

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
the edges the ends together you don't

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.940 
the edges the ends together you don't
need<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.570> many<00:03:38.720> stitches<00:03:39.170> just<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.560> few<00:03:39.799> just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
need that many stitches just a few just

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.500 
need that many stitches just a few just
to<00:03:40.100> hold<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.520> place<00:03:40.700> and<00:03:41.060> then<00:03:41.209> we're<00:03:41.390> going

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
to hold it in place and then we're going

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.930 
to hold it in place and then we're going
to<00:03:41.569> use<00:03:41.720> our<00:03:41.840> sewing<00:03:42.140> machine<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.830> zig<00:03:43.700> zag

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
to use our sewing machine and zig zag

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.820 
to use our sewing machine and zig zag
over<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.420> joint<00:03:45.020> area<00:03:45.530> just

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
over this joint area just

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.130 
over this joint area just
to<00:03:45.860> give<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.100> added<00:03:46.430> strength<00:03:46.820> okay<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:47.780> after

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
to give it added strength okay so after

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.370 
to give it added strength okay so after
you<00:03:48.320> finish<00:03:48.740> the<00:03:48.890> hand<00:03:49.130> sewing<00:03:50.020> so<00:03:51.020> let's<00:03:51.170> just

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
you finish the hand sewing so let's just

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.200 
you finish the hand sewing so let's just
face<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.620> down<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> little<00:03:52.250> bit<00:03:52.460> we're<00:03:53.060> going<00:03:53.150> to

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
face it down a little bit we're going to

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.820 
face it down a little bit we're going to
mix<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.810> pull<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:54.080> out<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.380> get<00:03:54.500> more<00:03:54.650> space

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
mix you pull this out to get more space

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.120 
mix you pull this out to get more space
place<00:03:55.610> it<00:03:55.760> underneath<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.210> machine<00:03:56.540> just

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
place it underneath the machine just

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.920 
place it underneath the machine just
with<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> zig<00:03:58.460> zag<00:03:58.490> stitch<00:03:58.700> after<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.600> Zig

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
with a zig zag stitch after you Zig

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.490 
with a zig zag stitch after you Zig
zagged

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
zagged

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.860 
zagged
around<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.610> elastic<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.300> strengthen<00:04:02.720> it

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
around the elastic just to strengthen it

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.130 
around the elastic just to strengthen it
so<00:04:03.320> we<00:04:03.410> want<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.680> close<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.220> hole<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.870> we<00:04:05.960> have

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
so we want to close the hole so we have

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.230 
so we want to close the hole so we have
this<00:04:06.260> opening<00:04:06.890> here<00:04:07.280> all<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.790> have<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.940> do<00:04:08.090> is

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
this opening here all you have to do is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240 
this opening here all you have to do is
just<00:04:08.390> fold<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.870> under<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.860> doesn't<00:04:10.130> really

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
just fold this under it doesn't really

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.890 
just fold this under it doesn't really
matter<00:04:10.610> how<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:10.880> do<00:04:11.210> it<00:04:11.330> actually<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> point

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
matter how you do it actually the point

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.710 
matter how you do it actually the point
is<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.350> close<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.860> hole<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:14.450> then<00:04:14.570> we're

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
is just to close the hole and then we're

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.030 
is just to close the hole and then we're
just<00:04:14.840> going<00:04:14.960> to<00:04:14.990> straight<00:04:15.320> stitch<00:04:15.350> right<00:04:15.890> or

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
just going to straight stitch right or

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.500 
just going to straight stitch right or
there's<00:04:16.370> another<00:04:16.519> variation<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.390> can

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
there's another variation that you can

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.539 
there's another variation that you can
do<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.680> first<00:04:18.920> one<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.220> we<00:04:19.310> made

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
do so this is the first one that we made

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.090 
do so this is the first one that we made
this<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.150> untwisted<00:04:20.780> version<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.380> this

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
this is the untwisted version and this

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.120 
this is the untwisted version and this
is<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.370> twisted<00:04:22.820> version<00:04:23.000> okay<00:04:23.890> so<00:04:24.890> it's<00:04:25.010> like

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
is the twisted version okay so it's like

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.700 
is the twisted version okay so it's like
all<00:04:25.370> round<00:04:25.790> away<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.810> make<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.200> twisted

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
all round away so to make the twisted

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.530 
all round away so to make the twisted
variation<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.550> just<00:04:28.790> exactly<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.300> sound

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
variation it's just exactly as a sound

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.360 
variation it's just exactly as a sound
it's<00:04:29.720> twisted<00:04:30.110> because<00:04:30.350> normally<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.250> would

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
it's twisted because normally you would

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.180 
it's twisted because normally you would
attach<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:33.020> complete<00:04:33.440> circle<00:04:33.950> see

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
attach this as a complete circle see

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.130 
attach this as a complete circle see
it's<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.400> complete<00:04:34.760> loop<00:04:35.030> but<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.960> make<00:04:36.110> it

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
it's a complete loop but to make it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.570 
it's a complete loop but to make it
twisted<00:04:36.590> what<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.890> do<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.400> start

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
twisted what you do is you start

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.730 
twisted what you do is you start
twisting<00:04:38.150> into<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.570> stinging<00:04:38.900> twisting<00:04:39.590> and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
twisting into a stinging twisting and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.350 
twisting into a stinging twisting and
then<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.980> twist<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.370> all<00:04:40.580> so<00:04:40.910> it's<00:04:41.090> all

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
then you twist it all so it's all

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.970 
then you twist it all so it's all
twisted<00:04:41.840> down<00:04:42.020> here<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:44.170> then<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.320> attach<00:04:45.440> it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
twisted down here and then you attach it

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.550 
twisted down here and then you attach it
so<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:46.220> see<00:04:46.460> how<00:04:46.580> these<00:04:46.790> twists<00:04:47.270> are<00:04:47.960> all<00:04:48.200> over

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
so you see how these twists are all over

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.980 
so you see how these twists are all over
yeah<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:50.030> then<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.300> make<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.750> exact<00:04:50.960> same

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
yeah and then you make it the exact same

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.040 
yeah and then you make it the exact same
way<00:04:51.230> okay<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:51.980> there's<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.610> finish<00:04:53.050> finish

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
way okay so there's the finish finish

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.580 
way okay so there's the finish finish
crunchy<00:04:54.440> stretchy<00:04:55.600> it's<00:04:56.600> here<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:57.260> one<00:04:57.470> is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
crunchy stretchy it's here this one is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.740 
crunchy stretchy it's here this one is
less<00:04:57.740> baggy<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.460> if<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.730> don't<00:04:59.210> like<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.570> like

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
less baggy so if you don't like it like

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.740 
less baggy so if you don't like it like
super<00:05:00.410> poof<00:05:00.770> poof<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.520> can<00:05:01.760> make<00:05:01.970> them<00:05:02.180> adjust

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
super poof poof you can make them adjust

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.570 
super poof poof you can make them adjust
the<00:05:02.870> length<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.440> lace<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:03.890> like<00:05:04.250> smaller

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580
