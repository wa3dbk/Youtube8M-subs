00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
car and leave like there is a warm-up

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.609 
car and leave like there is a warm-up
process<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> build<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> process<00:02:04.590> like

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
process there is a build a process like

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.910 
process there is a build a process like
you<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> lot<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.270> prepare<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.259> day<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.649> for

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
you do a lot to prepare the day of for

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520 
you do a lot to prepare the day of for
that<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.670> 20<00:02:09.209> second<00:02:09.539> race<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.379> idea

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that like 20 second race I have no idea

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.040 
that like 20 second race I have no idea
how<00:02:11.069> fast<00:02:11.989> sprints

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
how fast sprints

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
how fast sprints
take<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.860> guess<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.280> probably<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.850> slow

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
take I guess that's probably really slow

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.220 
take I guess that's probably really slow
actually<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> idea<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:18.080> prep<00:02:19.080> yourself

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
actually but the idea is prep yourself

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
actually but the idea is prep yourself
so<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.550> example<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:21.150> your<00:02:21.300> playing<00:02:21.570> league

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
so a good example is your playing league

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.640 
so a good example is your playing league
of<00:02:21.780> legends<00:02:22.140> you're<00:02:22.260> going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.440> play<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.990 
of legends you're going to play in a
tournament<00:02:22.860> could<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> local<00:02:23.670> thing<00:02:23.820> could
