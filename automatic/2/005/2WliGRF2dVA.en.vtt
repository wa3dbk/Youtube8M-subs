in<00:02:32.819> first<00:02:33.150> gear<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.810> showed<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.049> previously

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
in first gear as I showed you previously

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.280 
in first gear as I showed you previously
and<00:02:34.859> you're<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.819> slowly<00:02:36.180> give<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.170> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
and you're going to slowly give it a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.400 
and you're going to slowly give it a
little<00:02:37.530> bit<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.769> gas<00:02:38.600> while<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.900> disengage

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
little bit of gas while you disengage

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.710 
little bit of gas while you disengage
the<00:02:40.620> clutch

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.319 

and<00:02:44.069> then<00:02:45.069> once<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.489> are<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.819> first<00:02:46.090> gear

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
and then once you are in first gear

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.170 
and then once you are in first gear
coasting<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.189> not<00:02:48.340> have<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.819> have<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
coasting you do not have to have the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.220 
coasting you do not have to have the
clutch<00:02:49.360> engaged

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.870 

so<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.440> are<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.710> first<00:02:54.920> gear<00:02:55.160> as<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.430> just<00:02:55.700> showed

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
so we are in first gear as I just showed

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.280 
so we are in first gear as I just showed
you<00:02:55.910> right<00:02:56.390> now<00:02:56.600> we're<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> be<00:02:57.050> into

you right now we're going to be into
moving<00:02:57.650> into<00:02:57.950> will<00:02:58.460> try<00:02:58.760> second<00:02:59.240> and<00:02:59.360> third

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
moving into will try second and third

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
moving into will try second and third
year<00:03:00.020> now<00:03:00.170> with<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.740> clutch<00:03:00.950> engage<00:03:01.310> we're

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
year now with the clutch engage we're

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.040 
year now with the clutch engage we're

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
before in first gear and then as your

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.090 
before in first gear and then as your
rpms<00:03:07.910> increase<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.900> want<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.350> engage<00:03:09.890> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
rpms increase you want to engage the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.600 
rpms increase you want to engage the
clutch<00:03:10.300> shift<00:03:11.300> into<00:03:11.600> second<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.490> repeat<00:03:13.490> the

clutch shift into second and repeat the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.290 
clutch shift into second and repeat the
process

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
process

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.050

so<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:15.530> forth<00:03:15.890> for<00:03:15.950> third<00:03:16.340> fourth<00:03:16.790> up

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
so on and so forth for third fourth up

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:32.970 
so on and so forth for third fourth up
to<00:03:17.270> sixth

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.289

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.869 
you are in the neutral position that way
you<00:03:42.439> don't<00:03:42.560> roll<00:03:42.769> either<00:03:43.040> forward<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.519> back<00:03:43.700> if

you're on a slant or incline make sure
you<00:03:45.950> engage<00:03:46.189> the<00:03:46.670> ebrake<00:03:47.000> as<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:47.870> then

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
you engage the ebrake as so and then
