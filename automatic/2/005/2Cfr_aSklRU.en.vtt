00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.039
 because I'm going to make a video about a 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.660
 hairstyle that I have put to turn you 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.360
 obsessed with him and I 've put many 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.759
 instagram photos and you have started to 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.580
 wondering about him you want me to teach you 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.380
 to make that braid or if they call you 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.720
 florida belinsky is not a braid is 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.269
 much simpler but it 's very apparent 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.749
 and one is experiencing a lot with him 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.749
 so I go here as I do and what 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.749
 possibilities 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.629
 if not 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 and right now I have straight hair but 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.620
 this externalized hairstyle is also 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.580
 fabulous and let's start with a lock 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.260
 in front 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.330
 I have it easy because I have it 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 colored and let's say to separate in 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.840
 two parts we are going to take the lock more 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850
 close to the face and we will go through 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.609
 on top of the other 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.609
 and the next before crossing it as 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.930
 we pick up some hair and we play by 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 over to the next the same with a little 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.790
 of hair and metal in the hair that falls 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.619
 us that is ready but yes that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.380
 have resources without tension but so 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.149
 forward then at the end the stockings 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 that will come out to you will be like that 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.740
 ahead and will not be left today 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:35.210
 and as you can see, this has no more science 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.210
 I end up releasing it 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:55.150
 this can be done so 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.910
 three travelers also here on the road 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.090
 and if we take a ponytail and when not 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.750
 Believed from the sea, just roll up 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.750
 which instead of crossing 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 and then after choosing with click 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.620
 There are other 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:31.520
 in one day in the other new way of doing 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.890
 this also that is pulling the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.610
 millions in the first month are the giles 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.890
 back and roll up jce forward 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.020
 towards the face you can roll it towards 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.590
 forward or backward and the truth that 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.210
 It was a much different look not me 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.010
 it seems much more practicing to roll up 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.710
 Sep and I do not know if you can appreciate the 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.450
 difference between how this is going and 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.000
 how we have stayed 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.440
 this I started doing it because one day for 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.780
 make a pigtail but I did not want to carry 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.910
 the bicycle so I started to roll up 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.890
 but because the braid is a 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.080
 short as you can take it by 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.440
 here by the edge you do exactly what 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.480
 same 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.360
 going up a little bit to make the ponytail 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 I just continue until 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.260
 okay 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:22.680
 but behind what you have left, what 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.530
 you are rolling in on yourself and right now it is 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 one of these wonders for now only 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.819
 to keep line while we still have 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.400
 or not to another side I'll catch him back 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.849
 with something else 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.879
 let's go to why I'm going to do and I'm going to 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.879
 do 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.920
 the hairpins because here it is and how 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.920
 You see, I have a ponytail 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.430
 one 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:12.940
 finally hairstyle has taught I'm going to 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.970
 change the walk because it's another 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.890
 hairstyle that I have not done much but I 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.260
 I like it, although I think it's not what's best 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.660
 I feel and I like it very much 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.200
 then you are going to make a line from 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.930
 here up behind your ear and the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.419
 hair rest 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.860
 you're going to set it apart and audivisual but 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.169
 well I split into three because a lot 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.660
 I put that away and I'm going to do with this 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.199
 exactly the same thing that I have done as 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.199
 float 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.820
 and once you have not finished all with the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.940
 hair and good this is the result 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.940
 I hope you like it 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:17.520
 the photo to twitter facebook I do not know what 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.520
 be and nothing to share this video 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.360
 if not
