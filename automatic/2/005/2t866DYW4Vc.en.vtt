00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
in this video I'll be demonstrating

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.789 
in this video I'll be demonstrating
every<00:00:02.250> single<00:00:02.669> every<00:00:02.820> single<00:00:03.120> every<00:00:04.020> signal

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
every single every single every signal

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.880 
every single every single every signal
code<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.819> my<00:00:05.940> firepro<00:00:06.480> 3002<00:00:07.259> has<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
code that my firepro 3002 has the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.990 
code that my firepro 3002 has the
capability<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.610> doing<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:11.190> currently<00:00:11.820> in

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
capability of doing so it's currently in

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
capability of doing so it's currently in
March<00:00:12.269> time<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:14.089> here<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.179> go<00:00:46.309> now<00:00:47.309> let's<00:00:47.520> put

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
March time so here we go now let's put

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
March time so here we go now let's put
it<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.820> code<00:00:48.030> three<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.800> we'll<00:00:52.800> activate

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it in code three and we'll activate

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:19.380 
it in code three and we'll activate
using<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> fire<00:00:53.699> drill<00:00:53.910> button<00:01:11.150> whatever
