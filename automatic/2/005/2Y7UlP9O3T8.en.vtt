00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.220
 [Applause] 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.000
 hello how about youtube friends I am 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 your friend mike powell and how are you seeing 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.430
 in the title today we are going to learn how to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.220
 enter all of lcd's are 15 for 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 to be exact at 15 vélez is to put them 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 to the pirate game or very important pirate 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.130
 if you have the original game you want 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 put a dlc forget this step 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 because you are going to decompose your game to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.910
 lose your game and they're going to have to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.010
 reinstall it so if you have 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.790
 the original game forget about this 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 method 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 this method is only for those who 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.130
 they have the pirate they are also going to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.660
 you know they are going to access the file 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.630
 lc and the new crack that I will also leave 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.550
 in the description those two files 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.189
 gentlemen are very important obviously 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.189

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 around 342 come already when 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 they extract are more or less 2 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.060
 5 you arrive but the file that you are going to 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.850
 download weights 340 megabytes we download 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.330
 we extract it and we will all be 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 these that tlc gentlemen are all these 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.320
 the duties from the game of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 harder metallic structures the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 all the data and well what are we going to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.050
 to do is go to the ugly folder 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.820
 obviously if you have the game on 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 that two clicks run 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.900
 the one that already comes with all of the stress 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.550
 they no longer need to put this is not 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.990
 is by the method for which 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.170
 downloaded the game and the page 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.060
 official and they do not have any d lc or that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.860
 they do not have all the vélez and here you 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.220
 only one of you here is missing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.960
 catch and put the new crack and well what 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.030
 what are we going to do to put them 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.459
 grays first is to open the folder of the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.459
 good game let's open the folder of 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.440
 the vélez is let's select all or 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.240
 select in which case the one that you lack 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.670
 I'm going to select all that I do not have 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.610
 none more than the ewing though 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 the gold version and you choose the one 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.370
 they are missing give right click obviate and we 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.650
 let's go to the game folder at 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.680
 repeat it the local disk will be files of the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.989
 program 'euro next editor 2 and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.000
 right here without getting us right without 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.820
 put us in any folder right here 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.130
 where is the base here we are going to click 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.780
 to replace in going vélez and clear 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.250
 we replace it nothing happens and we can 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.160
 do this for all the elements 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.460

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.510
 we will see more or less in what I know 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.140
