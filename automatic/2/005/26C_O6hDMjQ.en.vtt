best big phones of the whole year and
their<00:00:25.890> latest<00:00:26.130> release<00:00:26.279> here<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.760> Droid

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.939 
their latest release here in the Droid
turbo<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.019> Moto<00:00:28.199> Maxx<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.830> other

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
turbo or the Moto Maxx on some other

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
turbo or the Moto Maxx on some other
carriers<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> think<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
carriers is actually I think one of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
carriers is actually I think one of
their<00:00:30.869> best<00:00:31.109> experiences<00:00:32.009> yet<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
their best experiences yet so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
their best experiences yet so
essentially<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> turbo<00:00:33.809> offers<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.739> same

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
essentially the turbo offers the same

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.700 
essentially the turbo offers the same
software<00:00:35.700> experience<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.079> Moto<00:00:37.260> X<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.680> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
software experience as the Moto X and I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.930 
software experience as the Moto X and I
talked<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> Moto<00:00:38.879> X

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
review about how Motorola is sticking to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
review about how Motorola is sticking to
near<00:00:41.100> stock<00:00:41.460> Android<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.390> give<00:00:42.540> quick<00:00:42.750> updates

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
near stock Android to give quick updates

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
near stock Android to give quick updates
and<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> adding<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> few<00:00:44.219> features<00:00:44.789> on

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and are just adding a few features on

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.639 
and are just adding a few features on
top<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.420> enhance<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> experience<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
top to enhance the experience so the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
top to enhance the experience so the
turbo<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.399> too<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.390> KitKat

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
turbo does this too and it's on KitKat

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
turbo does this too and it's on KitKat
right<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.680> fingers<00:00:49.890> crossed<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.309> will

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
right now but fingers crossed that will

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.810 
right now but fingers crossed that will
be<00:00:50.610> updated<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> lollipop<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.289> soon<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
be updated to lollipop very soon and the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
be updated to lollipop very soon and the
other<00:00:54.059> software<00:00:54.690> difference<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
other software difference really is that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
other software difference really is that
it<00:00:55.680> has<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:56.010> droid<00:00:56.280> specific<00:00:56.789> widgets<00:00:57.149> some

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it has some droid specific widgets some

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
it has some droid specific widgets some
ringtones<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> wallpapers<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:58.980> that's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
ringtones of wallpapers but that's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
ringtones of wallpapers but that's
basically<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.449> best<00:01:00.719> describe<00:01:00.930> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
basically it so to best describe this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
basically it so to best describe this
phone<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> give<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.059> ways

phone I'm going to give you all the ways

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
phone I'm going to give you all the ways

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that it's different from the 2014 Moto X

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.880 
that it's different from the 2014 Moto X
and<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.750> first<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.260> different<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
and the first way it's different is the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
and the first way it's different is the
build<00:01:08.130> quality<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> materials<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.869> right<00:01:10.020> off

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
build quality and materials so right off

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.300 
build quality and materials so right off
the<00:01:10.140> bat<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.710> looking<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the bat what you're looking at here is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
the bat what you're looking at here is
the<00:01:11.490> black<00:01:11.700> material<00:01:12.180> called<00:01:12.450> ballistic

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the black material called ballistic

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
the black material called ballistic
nylon<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.710> there's<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:14.100> two<00:01:14.130> choices

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
nylon and there's actually two choices

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.060 
nylon and there's actually two choices
and<00:01:14.760> materials<00:01:15.180> ballistic<00:01:15.900> nylon<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.500> Kevlar

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and materials ballistic nylon or Kevlar

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.789 
and materials ballistic nylon or Kevlar
Kevlar<00:01:17.880> comes<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.270> red<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> only<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> 32

Kevlar comes in red and only has a 32
gigabyte<00:01:20.189> version<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> lot<00:01:21.659> smoother

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
gigabyte version looks a lot smoother

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
gigabyte version looks a lot smoother
but<00:01:22.259> honestly<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.340> slippery

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
but honestly also a little bit slippery

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
but honestly also a little bit slippery
err<00:01:23.909> even<00:01:24.659> though<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> haven't<00:01:24.930> held<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
err even though I haven't held one to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.289 
err even though I haven't held one to
determine<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.130> that's<00:01:26.250> true<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
determine if that's true but the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
determine if that's true but the
ballistic<00:01:27.659> nylon<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.350> much<00:01:28.740> more

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
ballistic nylon here is much more

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
ballistic nylon here is much more
textured<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.850> fact<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.689> texture<00:01:31.049> than

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
textured in fact it's more texture than

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.569 
textured in fact it's more texture than
any<00:01:31.320> other<00:01:31.500> phone<00:01:31.770> I've<00:01:31.890> held<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.250> recent

like<00:01:59.130> previous<00:01:59.430> droids<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> feels<00:02:00.750> really

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
like previous droids and it feels really

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
like previous droids and it feels really
durable<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.409> solid<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> hold<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.399> hand

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
durable really solid to hold in the hand

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.370 
durable really solid to hold in the hand
and<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.479> slight<00:02:03.689> curving<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and it has some slight curving like I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
and it has some slight curving like I
said<00:02:04.560> near<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> edges<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> make<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> feel

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
said near the edges that make it feel

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
said near the edges that make it feel
less<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> brick<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> also<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> edge<00:02:07.770> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
less like a brick and also the edge of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.680 
less like a brick and also the edge of
the<00:02:08.039> glass<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.550> curved<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> bit<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.239> well<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the glass are curved a bit as well so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.479 
the glass are curved a bit as well so
the<00:02:09.780> corners<00:02:10.140> aren't<00:02:10.410> sharp<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.310> power

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the corners aren't sharp and the power

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.180 
the corners aren't sharp and the power
and<00:02:11.700> volume<00:02:11.790> buttons<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.300> both<00:02:12.480> texture

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and volume buttons are both texture

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.340 
and volume buttons are both texture
also<00:02:13.640> fun<00:02:13.850> fact<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.330> sim<00:02:14.570> card<00:02:14.810> tray<00:02:14.870> sits

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
also fun fact the sim card tray sits

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.960 
also fun fact the sim card tray sits
behind<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.770> volume<00:02:16.130> keys<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.640> actually

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
behind the volume keys so you actually

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.520 
behind the volume keys so you actually
have<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.180> remove<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> volume<00:02:17.840> buttons<00:02:18.140> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
have to remove the volume buttons to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.410 
have to remove the volume buttons to
change<00:02:18.740> your<00:02:18.950> SIM<00:02:19.130> card<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:19.580> overall<00:02:19.850> this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
change your SIM card but overall this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.460 
change your SIM card but overall this
thing<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.720> built<00:02:20.900> like<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.050> tank

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
thing is built like a tank

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.310 
thing is built like a tank
and<00:02:21.590> speaking<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.640> curved<00:02:23.030> glass<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:24.110> brings

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
and speaking of curved glass that brings

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320 
and speaking of curved glass that brings
us<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.590> number<00:02:24.680> two<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> display

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
us to number two and that's the display

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.570 
us to number two and that's the display
on<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> front<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.230> Droid<00:02:27.470> turbo<00:02:27.710> is<00:02:28.070> rocking

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
on the front the Droid turbo is rocking

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
a 5.2 inch quad HD display so 2560 by

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.400 
a 5.2 inch quad HD display so 2560 by
1440<00:02:32.480> resolution<00:02:32.750> at<00:02:34.300> 565<00:02:35.300> pixels<00:02:36.200> per<00:02:36.380> inch

and it's an OLED display and it's razor

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.990 
and it's an OLED display and it's razor
sharp<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.740> basically<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:40.490> I'm<00:02:40.580> saying<00:02:40.790> here

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000

have complaints that quad HD is just too
much<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.080> a<00:03:15.140> phone<00:03:15.380> or<00:03:15.410> even<00:03:15.650> unnecessary<00:03:16.370> we

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
much on a phone or even unnecessary we

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.250 
much on a phone or even unnecessary we
keep<00:03:16.700> hearing<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.120> as<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.840> could<00:03:17.960> take<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.110> hit

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260

keep hearing that as it could take a hit
on<00:03:18.410> battery<00:03:18.680> life<00:03:18.740> so<00:03:19.220> let's<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:19.670> jump<00:03:19.790> right

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
on battery life so let's just jump right

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.750 
on battery life so let's just jump right
into<00:03:20.240> that<00:03:20.510> number<00:03:20.990> three<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:22.400> battery

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
into that number three is the battery

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.480 
into that number three is the battery
now<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.390> turbo<00:03:23.750> has<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.040> 3900<00:03:25.040> milliamp<00:03:25.340> hour

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
now the turbo has a 3900 milliamp hour

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.430 
now the turbo has a 3900 milliamp hour
battery

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
battery

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440 
battery
3900<00:03:27.440> milliamp<00:03:27.680> hours<00:03:27.920> that's<00:03:28.160> massive<00:03:28.700> so

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
3900 milliamp hours that's massive so

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.640 
3900 milliamp hours that's massive so
you<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:29.660> see<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:29.900> not<00:03:29.990> exactly<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.440> thin

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
you can see it's not exactly a thin

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.690 
you can see it's not exactly a thin
device<00:03:30.770> that's<00:03:31.160> eleven<00:03:31.430> point<00:03:31.640> two

curves you know there's no dimple on the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.010 
curves you know there's no dimple on the
back<00:03:34.490> anymore<00:03:34.760> it's<00:03:35.090> just<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.390> big<00:03:35.660> flat

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
smoothly on the quad HD display so this

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.540

is what I get all the time on this one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.480 
is what I get all the time on this one
I'm<00:04:05.360> usually<00:04:05.510> getting<00:04:05.810> about<00:04:06.410> 6<00:04:06.860> on<00:04:07.040> the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
I'm usually getting about 6 on the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.340 
I'm usually getting about 6 on the
oneplus<00:04:07.850> one<00:04:08.150> which<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.570> probably<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.020> best

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
oneplus one which is probably the best

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.830 
oneplus one which is probably the best
of<00:04:09.650> any<00:04:09.950> 1080p<00:04:10.550> phone<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:10.940> that's<00:04:11.090> really<00:04:11.480> good

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
of any 1080p phone so that's really good

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.320 
of any 1080p phone so that's really good
for<00:04:12.440> quad<00:04:12.650> HD<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:13.550> actually<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> best

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
for quad HD and it's actually the best

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.240 
for quad HD and it's actually the best
battery<00:04:14.720> life<00:04:14.750> I've<00:04:15.050> gotten<00:04:15.350> out<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.770> any<00:04:15.980> quad

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
battery life I've gotten out of any quad

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
battery life I've gotten out of any quad
HD<00:04:16.370> phone<00:04:16.790> including<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.480> note<00:04:17.630> 4<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.170> date<00:04:18.380> so

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
HD phone including the note 4 to date so

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.410 
HD phone including the note 4 to date so
that's<00:04:18.709> super<00:04:19.100> impressive<00:04:19.430> obviously<00:04:20.239> if<00:04:20.330> you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
that's super impressive obviously if you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.909 
that's super impressive obviously if you
have<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.540> 1080p<00:04:20.810> display<00:04:21.080> on<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> front<00:04:21.680> it

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
have a 1080p display on the front it

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.830 
have a 1080p display on the front it
would<00:04:22.040> last<00:04:22.190> even<00:04:22.550> longer<00:04:22.790> but<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.419> think<00:04:23.720> this

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
would last even longer but I think this

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.300 
would last even longer but I think this
is<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> nice<00:04:24.169> trade-off<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.919> it's<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.130> pretty

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
is a nice trade-off and it's a pretty

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.470 
is a nice trade-off and it's a pretty
good<00:04:25.520> balancing<00:04:26.000> act<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.300> I'm

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
good balancing act and I'm

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.940 
good balancing act and I'm
very<00:04:26.600> impressed<00:04:26.960> once<00:04:27.170> again<00:04:27.410> with<00:04:27.860> the

everything<00:05:17.480> I've<00:05:17.570> mentioned<00:05:17.960> here<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:18.290> an

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
everything I've mentioned here is an

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.290 
everything I've mentioned here is an
improvement<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.190> camera<00:05:19.580> is<00:05:19.700> better<00:05:19.940> the

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
improvement the camera is better the

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.690 
improvement the camera is better the
battery<00:05:20.660> is<00:05:20.810> bigger<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.740> display<00:05:22.160> is<00:05:22.310> sharper

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
battery is bigger the display is sharper

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.100 
battery is bigger the display is sharper
and<00:05:22.850> better-looking<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.540> mean<00:05:23.840> everything

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
and better-looking I mean everything

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.320 
and better-looking I mean everything
seems<00:05:24.530> like<00:05:24.800> it's<00:05:24.980> taken<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.370> step<00:05:25.580> forward<00:05:25.640> and

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
seems like it's taken a step forward and

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.150 
seems like it's taken a step forward and
that's<00:05:26.750> why<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:26.930> say<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.320> experience<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:28.070> the

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
that's why I say the experience of the

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.280 
that's why I say the experience of the
Droid<00:05:28.370> turbo<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:28.850> top-notch<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.750> biggest

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
Droid turbo is top-notch the biggest

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
old speaker like the grille might imply

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.670

it<00:05:46.670> is<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.600> it<00:05:47.720> didn't<00:05:48.080> sound<00:05:48.260> very<00:05:48.350> good<00:05:48.500> at

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
it is and it didn't sound very good at

it is and it didn't sound very good at
high<00:05:48.800> volumes<00:05:49.190> at<00:05:49.340> all<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.730> you<00:05:49.790> lose<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.150> on

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
high volumes at all and you lose that on

the<00:05:50.360> stereo<00:05:50.720> audio<00:05:50.930> on<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.440> phone<00:05:51.590> is

the stereo audio on the phone is
sideways<00:05:52.130> but<00:05:52.670> even<00:05:52.910> so<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.420> adds<00:05:53.720> still<00:05:54.020> take

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
sideways but even so it adds still take

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.680 
sideways but even so it adds still take
it<00:05:54.440> over<00:05:54.740> any<00:05:54.890> rear-facing<00:05:55.160> speaker<00:05:55.940> so

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
it over any rear-facing speaker so

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.780 
it over any rear-facing speaker so
that's<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.230> it's<00:05:57.410> a<00:05:57.560> droid<00:05:57.770> turbo<00:05:57.980> if<00:05:58.370> you're

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
on Verizon it's pretty much between this
