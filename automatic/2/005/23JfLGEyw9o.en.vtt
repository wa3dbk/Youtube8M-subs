and the danny galvers who I've actually

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
and the danny galvers who I've actually
put<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> Daniels<00:01:28.350> could<00:01:28.500> be

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
put right back but it Daniels could be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
put right back but it Daniels could be
included<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.040> deal<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.450> it

included in this deal and I think it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
included in this deal and I think it
probably<00:01:30.840> Danny<00:01:31.110> always<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:31.650> 15<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.280> 20

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.819 
actually helped with Renaldo's and
Arsenal<00:02:37.239> do<00:02:37.420> need<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.689> striker<00:02:37.959> badly<00:02:38.469> a<00:02:38.500> goal

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
Arsenal do need a striker badly a goal

scoring strike girl as you roost I'm
very<00:02:41.049> well<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.680> Balotelli<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.400> think<00:02:42.969> he's<00:02:43.090> at

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
very well but Balotelli I think he's at

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.240 
very well but Balotelli I think he's at
next<00:02:43.510> level<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.439> with<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.739> services<00:02:45.189> of

Ramsey<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.939> think<00:02:49.540> Balotelli<00:02:50.019> could<00:02:50.200> thrive

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
Ramsey I think Balotelli could thrive

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.619 
Ramsey I think Balotelli could thrive
under<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.889> and<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.519> next<00:02:51.849> one<00:02:51.939> is<00:02:51.969> kind<00:02:52.480> of

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
under that and this next one is kind of

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.479 
under that and this next one is kind of
unlikely<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:53.199> my<00:02:53.349> opinion<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:53.859> it<00:02:53.980> also<00:02:54.159> has

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489

lavezzi<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.870> think<00:04:39.110> he<00:04:39.320> would<00:04:39.380> be<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> decent

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
lavezzi and I think he would be a decent

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.680 
lavezzi and I think he would be a decent
replacement<00:04:40.160> for<00:04:40.580> hazard<00:04:40.880> personally<00:04:41.600> I

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
replacement for hazard personally I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.030 
replacement for hazard personally I
think<00:04:41.750> Chelsea<00:04:42.320> would<00:04:42.350> be<00:04:42.470> quite<00:04:42.680> stooped<00:04:42.950> to

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
think Chelsea would be quite stooped to

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.980 
think Chelsea would be quite stooped to
get<00:04:43.160> rid<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.310> hazard<00:04:43.640> for<00:04:43.820> do<00:04:44.510> cost<00:04:44.780> and

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
get rid of hazard for do cost and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.170 
get rid of hazard for do cost and
Lavezzi<00:04:45.560> personally<00:04:46.010> asked<00:04:46.130> my<00:04:46.280> opinion<00:04:46.370> but

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
Lavezzi personally asked my opinion but

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.720 
Lavezzi personally asked my opinion but
like<00:04:47.720> I<00:04:47.750> said<00:04:47.780> hazard<00:04:48.470> if<00:04:48.620> he<00:04:48.710> goes<00:04:48.950> Lavezzi

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
like I said hazard if he goes Lavezzi

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.490 
like I said hazard if he goes Lavezzi
would<00:04:49.820> be<00:04:49.910> an<00:04:50.150> easy<00:04:50.570> replacement<00:04:50.990> kind<00:04:51.440> of
