brings to the table first of all as I
just<00:01:44.970> mentioned<00:01:45.420> you've<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.659> support<00:01:45.840> for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just mentioned you've got support for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
just mentioned you've got support for
Eyefinity<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.100> ATI<00:01:47.520> has<00:01:47.880> updated<00:01:48.420> their

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
Eyefinity so ATI has updated their

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899

drivers to support eyefinity in

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.749 
drivers to support eyefinity in
crossfire<00:01:51.509> mode<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.520> dual

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
crossfire mode because this is a dual

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
crossfire mode because this is a dual
GPU<00:01:54.030> card<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.079> clearly<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> back

we<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.340> plates<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:57.180> 2<00:01:57.420> video

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
we have back plates for 2 video

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
we have back plates for 2 video
processing<00:01:58.680> units<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> means<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
processing units so that means that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050 
processing units so that means that
Eyefinity<00:02:00.780> has<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.439> output<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> 3<00:02:02.549> displays

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
from 2 different video processors it's a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.340 
from 2 different video processors it's a
very<00:02:06.299> complicated<00:02:06.689> driver<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> me

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
very complicated driver and what it me

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.900 
very complicated driver and what it me
is<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.010> only<00:02:09.370> games<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.790> are

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
is that the only games that are

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.810 
is that the only games that are
supported<00:02:10.390> are<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.900> ones<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.200> ATI

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
supported are the ones that ATI

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.130 
supported are the ones that ATI
specifically<00:02:12.820> unlocks<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.810> work<00:02:13.990> in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
specifically unlocks to work in

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530 
specifically unlocks to work in
Eyefinity<00:02:14.620> mode<00:02:14.770> with<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.070> card<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.940> kind

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
Eyefinity mode with this card it's kind

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.300 
Eyefinity mode with this card it's kind
of<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.780> kludge<00:02:16.990> right<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> think<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
of a kludge right now but I think that

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
of a kludge right now but I think that
support<00:02:18.700> will<00:02:18.940> improve<00:02:19.360> over<00:02:19.630> time<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
support will improve over time and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
support will improve over time and
already<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.040> list<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.370> games<00:02:21.550> supported<00:02:21.970> is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
already the list of games supported is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.850 
already the list of games supported is
quite<00:02:22.300> good<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.020> all<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.260> left<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.710> talk

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
quite good so all that's left to talk

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.770 
quite good so all that's left to talk
about<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> conclusion<00:02:24.910> basically<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
about is the conclusion basically the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.660 
about is the conclusion basically the
features<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.350> card<00:02:26.620> are<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.040> complete<00:02:27.400> as
