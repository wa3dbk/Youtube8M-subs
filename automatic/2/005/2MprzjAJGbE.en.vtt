thing<00:03:07.080> about<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.860> cut<00:03:08.070> at<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> bottom

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
thing about it is the cut at the bottom

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.100 
thing about it is the cut at the bottom
I<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.910> think<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.150> super<00:03:09.420> flattering<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.190 
I just think it's super flattering and
it's<00:03:10.950> kind<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> longer<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> back<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.420> it's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
it's kind of longer at the back so it's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
it's kind of longer at the back so it's
not<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.560> those<00:03:13.709> tight<00:03:14.040> skirts<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.459> wear<00:03:14.580> and

not like those tight skirts you wear and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.980 
not like those tight skirts you wear and

then you bend over your butt comes out

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.660 
then you bend over your butt comes out
and<00:03:16.200> last<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:16.740> not<00:03:16.800> least<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.370> leather

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.260 
have like this reflective blue greeny
lens<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.010> picked<00:04:47.280> those<00:04:47.460> ones<00:04:47.730> out<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.120> then

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
lens so I picked those ones out and then

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.820 
lens so I picked those ones out and then
the<00:04:48.360> second<00:04:48.660> pair<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> got<00:04:48.990> are<00:04:49.110> these<00:04:49.140> ones<00:04:49.530> and

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.080 
the second pair I got are these ones and
I<00:04:50.370> thought<00:04:50.490> they<00:04:50.610> were<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.760> little<00:04:50.880> bit

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
I thought they were a little bit

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.400 
I thought they were a little bit
different<00:04:51.480> they<00:04:51.930> have<00:04:52.050> kind<00:04:52.170> of<00:04:52.290> like<00:04:52.380> a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
different they have kind of like a

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.490 
different they have kind of like a
slight<00:04:52.860> cat<00:04:53.250> eye<00:04:53.280> effect<00:04:53.490> going<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.240> um<00:04:55.080> kind

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
slight cat eye effect going on um kind

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.080 
slight cat eye effect going on um kind
of<00:04:55.590> more<00:04:55.740> like<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.920> retro<00:04:56.190> look<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:56.820> thought

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
of more like a retro look so I thought

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.480
