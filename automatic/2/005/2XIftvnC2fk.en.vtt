separated from their mouldings and I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
separated from their mouldings and I
like<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> pretend<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.140> doing<00:01:40.409> by

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like to pretend I know what I'm doing by

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.070 
like to pretend I know what I'm doing by
using<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.890> sharp<00:01:41.130> knife<00:01:41.780> fitting<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> mirrors

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
using a sharp knife fitting the mirrors

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.660 
using a sharp knife fitting the mirrors
is<00:01:43.229> easy<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:43.650> they've<00:01:43.950> been<00:01:44.070> designed<00:01:44.490> in

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
is easy because they've been designed in

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
is easy because they've been designed in
a<00:01:44.729> way<00:01:44.880> which<00:01:45.060> means<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.570> only<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.140> way

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a way which means I can only go one way

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.499 
a way which means I can only go one way
up<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:47.549> were<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.850> good<00:01:47.939> fit<00:01:48.299> into

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
up and they were pretty good fit into

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910 
up and they were pretty good fit into
the<00:01:48.689> holes<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> cab<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> they<00:01:49.680> stay<00:01:49.890> in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the holes of the cab so they stay in

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.700 
the holes of the cab so they stay in
place<00:01:50.040> well<00:01:50.780> after<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> quick<00:01:52.020> handbrake<00:01:52.470> turn

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
place well after a quick handbrake turn

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.140 
place well after a quick handbrake turn
we<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.009> fit<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> mirror<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> other<00:01:53.790> side

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
we can fit the mirror on the other side

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.929 
we can fit the mirror on the other side
and<00:01:54.950> there's<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.220> mirror<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> needs<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and there's also a mirror that needs to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
and there's also a mirror that needs to
be<00:01:56.970> fitted<00:01:57.270> over<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> top<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.619> passenger

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
be fitted over the top of the passenger

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.760

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
door that one's also quite a good tight
fit<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.070> there's<00:02:02.399> no<00:02:02.490> need<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> worry<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
implemented on the model is that the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.970 
implemented on the model is that the
