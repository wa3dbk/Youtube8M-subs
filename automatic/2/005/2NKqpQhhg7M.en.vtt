00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello to everyone I'm the challenge of 110 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.370
 and well after having thrown several 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.309
 several edges to this game mode that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 it's transit this I come to bring a couple of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 little things that may interest that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 still going up in a few videos in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.150
 sauteed videos for you to go 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 watching and do not get tired if you do not see it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.119
 all the pull that maybe brings you a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.829
 little bit of complications then 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.739
 comes with the necessary chairs and 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.229
 things that may interest us since 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.750
 you can open doors for example without 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:37.290
 spend money and the first one that I bring you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 it's just nothing else to start 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.180
 start in 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.230
 the map appears in the first station 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.570
 train 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.870
 of bus train and it's something that good can 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.410
 be the first door without needing 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.620
 pay then they lowered three ribs 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.750
 repair of one is for example this 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.199
 that we are going to catch now you can catch and 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.680
 put it on the good table table 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.870
 Creation table mixes like us 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.870
 and I've seen seven years 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.980
 a propeller of a 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.350
 of a fan that good also the 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.450
 we put here and then there is another one that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.740
 If you do not know where is a little 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.740
 hidden and this is 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 and after this 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 saying 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 good are three pieces with this that with 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.659
 a strange fan that for those who 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.820
 you have played and aniaiz advanced and ospina 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.710
 doors that you need electricity 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.659
 these will allow to open the doors 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.260
 now you will see a small demonstration of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.260
 what you can do 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.360
 this would be more or less this you can 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.880
 use on all doors that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 require electricity so it's something 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.729
 very useful and what I hope you have 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.729
 liked 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.470
 a portable wind generator 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.470
 of the genius of the place 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.590
 another little thing that I really do not know 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.900
 what are they for serving yet and 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 is what are you going to see now if we pass 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 around here it takes us to a place where 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.950
 we can take a card we can take 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.680
 a card that will appear to us 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.300
 right of the score and that is something 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.440
 strange because I do not know if all the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.350
 from the same place since we have 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.760
 then started another game in which 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.500
 we have appeared directly with the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.620
 cards is something that we're still 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.209
 investigating and nothing else to know you 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.489
 I will comment so I hope that I have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.989
 liked the video that has served you and 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.730
 be vigilant because soon 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.560
 I will upload another of the artifacts that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.400
 we can manufacture in this game mode 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.400
 what is transit
