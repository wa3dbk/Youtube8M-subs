involvement with the mp4-12c is
basically<00:00:39.260> try<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.910> turn<00:00:40.910> an<00:00:41.210> engineered<00:00:41.750> car

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
basically try to turn an engineered car

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.280 
basically try to turn an engineered car
into<00:00:42.920> something<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:43.190> people<00:00:43.580> want<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.820> buy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
into something that people want to buy

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.650 
into something that people want to buy
the<00:00:45.290> inspiration<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.010> car<00:00:46.280> is<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:47.540> know

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
the inspiration for this car is you know

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.119 
the inspiration for this car is you know
a<00:00:47.690> lot<00:00:48.110> of<00:00:48.199> designers<00:00:48.530> talk<00:00:48.680> about<00:00:48.920> being

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
a lot of designers talk about being

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.490 
a lot of designers talk about being
inspired<00:00:49.519> by<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:49.989> nature<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.290> all<00:00:51.350> that

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
inspired by this nature and all that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.070 
inspired by this nature and all that
kind<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.739> stuff<00:00:51.980> which<00:00:52.370> is<00:00:52.400> okay<00:00:53.059> but<00:00:53.720> really

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
kind of stuff which is okay but really

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.020 
kind of stuff which is okay but really
at<00:00:54.170> McLaren<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:54.710> not<00:00:54.830> really<00:00:55.070> about<00:00:55.250> styling

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
at McLaren it's not really about styling

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.850 
at McLaren it's not really about styling
the<00:00:56.330> car<00:00:56.540> designing<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.350> car<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:57.680> more

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
the car designing the car it's more

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.979 
the car designing the car it's more
about<00:00:58.100> taking<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:59.120> product<00:00:59.600> that's<00:00:59.780> been

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
about taking a product that's been

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.260 
about taking a product that's been
engineered<00:01:00.640> optimally<00:01:01.640> engineered<00:01:02.059> as<00:01:02.180> we

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
engineered optimally engineered as we

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.900 
engineered optimally engineered as we
call<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:03.350> trying<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.829> shrink<00:01:04.610> wrap

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
call it and then trying to shrink wrap

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.630 
call it and then trying to shrink wrap
it<00:01:05.059> with<00:01:05.180> some<00:01:05.540> surface<00:01:06.110> metal<00:01:06.320> over<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.710> or

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
it with some surface metal over it or

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.340 
it with some surface metal over it or
whatever<00:01:07.820> type<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.330> material<00:01:08.660> we<00:01:08.720> use<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.050> and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
whatever type of material we use it and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.320 
whatever type of material we use it and
so<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.340> can't<00:01:10.550> really<00:01:10.640> say<00:01:10.820> we<00:01:11.000> were<00:01:11.090> inspired

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
so I can't really say we were inspired

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.260 
so I can't really say we were inspired
by<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:12.740> know<00:01:12.860> anything<00:01:13.700> out<00:01:13.820> there<00:01:13.970> except

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
by you know anything out there except

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.430 
by you know anything out there except
just<00:01:14.420> by<00:01:14.539> trying<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:14.990> make<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.320> most

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
just by trying to make it the most

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.650 
just by trying to make it the most
efficient<00:01:15.950> car<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.280> could<00:01:16.490> epic<00:01:17.210> Larry<00:01:17.450> we've

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
efficient car we could epic Larry we've

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.420 
efficient car we could epic Larry we've
got<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:18.050> very<00:01:18.380> very<00:01:18.649> special<00:01:18.860> relationship

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
got a very very special relationship

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.190 
got a very very special relationship
with<00:01:19.520> engineers<00:01:19.970> normally<00:01:20.930> you<00:01:21.080> would

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
with engineers normally you would

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.810 
with engineers normally you would
actually<00:01:21.380> lock<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.039> designers<00:01:22.460> for<00:01:22.640> six

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
actually lock up the designers for six

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.550 
actually lock up the designers for six
months<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.210> let<00:01:23.330> them<00:01:23.509> go<00:01:23.840> at<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.350> be<00:01:24.470> as

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
months and let them go at it and be as

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.969 
months and let them go at it and be as
creative<00:01:24.740> as<00:01:25.009> they<00:01:25.100> could<00:01:26.860> designers<00:01:27.860> don't

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
creative as they could designers don't

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.469 
creative as they could designers don't
want<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.250> be<00:01:28.310> disturbed<00:01:28.610> for<00:01:28.789> six<00:01:29.090> months<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
want to be disturbed for six months and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.090 
want to be disturbed for six months and
then<00:01:29.570> they'll<00:01:29.750> present<00:01:30.259> their<00:01:30.560> ideas<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
then they'll present their ideas to the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.800 
then they'll present their ideas to the
engineers<00:01:31.490> that's<00:01:32.149> where<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.390> conflict

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
engineers that's where the conflict

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.150 
engineers that's where the conflict
really<00:01:32.990> starts<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.649> if<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.800> engineers

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
really starts because if the engineers

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.699 
really starts because if the engineers
are<00:01:34.340> really<00:01:34.520> pushed<00:01:35.330> into<00:01:35.539> a<00:01:35.630> corner<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.170> have

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
are really pushed into a corner and have

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.529 
are really pushed into a corner and have
to<00:01:36.830> come<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.039> with<00:01:37.220> ways<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:37.970> build<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.360> car

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
to come up with ways to build the car

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.660 
to come up with ways to build the car
that<00:01:38.660> basically<00:01:39.050> are<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.860> know<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:39.979> dream

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
that basically are you know just dream

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.940 
that basically are you know just dream
ideas<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.630> without<00:01:41.929> really<00:01:42.500> any

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
ideas that without really any

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.589 
ideas that without really any
feasibility<00:01:43.640> really<00:01:43.880> coming<00:01:44.330> through<00:01:44.360> at

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
feasibility really coming through at

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.900 
feasibility really coming through at
that<00:01:44.630> point<00:01:44.950> what<00:01:45.950> we<00:01:46.069> try<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.459> at<00:01:46.520> McLaren

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
that point what we try to do at McLaren

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.400 
that point what we try to do at McLaren
is<00:01:47.000> really<00:01:47.240> speed<00:01:47.509> up<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> process<00:01:48.200> it's

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
is really speed up the process it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.600 
is really speed up the process it's
about<00:01:48.560> getting<00:01:48.830> through<00:01:49.220> that<00:01:49.399> whole

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
about getting through that whole

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.660 
about getting through that whole
creative<00:01:50.450> face<00:01:50.780> as<00:01:50.959> quickly<00:01:51.200> as<00:01:51.380> possible<00:01:51.830> we

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
creative face as quickly as possible we

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.639 
creative face as quickly as possible we
don't<00:01:52.849> try<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.360> water<00:01:53.599> down<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.899> ideas<00:01:54.380> at<00:01:54.560> all

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
don't try to water down the ideas at all

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.190 
don't try to water down the ideas at all
a<00:01:55.310> lot<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:55.910> times<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.240> very<00:01:56.479> first<00:01:56.690> ideas<00:01:57.050> that

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
a lot of times the very first ideas that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.229 
a lot of times the very first ideas that
come<00:01:57.289> out<00:01:57.410> are<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.800> best<00:01:57.979> ideas<00:01:58.369> but<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:59.090> only

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
come out are the best ideas but the only

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.029 
come out are the best ideas but the only
way<00:01:59.420> actually<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.869> get<00:01:59.989> to<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.349> point<00:02:00.590> that

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
way actually to get to that point that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.650 
way actually to get to that point that
quickness<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.550> involved<00:02:01.940> engineers<00:02:02.360> right

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
quickness to involved engineers right

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.510 
quickness to involved engineers right
from<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.989> beginning<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.500> process<00:02:03.709> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
from the beginning of the process so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.830 
from the beginning of the process so
what<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.759> do<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.330> engineers<00:02:05.660> and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
what we do is we have the engineers and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.050 
what we do is we have the engineers and
designers<00:02:06.170> working<00:02:06.530> hand-in-hand<00:02:07.520> right

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
designers working hand-in-hand right

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.540 
designers working hand-in-hand right
from<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.450> initiation<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.770> project<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
from the initiation of the project and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.890 
from the initiation of the project and
the<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.180> car<00:02:11.390> hasn't<00:02:11.569> really<00:02:11.810> been

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the this car hasn't really been

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
influenced by the other car because it's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.440 
influenced by the other car because it's
it's<00:02:14.390> new<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.020> mean<00:02:15.349> it's<00:02:15.500> not<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:17.330> know

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450

McLaren is going in this to not just try

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.790 
McLaren is going in this to not just try
to<00:02:19.790> be<00:02:20.030> competing<00:02:20.870> head-on<00:02:21.319> with<00:02:21.530> all<00:02:21.709> the

other manufacturers of the supercar

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.850 
other manufacturers of the supercar
business<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.200> that's<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.470> big<00:02:24.620> sense

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
business but that that's a big sense

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.869 
business but that that's a big sense
there's<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> lot<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.340> good<00:02:25.459> companies<00:02:25.730> out

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
there's a lot of good companies out

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.160 
there's a lot of good companies out
there<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.239> first<00:02:26.420> place<00:02:26.510> why<00:02:26.870> would<00:02:27.050> we

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
there in the first place why would we

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
there in the first place why would we
want<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.440> go<00:02:27.530> ahead<00:02:27.590> on<00:02:27.800> with<00:02:28.489> them<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:28.819> our

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
want to go ahead on with them so our

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.479 
want to go ahead on with them so our
target<00:02:29.360> really<00:02:29.569> is<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.780> shoot<00:02:30.020> above<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
target really is to shoot above the the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.880 
target really is to shoot above the the
compared<00:02:31.879> comparable<00:02:32.629> manufacturers<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
compared comparable manufacturers and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.320 
compared comparable manufacturers and
offer<00:02:34.099> cars<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.580> those<00:02:34.700> segments<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.239> are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
offer cars in those segments that are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.680 
offer cars in those segments that are
almost<00:02:35.450> dealing<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.230> cars<00:02:36.440> on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
almost dealing with the cars on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.960 
almost dealing with the cars on
segment<00:02:37.140> above<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:38.130> we're<00:02:38.430> shooting<00:02:38.610> above

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
segment above so we're shooting above

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.580 
segment above so we're shooting above
those<00:02:39.210> cars<00:02:39.510> whether<00:02:40.260> we're<00:02:40.440> being

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
those cars whether we're being

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.650 
those cars whether we're being
influenced<00:02:41.010> by<00:02:41.070> them<00:02:41.310> or<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.550> no<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> think

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
influenced by them or not no I think

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.240 
influenced by them or not no I think
what<00:02:42.960> we<00:02:43.080> started<00:02:43.320> with<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.470> clean<00:02:44.220> sheet

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
what we started with a clean sheet

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.030 
what we started with a clean sheet
allows<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.240> actually<00:02:45.410> be<00:02:46.410> much<00:02:46.830> more

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
allows you to actually be much more

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.290 
allows you to actually be much more
innovative<00:02:47.280> come<00:02:47.700> up<00:02:47.820> with<00:02:47.940> ideas<00:02:48.180> that

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
innovative come up with ideas that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.340 
innovative come up with ideas that
haven't<00:02:48.450> been<00:02:48.570> done<00:02:48.810> before<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:50.190> racing

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
haven't been done before use racing

haven't been done before use racing
influenced<00:02:52.350> development<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.370> lot<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.520> stuff

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
influenced development a lot of stuff

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150 
influenced development a lot of stuff
that<00:02:54.270> isn't<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:54.630> allowed<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.650> Formula<00:02:56.010> one

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that isn't really allowed in Formula one

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.100 
that isn't really allowed in Formula one
we<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.460> actually<00:02:56.580> apply<00:02:56.790> those<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.660> road

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
we can actually apply those to the road

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.900 
we can actually apply those to the road
cars<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> very<00:02:59.160> close<00:02:59.370> link<00:02:59.640> with

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
the car that was so successful for us

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.710 
the car that was so successful for us
the<00:03:07.080> mid-90s<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.310> car<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> still<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:09.630> me

the mid-90s that car is still for me

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.320 
the mid-90s that car is still for me
probably<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.560> most<00:03:10.830> truest<00:03:11.370> honest

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
supercar in the business there there are

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.680 
supercar in the business there there are
two<00:03:14.340> elements<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.790> are<00:03:14.940> most<00:03:15.090> proud<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.360> on

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
two elements that are most proud of on

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.900 
two elements that are most proud of on
this<00:03:16.020> car<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.950> definitely<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.580> air<00:03:17.700> brake

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
this car one is definitely the air brake

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.700 
this car one is definitely the air brake
what<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.210> have<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.510> rear<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:19.050> it's<00:03:19.470> been

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
what we have in the rear it's it's been

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.320 
what we have in the rear it's it's been
designed<00:03:19.980> styled<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.640> course<00:03:20.880> but<00:03:21.120> it's

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
designed styled of course but it's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.450 
designed styled of course but it's
really<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.260> optimized<00:03:22.710> aerodynamics<00:03:23.400> that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
really the optimized aerodynamics that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.250 
really the optimized aerodynamics that
make<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.760> work<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.120> well<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.780> acts<00:03:25.140> to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
make it work so well it acts to

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.500 
make it work so well it acts to
stabilize<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.890> car<00:03:26.070> when<00:03:26.220> you're<00:03:26.310> braking<00:03:26.670> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
stabilize the car when you're braking it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.060 
stabilize the car when you're braking it
works<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.960> such<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> way<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.680> get<00:03:28.890> more

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
works in such a way that you get more

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.040 
works in such a way that you get more
braking<00:03:29.520> force<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.150> car<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.420> more<00:03:30.600> stable

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
braking force the car is more stable

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.140 
braking force the car is more stable
because<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.320> keeps<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.680> rear<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.250> nails<00:03:32.910> are

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
because it keeps the rear in nails are

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.790 
because it keeps the rear in nails are
planted<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.720> ground<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.650> looks

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
planted on the ground and it looks

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.360 
planted on the ground and it looks
really<00:03:34.890> good

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
really good

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.760 
really good
it<00:03:35.690> you<00:03:36.690> know<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.110> looks<00:03:37.320> like<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> car<00:03:37.740> is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
it you know it looks like the car is

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.620 
it you know it looks like the car is
alive<00:03:38.040> when<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:38.370> working<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:39.270> other<00:03:39.390> one

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
alive when it's working the other one

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.820 
alive when it's working the other one
that<00:03:39.780> I'm<00:03:39.870> very<00:03:39.900> very<00:03:40.140> proud<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.800> the

that I'm very very proud of is the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.760 
that I'm very very proud of is the
actual<00:03:41.310> side<00:03:41.490> intakes<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> car<00:03:42.380> all<00:03:43.380> cars

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
actual side intakes in the car all cars

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.140 
actual side intakes in the car all cars
of<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.040> type<00:03:44.100> need<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.550> get<00:03:44.670> lots<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.970> air

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
of this type need to get lots of air

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.340 
of this type need to get lots of air
into<00:03:45.480> them<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.660> feed<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.959> engine<00:03:46.080> they're

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
into them to feed the engine they're

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.580 
into them to feed the engine they're
high-performance<00:03:46.980> engines<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:49.230> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
high-performance engines but the the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.290 
high-performance engines but the the
whole<00:03:49.980> objective<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.580> tried<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.090> make<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
whole objective it tried to make the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.490 
whole objective it tried to make the
footprint<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> car<00:03:52.020> as<00:03:52.140> small<00:03:52.380> as

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
footprint of the car as small as

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.470 
footprint of the car as small as
possible<00:03:52.820> required<00:03:53.820> us<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.180> put<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
possible required us to put the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.510 
possible required us to put the
radiators<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:54.959> car<00:03:55.680> line<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.160> they're<00:03:56.370> not

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
radiators in car line so they're not

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.490 
radiators in car line so they're not
really<00:03:56.850> making<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.690> car<00:03:57.870> any<00:03:58.050> wider<00:03:58.260> than

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
really making the car any wider than

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.410 
really making the car any wider than
actually<00:03:58.709> we're<00:03:59.160> able<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.880> make<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> car<00:04:00.270> lot

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
actually we're able to make the car lot

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.540 
actually we're able to make the car lot
less<00:04:00.720> they're<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.020> lot<00:04:01.470> more<00:04:01.500> narrow<00:04:01.830> than<00:04:02.070> the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
less they're a lot more narrow than the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.479 
less they're a lot more narrow than the
usual<00:04:02.940> car<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.920> challenge<00:04:05.280> then

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
usual car and the the challenge then

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.710 
usual car and the the challenge then
came<00:04:05.670> up<00:04:05.700> with<00:04:06.000> how<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.150> actually<00:04:06.480> feed<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
came up with how to actually feed the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.449 
came up with how to actually feed the
air<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.170> efficiently<00:04:07.620> how<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.100> get<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.340> air

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
air and efficiently how to get the air

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.270 
air and efficiently how to get the air
to<00:04:08.670> turn<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.030> 90<00:04:09.330> degrees<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.900> those<00:04:10.680> wings

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
to turn in 90 degrees and those wings

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.520 
to turn in 90 degrees and those wings
that<00:04:11.550> we've<00:04:11.700> worked<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.870> hard<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.380> get

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that we've worked on very hard to get

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.039 
that we've worked on very hard to get
the<00:04:13.650> work<00:04:13.800> when<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.310> work<00:04:14.690> efficiently<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.900> get

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
the work when to work efficiently to get

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.770 
the work when to work efficiently to get
into<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.320> radiators<00:04:16.650> one<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.190> most

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
into the radiators one of the most

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.479 
into the radiators one of the most
coolest<00:04:18.780> things<00:04:18.959> on<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.200> car<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> think

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
coolest things on the car I think

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.499 
coolest things on the car I think
you<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.090> interior<00:04:21.449> is

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
you know and then the interior is

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:22.790 
you know and then the interior is
another<00:04:21.750> special<00:04:22.139> part<00:04:22.319> of<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.500> car<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.710> think

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
another special part of this car I think

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.850 
another special part of this car I think
it<00:04:23.550> really<00:04:23.789> does<00:04:24.030> communicate<00:04:24.870> sort<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.800> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
it really does communicate sort of a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.950 
it really does communicate sort of a
future<00:04:26.250> direction<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:26.789> design<00:04:27.090> which<00:04:27.720> is

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
future direction in design which is

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.620 
future direction in design which is
today<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:28.949> see<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.220> lot<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.460> cars<00:04:29.849> piloted<00:04:30.509> all

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
today you see a lot of cars piloted all

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.809 
today you see a lot of cars piloted all
the<00:04:30.780> buttons<00:04:31.139> and<00:04:31.349> all<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> controls<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.639> you

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
the buttons and all the controls and you

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:33.950 
the buttons and all the controls and you
start<00:04:33.060> getting<00:04:33.300> these<00:04:33.389> things<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.780> look

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
start getting these things that look

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.020 
start getting these things that look
like<00:04:33.990> airplane<00:04:34.560> cockpits<00:04:35.280> with<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.940> many

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
like airplane cockpits with so many

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.330 
like airplane cockpits with so many
things<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.780> front<00:04:37.289> of<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.680> most<00:04:38.009> of<00:04:38.190> all

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
things in front of you and most of all

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.770 
things in front of you and most of all
they're<00:04:38.520> they're<00:04:38.789> not<00:04:38.940> really<00:04:39.240> necessary

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
they're they're not really necessary

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.050 
they're they're not really necessary
they're<00:04:39.960> very<00:04:40.259> distracting<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:40.889> a<00:04:41.310> driver<00:04:41.880> of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
they're very distracting for a driver of

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.610 
they're very distracting for a driver of
a<00:04:42.120> car<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.539> this<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:42.780> don't<00:04:42.960> need<00:04:43.319> to<00:04:43.530> have

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
a car like this you don't need to have

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.900 
a car like this you don't need to have
that<00:04:43.680> many<00:04:43.949> buttons<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.370> front<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.699> you<00:04:44.759> it's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that many buttons in front of you it's

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.480 
that many buttons in front of you it's
not<00:04:45.060> your<00:04:45.210> office<00:04:45.360> as<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.620> with<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.860> Formula

is<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:14.729> that<00:05:15.240> less<00:05:15.509> is<00:05:15.539> more<00:05:15.720> basically<00:05:16.650> get

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
is is that less is more basically get

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.350 
is is that less is more basically get
rid<00:05:16.949> of<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.280> unless<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.610> really<00:05:17.940> desperately

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
rid of it unless you really desperately

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.629 
rid of it unless you really desperately
need<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.870> use<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:19.949> then<00:05:20.099> it's<00:05:20.250> right<00:05:20.400> there

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
need to use it and then it's right there

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.450 
need to use it and then it's right there
at<00:05:20.699> you<00:05:20.849> at<00:05:21.270> your<00:05:21.449> fingertips<00:05:21.860> first<00:05:22.860> reaction

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
at you at your fingertips first reaction

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.610 
at you at your fingertips first reaction
I<00:05:23.610> think<00:05:23.729> of<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.270> anybody<00:05:25.169> would<00:05:25.349> see<00:05:25.500> the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
I think of it of anybody would see the

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.379 
I think of it of anybody would see the
car<00:05:25.860> going<00:05:26.190> down<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.550> road<00:05:26.639> I<00:05:26.699> think<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:27.180> sort

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
car going down the road I think is sort

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.839 
car going down the road I think is sort
of<00:05:27.650> it's<00:05:28.650> like<00:05:28.979> when<00:05:29.159> you<00:05:29.250> see<00:05:29.460> something<00:05:29.699> that

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
of it's like when you see something that

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.240 
of it's like when you see something that
you<00:05:29.969> didn't<00:05:30.570> expect<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.960> see<00:05:31.229> shopping<00:05:32.070> and

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
you didn't expect to see shopping and

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.279 
you didn't expect to see shopping and
you<00:05:32.430> desperately<00:05:32.849> want<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.659> at<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:34.110> moment

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
you desperately want it at that moment

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.839 
you desperately want it at that moment
and<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.620> go<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:34.949> buy<00:05:35.159> it<00:05:35.219> and<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.520> don't

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
and you go in to buy it and you don't

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.370 
and you go in to buy it and you don't
even<00:05:35.940> try<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.449> or<00:05:36.659> anything<00:05:36.840> like<00:05:37.080> that<00:05:37.110> you

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
even try it on or anything like that you

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.290 
even try it on or anything like that you
know<00:05:37.469> it's<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:37.680> stir<00:05:38.280> it<00:05:38.400> in<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.550> soul<00:05:38.759> Clare

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
know it's that stir it in the soul Clare

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.700 
know it's that stir it in the soul Clare
it's<00:05:39.419> not<00:05:39.539> really<00:05:39.840> about<00:05:39.930> trying<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.440> stir

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
it's not really about trying to stir

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.020 
it's not really about trying to stir
people's<00:05:41.070> souls<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.520> about<00:05:41.789> actually

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
people's souls is about actually

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.999 
people's souls is about actually
producing<00:05:42.630> their<00:05:43.259> professional<00:05:43.770> equipment

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
producing their professional equipment

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.890 
producing their professional equipment
but<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.340> think<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:44.759> that<00:05:44.909> element<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.719> making

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
but I think that that element of making

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.680 
but I think that that element of making
people<00:05:46.199> just<00:05:46.560> see<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.860> hear<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.969> feel<00:05:48.389> it

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
people just see it hear it and feel it

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.809 
people just see it hear it and feel it
that<00:05:49.020> that's<00:05:49.319> what<00:05:49.530> will<00:05:50.310> happen<00:05:50.430> I<00:05:50.669> think

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
that that's what will happen I think

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.230 
that that's what will happen I think
when<00:05:50.940> anybody<00:05:51.270> comes<00:05:51.449> with<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.690> car<00:05:51.870> that's

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
when anybody comes with the car that's

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.659 
when anybody comes with the car that's
consists<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:52.990> reaction<00:05:53.410> anyways<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:53.889> I<00:05:54.130> think

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
consists of reaction anyways but I think

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.670 
consists of reaction anyways but I think
when<00:05:55.240> somebody<00:05:55.389> sees<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.810> car<00:05:56.020> it's<00:05:56.349> gonna<00:05:56.530> be

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
when somebody sees the car it's gonna be

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.159 
when somebody sees the car it's gonna be
that<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.919> needed<00:05:57.220> reaction<00:05:57.910> not<00:05:58.539> only<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:58.840> want

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
that I needed reaction not only I want

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.830 
that I needed reaction not only I want
it<00:05:59.289> but<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.500> need<00:05:59.560> it
