makes<00:00:35.850> sense<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.630> laid<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> dry

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
makes sense and I laid out I'm in a dry

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.729 
makes sense and I laid out I'm in a dry
erase<00:00:38.219> board<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> very<00:00:39.649> moving<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
erase board in a very moving and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.420 
erase board in a very moving and
motivating<00:00:41.370> speech<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> did<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.260> there

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
motivating speech that I did up there

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.729 
motivating speech that I did up there
I'm<00:00:44.430> sure<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.850> many<00:00:45.000> people<00:00:45.270> are<00:00:45.360> moved

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
I'm sure so many people are moved

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.990 
I'm sure so many people are moved
anyways<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> lot<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> questions<00:00:48.210> about

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
anyways I get a lot of questions about

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.189 
anyways I get a lot of questions about
why<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> calorie

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
why I don't just think that the calorie

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.200 
why I don't just think that the calorie
is<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> calorie<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.370> calorie<00:00:56.899> idea<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.710> or

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
is a calorie is a calorie idea works or

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.540 
is a calorie is a calorie idea works or
why<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.109> best<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
why I don't think it's the best that's a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
why I don't think it's the best that's a
better<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> putting<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.809> best<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
better way of putting it the best way of

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
better way of putting it the best way of
doing<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.909> far<00:01:06.540> as<00:01:06.570> body<00:01:06.840> composition

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
doing things as far as body composition

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.910 
doing things as far as body composition
change<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.610> far<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.229> fitness<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.650> health

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and things like that so let me go into

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.300 
and things like that so let me go into
this<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:16.020> general<00:01:16.350> argument<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.830> that's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this the general argument is that's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070

the<00:02:42.209> most<00:02:42.239> efficient<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.439> put<00:02:44.159> on<00:02:44.280> muscle

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
the most efficient way to put on muscle

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.420 
the most efficient way to put on muscle
and<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.650> way<00:02:46.650> that's<00:02:46.919> going<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.159> give<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.400> the

and the way that's going to give you the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.979 
and the way that's going to give you the
greatest<00:02:47.760> amount<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.239> longevity<00:02:48.419> in<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
greatest amount of longevity in the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.640 
greatest amount of longevity in the
sport<00:02:49.379> my<00:02:50.250> idea<00:02:50.609> is<00:02:51.349> eating<00:02:52.349> carbohydrates

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
sport my idea is eating carbohydrates

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.119 
sport my idea is eating carbohydrates
when<00:02:53.219> you<00:02:53.340> are<00:02:53.489> insulin<00:02:54.120> sensitive<00:02:54.629> and

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
when you are insulin sensitive and

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.379 
when you are insulin sensitive and
focusing<00:02:56.129> on<00:02:56.280> eating<00:02:56.879> those<00:02:57.030> carbohydrates

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
focusing on eating those carbohydrates

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.080 
focusing on eating those carbohydrates
when<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:57.989> insulin<00:02:58.319> sensitive<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.219> that<00:02:59.849> will

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
when your insulin sensitive so that will

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.149 
when your insulin sensitive so that will
eventually<00:03:00.359> allow<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.260> eat<00:03:01.829> more

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
eventually allow you to eat more

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.770 
eventually allow you to eat more
carbohydrates<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:05.030> when<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.419> are

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
carbohydrates and so when you are

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.110 
carbohydrates and so when you are
looking<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.590> bulk<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> you're<00:03:08.549> looking<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
looking to bulk and you're looking to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.069 
looking to bulk and you're looking to
put<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:09.930> muscle<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.439> not<00:03:10.680> fat<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:12.329> creates<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
put on muscle and not fat this creates a

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.890 
put on muscle and not fat this creates a
much<00:03:13.739> more<00:03:14.010> efficient<00:03:14.609> way<00:03:14.819> for<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.299> do<00:03:15.629> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
much more efficient way for you to do so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.569 
much more efficient way for you to do so
and<00:03:16.079> I've<00:03:16.409> demonstrated<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.219> with<00:03:17.430> my

inflammation your body will eventually

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.490 
inflammation your body will eventually
react<00:04:54.550> negatively<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.420> those<00:04:55.750> nutrients

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
react negatively to those nutrients

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.690 
react negatively to those nutrients
because<00:04:57.870> one<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.410> hormonal<00:04:59.800> responses<00:05:00.460> that

because one the hormonal responses that

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.850 
because one the hormonal responses that
they<00:05:00.910> create<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:01.480> you're<00:05:02.440> constantly
