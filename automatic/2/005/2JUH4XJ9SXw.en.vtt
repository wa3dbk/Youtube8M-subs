00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:27.280 

and<00:03:15.770> every<00:03:16.770> produces<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> sound<00:03:17.760> quite<00:03:18.120> well

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.559 

so<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.250> all<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.400> would<00:03:29.730> say<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.329> very

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
so all in all I would say this is a very

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.520 
so all in all I would say this is a very
capable<00:03:30.959> Bluetooth<00:03:31.739> device<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.670> SMT<00:03:36.530> 5800

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
capable Bluetooth device so the SMT 5800

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.149 
capable Bluetooth device so the SMT 5800
did<00:03:37.709> real<00:03:37.920> well<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.189> all<00:03:38.549> these<00:03:38.730> devices<00:03:40.159> so

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
did real well with all these devices so

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.190 
did real well with all these devices so
it's<00:03:41.400> Bluetooth<00:03:41.609> capability<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:42.840> say<00:03:43.049> is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it's Bluetooth capability I would say is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
it's Bluetooth capability I would say is
excellent<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:45.120> also<00:03:45.299> connects<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:47.099> laptops<00:03:47.939> in
