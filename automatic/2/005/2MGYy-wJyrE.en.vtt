00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.639
 today we are here on the old track 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.520
 of the Monza track to celebrate a 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.039
 50 years birthday for a car 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 they may seem many but not when 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.890
 they are laden with prestige of glory and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 sports history in 1963 carlo abarth is 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.119
 already a famous character and decides to 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.789
 transforming the fiat utility car to 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.489
 excellence the 500 in a small racing car 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.710
 so with few mechanical modifications the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.409
 big hub gives birth to something more than 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.390
 a simple elaboration develops the 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:45.260
 passion for racing even in those who don't 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.989
 he could afford that debut 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.480
 of the 595 takes place officially in the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.850
 September 1963 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.649
 in reality abarth had already tested the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.690
 quality of a possible elaboration 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.989
 on the small fiat subcompact for la 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.090
 precision October 15, 1957 when 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.940
 just a hundred of them in Monza 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.310
 abarth processing from 22 horses exceeded 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 the threshold of 100 per hour a few months 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.660
 later with an engine equipped with the famous 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 slipper pistons and a power of 20 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.099
 6 horses another 500 developed by 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.349
 scorpion was speeding continuously 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:21.229
 for a week of rehearsal by touching the 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:25.190
 110 per hour and winning six firsts 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.819
 of class to 595 ss that we try today to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.380
 a specimen from 1970 set up on 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.380
 body of the 500 f 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.750
 I 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.270
 the heart of the little abarth came 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.270
 totally revised only in practice 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.480
 run remains unchanged 70 mm from 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.910
 essay passes to 73.5 from which precisely the 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.910
 displacement of 595 cc 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.110
 the success of the 595 and immediately immediate 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.940
 and forces carlo abarth to set up 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.760
 in his company a small chain of 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.430
 mounting 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.350
 this to arrive at a rate of 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.970
 250 monthly copies to arrive at 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.530
 produce it and immediately a hundred to have 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.240
 homologation in the tourism category 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.240
 up to 600 cc 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 from 595, the cafÃ© racer par excellence 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.220
 attracts the attention of many 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 passionate 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.690
 the car cost in 1963 595 thousand lire 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.630
 here is one set up 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.480
 transformation box or better two 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.080
 the first includes what is necessary for 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.820
 the metamorphosis from 500 to 595 to the modica 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.430
 figure of 109 thousand lire 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.630
 the second is simplified to maintain 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.630
 the cylinder capacity unchanged 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.770
 wow 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.020
 to see today is tenderness but to drive 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.870
 absolutely fun and makes you feel 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.240
 a real pilot because interiors are from 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.290
 leave sport starting with 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.230
 mythical instrumentation the track of 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.630
 monza is the ideal terrain for 595 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.340
 thanks to the proverbial reliability of the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.350
 two-cylinder engine developed by the magician 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.350
 Austrian top speed is 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.750
 keeps it practically everywhere 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.430
 soon the 595 has become synonymous 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.410
 of races with little money available 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 and a lot of passion 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.700
 the typical car to use for work 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.740
 during the week and on track in 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.740
 weekend without having to change anything 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.180
 the interior furnishing manifests the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.310
 classic minimalist spirit of the house 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.320
 Turin with some touch of sportiness 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.390
 you have to adapt to the driving position 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.390
 ideal for small people 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.160
 the curves are cross and delight of the 595 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.709
 in front there is a crossbow 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.420
 posteriorly of the triangular arms but 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.840
 nothing to do with suspensions e 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.840
 sports suspension 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.350
 when the adventure of carlo a barre has 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.150
 very much represented carlo bar 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.970
 a great fan of engines 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.490
 initially of motorcycles and then of 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.270
 cars but wanted to create for the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.729
 Italians mainly from models of use 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.530
 quite common as five hundred e 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.419
 six hundred create the cars that 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.820
 they could be faster but they could 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.280
 also be sure and they could 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.009
 also create the possibility of going into 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.130
 track and show up on the track and created 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.889
 also many many pilots who were born 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.479
 with his machines and then switched to 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.479
 superior category cars 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.370
 deafening steering noise vibrations e 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.710
 dancers brakes change synchronized 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.349
 precarious stability defects 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.029
 absolutely not indeed tremendous pleasure 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.729
 for those lucky enough to collect 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.529
 one of being able to use it to be admired 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.020
 rallies and to drive on the track 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.020
 in short, 50 years brought very very well
