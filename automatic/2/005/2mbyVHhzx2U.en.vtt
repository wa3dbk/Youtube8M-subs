personally I don't think it will be
possible<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.490> shouldn't<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.030> possible<00:01:51.570> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
at this point will not only be immersion

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
at this point will not only be immersion
braking<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.869> also<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.380> frustrating<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
braking but also very frustrating and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.310 
braking but also very frustrating and
unfair<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> chances<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.840> you'd

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
unfair because the chances are you'd

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
unfair because the chances are you'd
have<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.619> give<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.369> mission<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.880> deal

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
have to give up on the mission to deal

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.520 
have to give up on the mission to deal
with<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> night<00:02:06.450> hunter<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.079> start<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
with a night hunter and then start it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229 
with a night hunter and then start it
all<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:07.680> again<00:02:08.069> after<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.610> defeat<00:02:08.789> him

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
all over again after you defeat him

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.059 
all over again after you defeat him
so<00:02:09.450> hopefully<00:02:09.660> techline<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.830> mind

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so hopefully techline have this in mind

but<00:02:33.209> when<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> look<00:02:33.659> at<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> first<00:02:34.110> footage<00:02:34.349> we

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
but when I look at the first footage we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.589 
but when I look at the first footage we
got<00:02:34.799> from<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> game<00:02:35.400> mode<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.760> question<00:02:36.390> if

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
got from this game mode I question if

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.720 
got from this game mode I question if
there<00:02:36.840> are<00:02:36.989> limitations<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.799> this<00:02:38.099> when<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
there are limitations to this when the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
there are limitations to this when the
demo<00:02:38.909> starts<00:02:39.329> they're<00:02:39.540> showing<00:02:39.959> off<00:02:40.110> co-op

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
demo starts they're showing off co-op

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.170 
demo starts they're showing off co-op
and<00:02:40.769> crafted<00:02:41.159> weapons<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and crafted weapons but then there's a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.030 
and crafted weapons but then there's a
hard<00:02:42.450> cut<00:02:42.690> when<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:42.989> night<00:02:43.290> hunter<00:02:43.470> invades

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
hard cut when the night hunter invades

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.339 
hard cut when the night hunter invades
and<00:02:44.340> suddenly<00:02:45.030> both<00:02:45.390> characters<00:02:45.930> are<00:02:46.109> just

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
and suddenly both characters are just

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.740 
and suddenly both characters are just
holding<00:02:46.590> regular<00:02:46.980> hammers<00:02:47.760> now<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.510> might<00:02:48.690> be

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
holding regular hammers now it might be

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.630 
holding regular hammers now it might be
that<00:02:48.900> when<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.440> footage<00:02:49.680> cuts<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
that when the footage cuts to the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.460 
that when the footage cuts to the
invasion<00:02:51.150> we're<00:02:51.390> watching<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.019> different

but<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.599> wonder<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.019> there's<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.470> limitation<00:02:55.890> on

but I wonder if there's a limitation on

also seen this in the single-player on

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.110 
also seen this in the single-player on
the<00:03:43.379> gameplay<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.889> what<00:03:44.040> we<00:03:44.160> got<00:03:44.370> two<00:03:44.760> years

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
the gameplay down what we got two years

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.970 
the gameplay down what we got two years
ago<00:03:45.419> but<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> developers<00:03:46.530> seem<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.889> be

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
ago but the developers seem to be

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.920 
ago but the developers seem to be
talking<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.760> ability<00:03:48.269> as<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.720> it's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
talking about this ability as if it's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.839

unique<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.349> this<00:03:49.650> game-mode<00:03:49.949> so<00:03:50.609> maybe

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
unique to this game-mode so maybe

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.400 
unique to this game-mode so maybe

seems<00:06:08.210> that<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.480> can<00:06:08.660> use<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.050> grappling

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
seems that you can use the grappling

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.590 
seems that you can use the grappling
hook<00:06:09.530> on<00:06:09.890> a<00:06:09.950> player<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.610> then<00:06:10.760> go<00:06:11.030> into<00:06:11.360> the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
hook on a player and then go into the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.630 
hook on a player and then go into the
pouncing<00:06:12.020> animation<00:06:12.530> or<00:06:12.650> just<00:06:13.130> push<00:06:13.340> him<00:06:13.520> and

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
pouncing animation or just push him and

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.550 
pouncing animation or just push him and
that<00:06:13.910> sounds<00:06:14.450> really<00:06:14.750> cool<00:06:14.900> now<00:06:15.200> if<00:06:15.320> you<00:06:15.440> do

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
that sounds really cool now if you do

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.020 
that sounds really cool now if you do
get<00:06:15.710> caught<00:06:15.919> out<00:06:16.100> by<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.280> players<00:06:16.580> if<00:06:16.880> they

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
get caught out by the players if they

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.240 
get caught out by the players if they
see<00:06:17.090> you<00:06:17.450> and<00:06:17.630> point<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.990> UV<00:06:18.290> flashlight<00:06:18.800> at<00:06:19.010> you

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
see you and point a UV flashlight at you

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.980 
see you and point a UV flashlight at you
they<00:06:19.669> will<00:06:19.790> probably<00:06:20.090> try<00:06:20.540> to<00:06:20.570> kill<00:06:20.840> you

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
they will probably try to kill you

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.659 
they will probably try to kill you
because<00:06:21.140> while<00:06:21.560> you're<00:06:21.770> responding<00:06:22.250> they<00:06:22.490> can

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
because while you're responding they can

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.610 
because while you're responding they can
go<00:06:22.820> for<00:06:23.090> the<00:06:23.180> hives<00:06:23.419> without<00:06:23.840> a<00:06:23.870> problem<00:06:24.169> but

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
go for the hives without a problem but

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.260 
go for the hives without a problem but
in<00:06:24.710> that<00:06:24.830> situation<00:06:25.550> if<00:06:25.700> you<00:06:25.850> get<00:06:26.000> caught<00:06:26.240> out

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
in that situation if you get caught out

in that situation if you get caught out
and<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:26.720> can't<00:06:26.990> run<00:06:27.230> away<00:06:27.380> you<00:06:27.530> can<00:06:27.830> still<00:06:27.950> use

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
and you can't run away you can still use

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.460 
and you can't run away you can still use
a<00:06:28.400> ground<00:06:28.850> pound<00:06:29.210> which<00:06:29.780> will<00:06:29.960> stagger<00:06:30.260> all
