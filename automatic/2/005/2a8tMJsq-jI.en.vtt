00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.540
 we salute everyone if they act credit and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:21.380
 we find ourselves for a small inverse on 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:24.510
 the map of aramon xiaochao guy in front 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.230
 from me I have a small castle 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.950
 who wants barrier islands with a small 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:38.160
 little safe what I mean man for 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:41.580
 each at the barriers and he 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.470
 that's what I could not read there 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.210
 a good moment 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.210
 that's what 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.630
 Dec 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.450
 Why 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.950
 I 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.430
 my mac there is plenty of boxing 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.430
 at camping 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.979
 exhaustion 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.600
 we blame bing is the box 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.770
 every bone but a minute to disappear 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 maybe not spent a minute passing 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.840
 comfortable in this game but well knows 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 never and actually there that means that at 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.940
 a minute 52 years they're coming back the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.659
 box 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.810
 so I could possibly 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.810
 third thing 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.140
 so we'll say that super 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.530
 fucking but full of votes 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.530
 this trio 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.720
 g
