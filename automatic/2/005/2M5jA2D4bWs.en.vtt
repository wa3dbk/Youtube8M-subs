00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
possessed as I like to call it but I

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.900 
possessed as I like to call it but I
guess<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> nice<00:00:34.829> segue<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> main

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
guess that's a nice segue into the main

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.580 
guess that's a nice segue into the main
reason<00:00:36.239> why<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.020> video<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
reason why I want to make this video and
that<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.550> I've<00:00:38.820> been<00:00:39.420> receiving

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that is because I've been receiving

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
yourself it's definitely nice to have

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.469 
yourself it's definitely nice to have
access<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.369> early<00:01:32.880> around<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> game

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
access to that early around in the game

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
access to that early around in the game
so<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> indeed<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.950> case<00:01:35.159> you're

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so if that is indeed your case you're

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.350 
so if that is indeed your case you're
having<00:01:35.460> trouble<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.240> not

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
having trouble because you're not

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
having trouble because you're not
maintaining<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.990> gear<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> great

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
maintaining your gear this is a great

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
maintaining your gear this is a great
video<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> come<00:01:38.939> across<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> fail<00:01:40.380> my

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
video to come across as I fail my

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.819 
video to come across as I fail my
platforming<00:01:41.400> epically<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.829> think

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
platforming epically here I just I think

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
platforming epically here I just I think
the<00:01:43.920> platforming<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.729> game<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.750> so

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the platforming in this game is just so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.260 
the platforming in this game is just so
clunky<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.040> guess<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.700> could<00:01:47.970> just

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
clunky but I guess that that could just

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
clunky but I guess that that could just
be<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.420> topic<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> different<00:01:49.590> video<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.369> would

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
be a topic for a different video I would

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.480 
be a topic for a different video I would
take<00:01:51.149> way<00:01:51.360> too<00:01:51.420> long<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.810> anyways<00:01:52.490> these

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
take way too long but anyways these

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490 
take way too long but anyways these
blades<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.420> easy<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.170> miss

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
blades are actually really easy to miss

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.959 
blades are actually really easy to miss
it<00:01:55.829> may<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.100> look<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.340> they're<00:01:56.640> easy<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it may not look like they're easy to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
it may not look like they're easy to
miss<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.450> video<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.619> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
miss in this video but they are if you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
miss in this video but they are if you
miss<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.790> corruption<00:02:00.450> crystal<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.530> will

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
miss that corruption crystal you will

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.990 
miss that corruption crystal you will
have<00:02:01.770> no<00:02:01.979> idea<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.700> even<00:02:02.969> there

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
have no idea that it's even there

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
have no idea that it's even there
obviously<00:02:03.719> because<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.320> said<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.590> missed

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
obviously because I just said you missed

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
obviously because I just said you missed
it<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.640> come<00:02:05.820> into<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.149> room<00:02:06.390> grab

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it but if you come into this room grab

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.449 
it but if you come into this room grab
this<00:02:07.409> shadow<00:02:07.710> bomb<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.340> actually

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
this shadow bomb and you can actually

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.669 
this shadow bomb and you can actually
run<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.209> platform<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.440> need

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
run up to that platform you don't need

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.190 
run up to that platform you don't need
this<00:02:10.920> um<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.270> need<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> death<00:02:12.690> grip<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this um you don't need the death grip to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.000 
this um you don't need the death grip to
grab<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

than you know a regular Inferno damage
that<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.010> stat<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.489> would<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.849> on<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.330> pair<00:02:39.510> of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that a stat you would see on a pair of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.620 
that a stat you would see on a pair of
sites<00:02:39.900> or<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.230> secondary<00:02:41.010> weapon<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:42.090> has<00:02:42.420> the

sites or a secondary weapon this has the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.720 
sites or a secondary weapon this has the
effect<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.440> fire<00:02:43.709> catching<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> multiple

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
effect of the fire catching to multiple

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.210 
effect of the fire catching to multiple
enemies<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.360> any<00:02:45.660> enemies<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.470> proximity<00:02:46.980> to

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
enemies so any enemies in proximity to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.830 
enemies so any enemies in proximity to
the<00:02:47.400> original<00:02:48.030> enemy<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> were<00:02:48.569> attacking

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the original enemy you were attacking

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
the original enemy you were attacking
will<00:02:49.140> catch<00:02:49.319> fire<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.830> well<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.819> said

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
will catch fire as well so like I said

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.640 
will catch fire as well so like I said
it's<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.299> really<00:02:51.540> good<00:02:51.840> weapon<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.319> fill<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's a really good weapon to fill the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680 
it's a really good weapon to fill the
void<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:52.890> between<00:02:53.209> higher-level<00:02:54.209> weapon

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
void in between higher-level weapon

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.809
