00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.260
 hello I'm francisco did it one more time and 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.500
 we are still here in the mobile world 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.439
 congress 2015 of barcelona this time for 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.740
 from the micro stand we were introduced 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:26.130
 a clock smells like bleu 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.380
 Built -in Android operating system 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.700
 4.2 is a likely watch that features 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.910
 two physical buttons on your part 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.640
 right and good is a good talk that 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.500
 logically has a clock with 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
 step counter away from 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 calories is independent or can be 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.960
 link to a smartphone 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.600
 android or can be used through 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 card placement sim card has 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.330
 3g connectivity bluetooth 4.0 features 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.510
 gps 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.300
 logically has wifi with control 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.810
 of voice and reminders through 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 invitations 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.430
 one of the most interesting things this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.550
 watch that as you can check wheel 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 pure and hard android is your battery that 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.310
 they assure us that it lasts 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 a little more than three days if we enter 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.200
 the phone's interface still having a 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.740
 tiny keyboard is very practical and 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.960
 well we detect its touch screen 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.939
 quickly where we have made the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.060
 Pressing the button below serves to 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 go back also well as well 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.679
 you see and we continue in the drawer of 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.329
 applications let's see the 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.110
 side scrolling that has that is 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.240
 logically 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.940
 like any android terminal account 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.590
 with the agenda has a calendar as 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.380
 you see here has the own store of 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.300
 play is here asks us to put a 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.860
 but I already tell you that it is a clock 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.470
 intelligent from which we will be able to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.630
 install applications if we lower the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.180
 curtain of limitations we can see the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 wifi notification and if we enter here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.710
 let's see how hard android is pure 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.030
 where we have the you see the level of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.459
 battery signal wifi wifi and so on 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 Well at the moment it has not been commented if 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.230
 this watch will reach the Spanish market 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.540
 but hey it's a very interesting idea to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 keep in mind given the last and the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.120
 recent fashion of these variables with 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 operating system android web in this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.970
 Case is the Android operating system 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.300
 own android 4 points 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.820
 and I tell you that the clock allows its 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.680
 function through pairs or linkage to 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.500
 an intelligent smartphone with system 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.800
 operative android or autonomously 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.840
 by entering a card 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.660
 sim like I said before you have 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.850
 3g connectivity and a battery that 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.850
 Hold a little over three days 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 ah
