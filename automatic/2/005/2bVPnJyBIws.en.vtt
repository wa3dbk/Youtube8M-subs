00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
very breathless you have to work it read

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.789 
very breathless you have to work it read
hard<00:02:31.579> it's<00:02:32.420> alright<00:02:32.810> at<00:02:32.959> urban<00:02:33.319> speeds<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
hard it's alright at urban speeds it

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.100 
hard it's alright at urban speeds it
picks<00:02:34.010> up<00:02:34.129> okay<00:02:34.519> but<00:02:34.780> anything<00:02:35.780> more<00:02:35.959> than

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
picks up okay but anything more than

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.539 
picks up okay but anything more than
that<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:36.680> struggles<00:02:37.190> the

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
that and it really struggles the

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.129 
that and it really struggles the
handling<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.060> alright<00:02:38.359> but<00:02:38.569> it's<00:02:38.720> let<00:02:38.959> them

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
handling is alright but it's let them

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.870 
handling is alright but it's let them
buy<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.350> steering<00:02:39.859> which<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.160> really<00:02:40.670> really

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
buy the steering which is really really

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.199 
buy the steering which is really really
disconnected<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.750> numb<00:02:41.989> however<00:02:42.889> that<00:02:43.760> is

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
disconnected and numb however that is

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.210 
disconnected and numb however that is
going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.750> change<00:02:44.989> for<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.230> UK<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.889> there

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
going to change for the UK because there

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.069 
going to change for the UK because there
is<00:02:46.310> UK<00:02:46.609> specific<00:02:47.120> steering<00:02:47.450> settings<00:02:47.840> which

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
is UK specific steering settings which

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.960 
is UK specific steering settings which
we<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.680> tried<00:02:48.920> yet<00:02:49.220> even<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.790> ride

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970

a bit bumpy over bigger intrusions and

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.050 
a bit bumpy over bigger intrusions and
it<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.380> skip<00:02:54.739> quite<00:02:55.040> disconcertingly<00:02:55.819> if

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
it can skip quite disconcertingly if

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.819 
it can skip quite disconcertingly if

touchscreen<00:03:32.270> which<00:03:33.270> has<00:03:33.420> got<00:03:33.570> really<00:03:33.930> good

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
touchscreen which has got really good

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.650 
touchscreen which has got really good
smartphone<00:03:34.560> integration<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
smartphone integration and I think the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.060 
smartphone integration and I think the
Adams<00:03:36.930> target<00:03:37.350> audience<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:37.830> really

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
Adams target audience will really

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.100 
Adams target audience will really
appreciate<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.510> even<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> sat-nav

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
appreciate that so even the sat-nav

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.900 
appreciate that so even the sat-nav
software<00:03:40.710> is<00:03:40.890> based<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.400> phone<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.880> not

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
software is based on the phone and not

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.830 
software is based on the phone and not
in<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.390> car

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
in the car

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.570 
in the car
so<00:03:43.290> obviously<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.770> updates<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:44.490> you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
so obviously that updates when you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.880 
so obviously that updates when you
