basically an issue where if you try to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.310 
basically an issue where if you try to
launch<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.300> game<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.719> come<00:00:12.900> up<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.170> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
launch the game it will come up with a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.919 
launch the game it will come up with a
configuration<00:00:14.070> window<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.780> basically<00:00:15.780> what

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
configuration window and basically what

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.820 
configuration window and basically what
happens<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.440> from<00:00:17.130> then<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.880> game<00:00:18.060> crashes

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
happens is from then on the game crashes

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.439 
happens is from then on the game crashes
it<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.070> won't<00:00:20.310> get<00:00:20.460> past<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.910> configuration

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it just won't get past the configuration

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.990 
it just won't get past the configuration
the<00:00:21.510> configuration<00:00:21.779> itself<00:00:22.470> will<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:23.000> crash

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the configuration itself will just crash

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
the configuration itself will just crash
and<00:00:25.070> I've<00:00:26.070> tried<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> couple<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.820> ways<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
and I've tried a couple of ways to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970 
and I've tried a couple of ways to
basically<00:00:27.779> fix<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> best<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
basically fix this and the best one I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.209 
basically fix this and the best one I
found<00:00:29.310> I'll<00:00:29.580> show<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> moment<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:31.219> I've

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
found I'll show you in a moment but I've

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.790 
found I'll show you in a moment but I've
also<00:00:32.460> tried<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.329> I'll<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.230> back<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
also tried to I'll just go back for a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040 
also tried to I'll just go back for a
moment<00:00:34.950> I've<00:00:35.640> tried<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> basically<00:00:36.540> make<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
moment I've tried to basically make the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.270 
moment I've tried to basically make the
configuration<00:00:37.520> compatible<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.790> Windows<00:00:40.280> XP

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
configuration compatible for Windows XP

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.830 
configuration compatible for Windows XP
and<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.270> doesn't

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and that kind of thing it just doesn't

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.650 
and that kind of thing it just doesn't
work<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.440> my<00:00:43.590> system<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.480> there<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
work for my system so there is a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.709 
work for my system so there is a
slightly<00:00:45.989> better<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.610> what<00:00:47.610> I'll<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> I'm

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
slightly better way what I'll do is I'm

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.200 
slightly better way what I'll do is I'm
going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> delete<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.789> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
going to delete what I just did so I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
going to delete what I just did so I
don't<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> scroll<00:00:52.860> down

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
don't like I'm just going to scroll down

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.029 
don't like I'm just going to scroll down
and<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> believe<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.020> okay<00:00:55.559> what

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and so I believe it's that one okay what

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.260 
and so I believe it's that one okay what
we're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.489> however<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.030> going
