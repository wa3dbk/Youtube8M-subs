00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.590
 days that I leave so frankly 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 it's not bad so I'm not settling 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.289
 still at the best of performances but 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.090
 I am very happy for now 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:38.399
 I hope for me that's what I'm looking for 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.980

 to see in black your Sardinian is not bad 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.439
 and there I have no security on me so 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 in fact as much to buy 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.780
 it's definitely not worth it unless 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.430
