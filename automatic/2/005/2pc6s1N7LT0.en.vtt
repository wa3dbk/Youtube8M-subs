now by the way I'm you're a smart guy

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.470 
now by the way I'm you're a smart guy
gave<00:00:34.200> me<00:00:34.230> five<00:00:34.829> years<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:36.030> read<00:00:36.270> your

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
gave me five years and we will read your

coming<00:00:38.309> very<00:00:38.640> fast<00:00:38.700> how's<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.570> simple<00:00:39.989> as

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
coming very fast how's it as simple as

coming very fast how's it as simple as
saying<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.559> computer<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> literally<00:00:42.239> reading

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
your mind in some sense yes and you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
your mind in some sense yes and you
don't<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> Las<00:00:45.870> Vegas<00:00:46.320> magician<00:00:46.980> or

is we now have computers that can

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.189 
is we now have computers that can

know<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:04.799> thinking<00:01:05.309> use<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
know what you're thinking use that to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
know what you're thinking use that to
energize<00:01:06.720> machines<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.680> wheelchairs<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
energize machines like wheelchairs and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.250 
energize machines like wheelchairs and
that's<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> beginning<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.930> know<00:01:10.080> we're

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that's just the beginning you know we're

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.600 
that's just the beginning you know we're
looking<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.680> pictures<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.010> might<00:01:11.430> see

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
looking at some pictures here might see

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.710 
looking at some pictures here might see
video<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> moment<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
video in a moment here this is the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.750 
video in a moment here this is the
Toyota<00:01:13.229> mechanism<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> feedback

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
Toyota mechanism and the feedback

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.170 
Toyota mechanism and the feedback
happens<00:01:15.479> within<00:01:15.710> 125<00:01:16.710> milliseconds<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
happens within 125 milliseconds which is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
happens within 125 milliseconds which is
about<00:01:18.450> tenth<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> second<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.650> second

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
about tenth of a second to the second

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
about tenth of a second to the second
just<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:20.640> fast<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.600> fast<00:01:21.720> we've

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
just like that's fast very fast we've

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.960 
just like that's fast very fast we've
never<00:01:22.290> been<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.770> before<00:01:22.920> yeah<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
never been there before yeah this is a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.749 
never been there before yeah this is a
breakthrough<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> game<00:01:24.840> changer<00:01:25.290> because

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
breakthrough it's a game changer because

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.039 
breakthrough it's a game changer because
commercialization<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> technology<00:01:27.750> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
commercialization of this technology is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
commercialization of this technology is
coming<00:01:28.560> we've<00:01:29.159> had<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> technology<00:01:30.150> but

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
coming we've had this technology but

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.940 
coming we've had this technology but
it's<00:01:30.420> clunky<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.049> takes<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:31.650> it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it's clunky it takes time it's

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's clunky it takes time it's
frustrating<00:01:32.579> who<00:01:32.850> wants<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
frustrating who wants to use it this is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
frustrating who wants to use it this is
fast<00:01:34.650> convenient<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> Machine<00:01:35.970> learns

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
fast convenient and the Machine learns

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.649 
fast convenient and the Machine learns
it<00:01:37.110> learns<00:01:37.500> after<00:01:38.040> every<00:01:38.310> trial<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it learns after every trial so in the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.910 
it learns after every trial so in the
future<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.200> elderly<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.890> a

telling awake before before we go there

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840 
telling awake before before we go there
mark<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> shot<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.640> top<00:01:47.820> of

this guy's head literally the hat that
he's<00:01:50.310> wearing<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.759> there<00:01:50.970> yeah<00:01:51.720> wait<00:01:52.229> for

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
he's wearing right there yeah wait for

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
he's wearing right there yeah wait for
in<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> moment<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:52.920> these<00:01:53.310> red<00:01:53.880> rings<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.479> top

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
in a moment here these red rings on top

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
in a moment here these red rings on top
of<00:01:54.840> his<00:01:54.960> head<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> they're<00:01:56.729> little

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of his head what is that they're little

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
of his head what is that they're little
electrodes<00:01:57.659> tube8<00:01:58.079> wires<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.680> basically

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
electrodes tube8 wires that basically

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
electrodes tube8 wires that basically
pick<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> electric<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.299> magnetic<00:02:00.479> fields

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
pick up the electric and magnetic fields

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.830 
pick up the electric and magnetic fields
at<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.380> brain<00:02:01.649> normally<00:02:02.130> admits<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.360> brain

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
at the brain normally admits the brain

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.990 
at the brain normally admits the brain
normally<00:02:04.110> has<00:02:04.530> brain<00:02:04.829> waves<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.640> emit

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
normally has brain waves that we emit

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
normally has brain waves that we emit
but<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.299> very<00:02:06.329> faint<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.500> these

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but they're very faint so these

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.219 
but they're very faint so these
electrons<00:02:07.680> pick<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:08.819> brainwaves

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
electrons pick up these brainwaves

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.990 
electrons pick up these brainwaves
computers<00:02:10.229> massage<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.280> data

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
computers massage the data

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540 
computers massage the data
nice<00:02:12.270> patterns<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.620> when<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> think<00:02:14.190> left

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
nice patterns so when you think left

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.210 
nice patterns so when you think left
right<00:02:15.090> forward<00:02:15.540> backward<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.590> can<00:02:16.770> translate

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
right forward backward it can translate

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.850 
right forward backward it can translate
these<00:02:17.460> things<00:02:17.910> into<00:02:18.330> mechanical<00:02:19.290> motion<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.830> I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
these things into mechanical motion so I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.460 
these things into mechanical motion so I
said<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.340> forward<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:20.940> goes<00:02:21.480> forward<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
said go forward that goes forward and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.170 
said go forward that goes forward and
I'm<00:02:22.650> thinking<00:02:22.950> when<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> go<00:02:23.400> over<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:24.030> goes

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
I'm thinking when I go over here it goes

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.850 
I'm thinking when I go over here it goes
over<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.990> somehow<00:02:25.260> when<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.590> come

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
over there and somehow when they come

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
over there and somehow when they come
back<00:02:25.980> over<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:27.030> goes<00:02:27.240> i<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.690> it's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
back over here it goes i think it's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
back over here it goes i think it's
phenomenal<00:02:28.440> that's<00:02:28.740> right<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.459> be

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
phenomenal that's right you have to be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.370 
phenomenal that's right you have to be
trained<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.990> there's<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
trained to do this but there's going to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.750 
trained to do this but there's going to
be<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.500> huge<00:02:31.740> market<00:02:32.250> think<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.520> all<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
be a huge market think of all the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.120 
be a huge market think of all the
elderly<00:02:33.240> who<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.080> live<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.530> telepathic

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
elderly who want to live in a telepathic

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.010 
elderly who want to live in a telepathic
out<00:02:35.310> two<00:02:35.880> things<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.209> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.390> put<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
screen the ass emo this was developed in

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
screen the ass emo this was developed in
Japan<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.870> from<00:02:40.050> Honda<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.770> did<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
Japan to this is from Honda and did it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.640 
Japan to this is from Honda and did it
work<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.910> way<00:02:41.940> or<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.350> honda

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
work that way or this way the honda

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040 
work that way or this way the honda
machine<00:02:44.010> allows<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.330> moving<00:02:45.750> your

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
machine allows you to think moving your

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.500 
machine allows you to think moving your
hands<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.709> alarms<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.340> then<00:02:47.520> as<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.150> mobile

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
hands and alarms and then as a mobile

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.710 
hands and alarms and then as a mobile
also<00:02:49.080> move<00:02:49.500> its<00:02:49.830> arms<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.180> way<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.420> could

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
also move its arms in this way you could

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.010 
also move its arms in this way you could
control<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> robot<00:02:52.650> nurse<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.280> example<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
control a robot nurse for example so the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.620 
control a robot nurse for example so the
robot<00:02:55.830> will<00:02:56.040> come<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.610> basically<00:02:57.060> do

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
robot will come and basically do

robot will come and basically do
whatever<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.080> want<00:02:58.320> just<00:02:58.410> by<00:02:58.709> drinking

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
whatever you want just by drinking

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.310 
whatever you want just by drinking
you're<00:02:59.400> transferring<00:03:00.239> your<00:03:00.480> thoughts<00:03:00.840> to

you're transferring your thoughts to

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.770 
you're transferring your thoughts to
another<00:03:02.160> robot<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.820> do<00:03:02.940> something<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.570> you

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
another robot to do something for you

terms of revenue games can be played

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.020 
terms of revenue games can be played
just<00:03:34.620> by<00:03:34.860> thinking<00:03:34.920> about<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.850> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
just by thinking about it so this is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.360 
just by thinking about it so this is
just<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> first<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.810> many<00:03:36.930> video<00:03:37.620> games<00:03:37.709> which

just the first of many video games which

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.789 
just the first of many video games which
can<00:03:38.580> then<00:03:38.610> be<00:03:38.820> controlled<00:03:39.420> by<00:03:39.570> kids<00:03:39.930> thinking

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
can then be controlled by kids thinking

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.319 
can then be controlled by kids thinking
about<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.220> now<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.640> know<00:03:41.850> you're<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> big

brain<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.700> principle<00:04:41.420> we<00:04:41.600> already<00:04:42.020> have<00:04:42.170> cars

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
brain in principle we already have cars

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.890

that<00:04:42.650> can<00:04:42.740> drive<00:04:42.800> themselves<00:04:43.220> by<00:04:43.850> GPS<00:04:44.480> system

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that can drive themselves by GPS system

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.080 
that can drive themselves by GPS system
but<00:04:45.410> they<00:04:45.530> have<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.800> know<00:04:45.920> where<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.160> go<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.060> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
but they have to know where to go so you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.300 
but they have to know where to go so you
can<00:04:47.180> have<00:04:47.420> a<00:04:47.450> person<00:04:47.960> control<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.830> GPS

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
can have a person control the GPS

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.210 
can have a person control the GPS
monitor<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.060> of<00:04:50.660> course<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.350> control<00:04:52.070> the
