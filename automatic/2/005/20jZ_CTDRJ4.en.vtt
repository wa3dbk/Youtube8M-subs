00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 those on the right that we give to the right 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.340
 now as an economical with ixe 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.369
 manually 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.900
 does not expose is expelled is solved but 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.900
 without cams without brakes 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.720
 now we will see also calm is 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.720
 say do not go 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.960
 entering very fast says night 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.960
 This is the double clutch 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.770
 is the police then if you want we give a 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.770
 turn around a bit 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.869
 where 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 but 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.540
 i 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.540
 in the commitment at least 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.670
 we also see 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.750
 and it took to recover 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 and without needing to change here 2 no 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.700
 you need it so it keeps you for a 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.229
 time if you are not going to use it 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.220
 change the moment that they a while that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.220
 do not change with the cams 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.810
 and the real changes 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.580
 if you want it feel manual sliding 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.580
 with this m 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.280
 far in perspective follows then wants 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.709
 say the start stop bales is not going well 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.709
 although in real composition mode 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:42.180
 so 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 a luxury car and the samples of these 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 cars 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.890
 because the kit is on the east and below the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.890
 all 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.040
 and the other way around 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.470
 she has untied now and with the carafe 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.379
 If you do not want to stop 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.430
 I'm fast 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.430
 because it comes to this engine 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.250
 from the left 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.250
 on the left 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.220
 they are not equal to the others with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.220
 they activate the normal start 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.299
 because if it was spent on the battery or 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.299
 gas
