00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.650
 well this and a half I hope you 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.369
 be well car - sonic wings of coulx 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.200
 young people find themselves for a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.470
 new video on x shape but wrongly 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.500
 2015 for a fashion test and today 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.440
 I will introduce you to the box 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.090
 international 1455 so here's what it 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.830
 looks in the game and up to 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.250
 right you can see what they 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.320
 look like real so it's a 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.900
 tractor so this impact rather excuse 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.000
 me so it exists without the lift and 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.860
 it exists with lift and it even has a 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.729
 small PTO with so that's 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.350
 rather not bad 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.210
 so that's so it's a pack he 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.839
 will have to extract so the link will be in 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 the description 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.250
 if some want to download it so 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.780
 we'll have a quick tour of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.940
 tractor calls us it's small 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 tractors but who are frankly very 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.460
 very well detailed so I know they 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.260
 existed mixmaster surfer 2013 and so 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.600
 they were reconverted for the 15th and 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.119
 they are frankly very very good 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.680
 detailed very very well done so that's it 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.850
 so we will immediately go see in 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.049
 the choice of a little bit their 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.729
 characteristics 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.509
 so they are obviously of a fashion 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.280
 and they still have nothing to do with it 145 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.500
 horses so it's not bad at all when 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.890
 even so here is the one without lifting 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.990
 it costs 34 1500 euros and the one with the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.070
 lifting listening 37500 euros but otherwise 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.710
 they are exactly the same power 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.320
 just the one with the lift and costs 89 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.469
 euros of maintenance a day and the one without 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.579
 the lift listens 80,6 euros so here 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.380
 here is a little bit for the description 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.719
 frankly they are really not bad 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.429
 so we will go up in the one who 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.259
 is with the lift but otherwise the other 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.119
 is exactly the same 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.009
 so we'll get in and you go 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.240
 well listen to the sound that it makes when 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.240
 it starts frankly not bad 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 So here it is frankly a noise 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 rather nice so what right now 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 went to see a little inside what it 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.460
 looks so it looks exactly like 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.730
 one who had in xiii here 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.010
 the inside frankly well done very 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.400
 very well detailed here is the storyteller who 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 also works accelerated and the gauge to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.440
 essence also to work I believe them 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.120
 mans pedals does not work so you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.360
 have obviously high school so I put 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.430
 top the help you have high school then 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.950
 on the other hand, it's enter that you press 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.770
 you press enter so due does not like 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.280
 not and so you can open them 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.630
 doors 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.510
 so here are all the doors you can 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.130
 open them my mom is what we can 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.140
 really not open it so we can 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.000
 open this door if also here we are 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.959
 can really open everything by cons 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.280
 that a little bit boring and that's it 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.570
 have to pay on entry next to a 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.050
 dead end so it's a little bit more 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.480
 difficult 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.000
 we can open small windows 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.160
 side of course the window of 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.800
 behind seven sites on this side one can 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.240
 open it too is normally if I 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.780
 remember, we must be able to open 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.450
 rise too 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.950
 that's about what it is 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 like an outdoor seen when all 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.690
 is open 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.300
 so it's frankly a nice little 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.220
 tractor that can serve two very well 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.580
 farm valets or otherwise because 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.230
 it glue casually 145 horses so 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.560
 it's not bad then also if you 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.209
 hit the path theme set up you 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.040
 can put the double wheel good that 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.680
 the back but you m double wheel so 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.209
 frankly with a little black of three 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.360
 meters behind that can be a tractor 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.680
 very nice in 145 horses 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.239
 frankly it should rather not 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.760
 badly so we'll go quickly to see 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.740
 about how fast they 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.090
 ride at maximum for all 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.530
 take off the double wheel it's useless 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.270
 so also yes I did not tell you the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.140
 turn signals works one sees them even 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.150
 in interior view 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.570
 so here's the right flashing them 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.100
 warnings and the left turn signal 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.140
 lighting is the same everything works 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.050
 here you press f 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.350
 that's all works so that's 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.820
 frankly not bad so otherwise level 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.040
 top speed lepreau beacon 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.840
 also works that's perfectly without 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.270
 problem is at the peak speed level 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.700
 so it's 42 km hour so its 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.800
 about not bad for a tractor of this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.870
 kind so here's the starches frankly 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.239
 I hope this little fashion test you 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.170
 will have pleased of course it's a mode 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.940
 who is washable 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.340
 on the other hand if you do not have the mode the 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.810
 bourget if I looked well so he did 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.980
 not the mode the fair purse is that a 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.100
 little pity but otherwise frankly 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.570
 it's a very very beautiful fashion we see the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.880
 friends I tell you next time 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.800
 I hope this episode that this new 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.510
 fashion test will have pleased you if this is the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.610
 case do not hesitate to let go a little 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.450
 blue thumbs that will make me frankly very 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.160
 very pleasure 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.700
 and I tell you next time and 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.700
 that everyone
