right here and I'm going to lift this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.310 
right here and I'm going to lift this
metal<00:01:45.899> tab<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:47.299> after<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.540> move

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
metal tab up here first after that move

metal tab up here first after that move
it<00:01:50.180> move<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.960> slightly<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it move this just slightly so that it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.899 
it move this just slightly so that it
doesn't<00:01:53.579> land<00:01:53.939> back<00:01:54.180> onto<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:55.729> kind<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.790> like

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
doesn't land back onto the kind of like

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.350 
doesn't land back onto the kind of like
the<00:01:57.149> teeth<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.350> snugged<00:01:58.799> i<00:01:59.360> want

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the teeth so it will be snugged i want

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.359 
the teeth so it will be snugged i want
it<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.170> offset<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> then

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
it to be a little bit offset and then

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.880 
it to be a little bit offset and then
once<00:02:02.670> i<00:02:02.790> moved<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
once i moved it a little bit like that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.260 
once i moved it a little bit like that
then<00:02:04.890> i<00:02:05.009> could<00:02:05.189> open<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> second<00:02:06.090> ones

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
then i could open up the second ones

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300 
then i could open up the second ones
once<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.810> pulled<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.740> i<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:08.009> move<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
once that pulled up then i could move it
