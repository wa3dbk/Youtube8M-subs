 his work is called container series 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.950
 that are made up of three sculptures in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.660
 what this new artist gives him 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.020
 protagonism to the objects that make 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.179
 part of everyday life 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.609
 the work as such will be on the 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.369
 absences on how the objects are 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.350
 can become a passive witness of 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.570
 the absences then like those objects 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.119
 they become a representation of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.090
 someone who is no longer but gives by 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.520
 their coexistence remains because they have been in 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.280
 in situ with people acquires about 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.640
 characters and today a temporary step of 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.709
 abuse of memory footprint pedro léon 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.020
 red at 20 years the designer of 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.299
 fashions and has devoted part of his life to 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.399
 modeling today is one of the finalists 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.069
 thanks to the effort and work that 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.989
 He dedicated to his work attachment as condemnation 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.909
 it's about a dress made by 300 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.360
 padlocks and where he merges his two 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.090
 passions art and fashion design 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.340
 goal for this time is to see that weight 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.079
 that weight of all that burden because if 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.070
 well it's a dress in a way 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:08.399
 humaniza blé de 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.400
 develop then it must be confronted as 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.070
 viewer to see the weight to see it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 the material as it is conformed that is 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.680
 a way that looks nice but 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.870
 you also see that it is a part that is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.540
 marked all that marking all this 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.640
 pattern of all this confinement that is being 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.100
 living then it seems to me that with the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.040
 viewer is related to that and he 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.810
 realize that we all have this kind of 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.120
 manifestations in our daily life is 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.350
 what is sought is the objective one of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.690

 chief curator of the antioquia museum what 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.530
 what is important to recognize in this is 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.830
 that capacity just for some 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.530
 way to get involved with its context and 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.920
 speak from there the art from all 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.920
 ways 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.130
 a space to version the world that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.569
 is what artists do show us 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.099
 small facets 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.560
 or great facets but show us what 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.959
 regularly we do not see so that 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.359
 work from everyday to 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.969
 talk about matters that are simply 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.790
 very human is is a capacity 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.519
