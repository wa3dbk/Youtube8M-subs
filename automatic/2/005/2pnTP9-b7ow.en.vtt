00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.760
 at least 15 days during the month of 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.519
 January 2015 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.910
 we had an atmospheric blockade that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.670
 was even strong the center of the high 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 South Atlantic subtropical advanced to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.650
 The interior of Brazil 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.010
 we had some days where the center of the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.199
 subtropical highlands was positioned in the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 the interior of the Southeast reaches 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 also part of the west center 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.540
 so this gave us a very strong force 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.840
 great pressure on top of Brazil. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.870
 which caused a great reduction of rainfall 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.180
 in the southeast in the center west of the country 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 this lock was broken with a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.039
 cold front on January 21 ahead 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 that entered São Paulo and then 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.010
 then advanced through the southeast to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 situation of the second fortnight of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.379
 February is again the performance of the high 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.559
 subtropical donations consumption on top of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.920
 Brazil, but in a much less 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.130
 the center of the subtropical 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 South Atlantic shall not penetrate the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 interior of brazil 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.610
 he approaches the country again with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.119
 moderate to strong but not 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 will have sufficient strength to advance through 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.810
 country interior 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.090
 then in this situation with high 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 subtropical region of the nearby South Atlantic 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.119
 southeastern region but not within the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 Brazil I will also have a reduction of 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.579
 instability but not a reduction 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 as intense as we had in 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.380
 January the rain showers will be 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 less frequent in southeast central west 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.579
 But the will happen 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280
 south atlantic subtropical high 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.950
 begin to invade the southeastern region 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680
 this is already happening during the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.710
 carnival she does not enter the southeast but 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.630
 She'll be standing here then at the end. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.119
 I'm going to have a rain reduction in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.869
 southeast region mainly on the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.090
 holy spirit all north-central 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.459
 mines that also come out of the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 center north of rio de janeiro who - 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.290
 will feel the effect of this 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 The reduction is São Paulo, it's going to have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.450
 still frequent rain showers
