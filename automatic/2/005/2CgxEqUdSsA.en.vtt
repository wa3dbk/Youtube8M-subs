00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 why do we need to segment advertising 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.200
 channel I have prepared a good example 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.699
 which will help you understand why you need 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.760
 do it so go imagine there is 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 you are an entrepreneur and you are an owner 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.900
 apple plantation you have three 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.830
 employee who collect apples on 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 this plantation they work for you 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 everyday 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 these employees you pay 20 each 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 dollars for 20 dollars a day is worth them 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 work for this they collect you 200 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.230
 kilograms of apples you sell these apples 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.440
 earn money and your head 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 the picture is that each of these employees 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 collect approximately equal share of total 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.410
 mass that is approximately 67 kilograms 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 collects each in such a way it turns out 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.899
 every day you get 200 kilos 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 apples 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.439
 but actually this is not the picture 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.299
 the real is very different from that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.729
 what's in your head 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.270
 actually employee one of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.700
 employee 2 smoke all day and collect 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.240
 only 10 kilograms of apples per 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.939
 day and employee number three collects 180 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 kilograms of apples a day while 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.509
 remind you to pay everyone equally 20 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.689
 dollars a day what's in this situation 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.150
 need to do well naturally 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.549
 from the first two employees you need 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.280
 get rid of it purely mathematically 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.259
 will save you 40 dollars a day 40 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.290
 dollars a day you will and teams 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.009
 saved it means earned that is 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.820
 simple action you save 40 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.799
 dollars a day further instead of first 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.960
 two employees can take the other two 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.079
 that will work as well as 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.810
 third so you changed two 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.160
 employees who also began to collect 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.210
 180 kilos of apples here 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.500
 and it turns out already 540 pounds in 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.710
 day you get 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.930
 that is, your profit increases by three 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.680
 times your company's profit 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.320
 increases three times and I understand that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.690
 This example may seem to many 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.640
 ridiculous or absurd but the worst 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.520
 truth is that 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.910
 most businesses everything works exactly 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.740
 since i showed i know personally 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.920
 a huge number of examples when 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.980
 business use many channels 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.740
 attracting customers and he doesn't know in 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.460
 the accuracy of which channel of attraction 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.130
 a client has come and it's very scary because 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.470
 that in essence this is this picture when 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.950
 these moments begin to hide 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.190
 it turns out that from channel 1 for example 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.220
 80 percent of customers come from 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.520
 channel 2 only 20 while being spent on 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.100
 they have the same amount of money already 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.770
 the picture changes a lot and in 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.390
 most cases it turns out that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:21.190
 several channels that you use 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.010
 they are just minus one or more 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.500
 give the main profit therefore just 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.320
 getting rid of inefficient channels you 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.900
 save out scaled effective 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.730
 channel you increase your profits like this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.730
 it works I hope I brought it to you
