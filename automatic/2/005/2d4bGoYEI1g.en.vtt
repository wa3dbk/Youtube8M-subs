00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
look at the camera cludes new maps at

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.429 
look at the camera cludes new maps at
the<00:00:23.790> camera<00:00:24.150> over<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.710> camera<00:00:26.070> Yeah

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
the camera over here the camera Yeah

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:38.780 
the camera over here the camera Yeah
Yeah<00:00:28.439> right<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:29.070> no<00:00:29.669> was<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.750> hard<00:00:37.790> ok

Yeah right there no was that so hard ok
I<00:00:39.000> guess<00:00:39.690> we'll<00:00:39.870> start<00:00:40.140> by<00:00:40.350> looking<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.950> some

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I guess we'll start by looking at some

let's<00:04:18.410> take<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.590> look<00:04:18.799> at<00:04:18.889> how<00:04:18.980> that<00:04:19.040> works<00:04:19.540> I'll

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
let's take a look at how that works I'll

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.060 
let's take a look at how that works I'll
hop<00:04:20.750> into<00:04:20.989> target<00:04:21.200> practice<00:04:23.860> classes<00:04:24.860> and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
hop into target practice classes and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.220 
hop into target practice classes and
load<00:04:25.220> outs<00:04:25.430> are<00:04:25.700> quick<00:04:26.030> selected<00:04:26.540> by<00:04:26.750> using

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
load outs are quick selected by using

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.280 
load outs are quick selected by using
the<00:04:27.650> number<00:04:28.070> pad<00:04:28.450> so<00:04:29.450> first<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.900> get<00:04:30.050> the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
the number pad so first you get the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.500 
the number pad so first you get the
number<00:04:31.220> for<00:04:31.550> your<00:04:31.700> class<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.270> then<00:04:32.419> the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
number for your class and then the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.710 
number for your class and then the
number<00:04:32.860> for<00:04:33.860> your<00:04:33.950> loadout<00:04:34.310> in<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.510> way<00:04:35.690> I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
number for your loadout in this way I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.879 
number for your loadout in this way I
can<00:04:36.110> quickly<00:04:36.530> switch<00:04:36.889> between<00:04:37.630> classes<00:04:38.630> and

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
can quickly switch between classes and

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.050 
can quickly switch between classes and
between<00:04:39.889> save<00:04:40.250> loadouts<00:04:40.990> in<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.110> normal<00:04:42.470> game
