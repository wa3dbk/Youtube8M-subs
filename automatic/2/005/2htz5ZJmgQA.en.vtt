00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.089 

kind<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.050> hard<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.290> explain<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.890> I'm<00:03:19.980> just

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
kind of hard to explain so I'm just

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.500 
kind of hard to explain so I'm just
going<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> play<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.670> slow<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.270> hopefully

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
going to play it slow and then hopefully

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:38.090 
going to play it slow and then hopefully
you<00:03:21.750> get<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.900> pattern<00:03:36.020> okay<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:37.830> and

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
you get the pattern okay and then and

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.309 
you get the pattern okay and then and
then<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.610> play<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.940> out<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.360> play<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.050> once

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
then you play it out you play that once

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.809 
then you play it out you play that once
and<00:03:40.620> then<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.860> second<00:03:41.220> part<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.610> same

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
and then the second part is the same

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.190 
and then the second part is the same
thing<00:03:42.060> except<00:03:42.360> when<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.540> get<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.930> fifth

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
thing except when you get to the fifth

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.050 
thing except when you get to the fifth
