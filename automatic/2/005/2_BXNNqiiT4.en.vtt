week's game development log video diary
and<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.830> week<00:00:05.009> I've<00:00:05.250> been<00:00:05.310> finishing<00:00:05.970> off

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
and this week I've been finishing off

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.089 
and this week I've been finishing off
the<00:00:06.210> entity<00:00:06.629> editor<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.170> programming<00:00:07.950> a

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the entity editor and programming a

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.190 
the entity editor and programming a
parser<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.910> allow<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.300> game<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.780> read<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
parser to allow my game to read the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.310 
parser to allow my game to read the
entity<00:00:10.500> files<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> editor<00:00:11.849> creates<00:00:12.320> so

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
entity files that the editor creates so

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.780 
entity files that the editor creates so
let's<00:00:13.500> get<00:00:13.650> straight<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> updates<00:00:14.610> that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
let's get straight into the updates that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.760 
let's get straight into the updates that
I've<00:00:14.910> made<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> entity<00:00:15.690> editor<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.230> first

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I've made to the entity editor and first

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
I've made to the entity editor and first
off<00:00:16.980> I'm<00:00:17.220> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.460> show<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.910> finished

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
off I'm going to show you the finished

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.210 
off I'm going to show you the finished
particle<00:00:18.779> settings<00:00:19.140> I've<00:00:19.650> now<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.070> these

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
particle settings I've now got these

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.980 
particle settings I've now got these
error<00:00:20.490> margins<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> work<00:00:21.270> allowing<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
error margins to work allowing you to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779 
error margins to work allowing you to
make<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> particle<00:00:22.769> settings<00:00:23.070> slightly<00:00:23.609> more

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
make the particle settings slightly more

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.570 
make the particle settings slightly more
random<00:00:24.359> gravity<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:25.710> also<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.189> set<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
random gravity can now also be set to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
random gravity can now also be set to
negative<00:00:26.970> which<00:00:27.480> makes<00:00:27.750> everything<00:00:28.140> float<00:00:28.410> up

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
negative which makes everything float up

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189 
negative which makes everything float up
and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.699> direction<00:00:30.269> setting<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.019> more

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and the direction setting is now more

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
and the direction setting is now more
useful<00:00:31.650> because<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.250> added<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.759> diverge

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
useful because I've added this diverge

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.479 
useful because I've added this diverge
slider<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.440> lets<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.860> choose<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.340> error

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
slider which lets you choose the error

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
slider which lets you choose the error
margin<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> direction<00:00:36.570> giving<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> some

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
margin for the direction giving you some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.880 
margin for the direction giving you some
pretty<00:00:38.010> nice<00:00:38.219> cone<00:00:38.640> effects<00:00:39.410> as<00:00:40.410> well<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
pretty nice cone effects as well as that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.799 
pretty nice cone effects as well as that
you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.100> now<00:00:41.489> choose<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:41.969> particle<00:00:42.510> Atlas

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you can now choose which particle Atlas

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.160 
you can now choose which particle Atlas
you<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> texture<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> particles<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
you want to texture the particles and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
you want to texture the particles and
finally<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> added<00:00:46.739> some<00:00:46.950> settings<00:00:47.399> for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
finally I added some settings for

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
finally I added some settings for
particle<00:00:48.059> targets<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.110> suck<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
particle targets which suck the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.840 
particle targets which suck the
particles<00:00:50.280> towards<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.360> magnets<00:00:52.850> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
particles towards them like magnets so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.360 
particles towards them like magnets so
I'll<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.390> open<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> tree<00:00:55.559> entity<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I'll now open the tree entity and you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'll now open the tree entity and you
can<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.940> I've<00:00:57.090> added<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.480> few<00:00:57.510> more

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
can see here that I've added a few more

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
can see here that I've added a few more
component<00:00:58.770> choices<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.850> tree<00:01:00.090> already<00:01:00.329> has

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
component choices the tree already has

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.270 
component choices the tree already has
the<00:01:00.899> particle<00:01:01.350> component<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the particle component here which is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
the particle component here which is
creating<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> falling<00:01:03.359> leaves<00:01:03.570> effect<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
creating the falling leaves effect so

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100 
creating the falling leaves effect so
let's<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:04.949> add<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.430> collision<00:01:06.210> box<00:01:06.390> component

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
let's now add a collision box component

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
let's now add a collision box component
when<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> add<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> component<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.060> removes

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
when you add a component now it removes

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
when you add a component now it removes
it<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.900> list<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.439> components<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it from the list of components and you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
it from the list of components and you
can<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.030> remove<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.659> component<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> want

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
can also remove a component if you want

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
can also remove a component if you want
which<00:01:14.100> will<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.729> back<00:01:14.880> into<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
which will just put it back into the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
which will just put it back into the
list<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:16.950> choose<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.520> collision

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
list but let's now choose some collision

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.969 
list but let's now choose some collision
objects<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> tree<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> our<00:01:19.710> player

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
objects for the tree so that our player

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.940 
objects for the tree so that our player
can<00:01:20.280> collide<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> in-game<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.080> these

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
can collide with it in-game and these

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.039 
can collide with it in-game and these
are<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.250> obj<00:01:23.970> files<00:01:24.299> containing<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
are just obj files containing the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
are just obj files containing the
collision<00:01:25.439> meshes<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.070> made<00:01:26.310> surrounding

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
collision meshes that I made surrounding

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
collision meshes that I made surrounding
the<00:01:27.030> tree<00:01:27.210> model<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.689> blender<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.460> see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the tree model in blender you can see

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
the tree model in blender you can see
the<00:01:29.729> preview<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> collision<00:01:30.780> boxes<00:01:31.140> over

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the preview of the collision boxes over

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
the preview of the collision boxes over
here<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> left<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.090> only<00:01:33.329> shows<00:01:33.630> up

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
here on the left but this only shows up

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
here on the left but this only shows up
when<00:01:34.110> you're<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> collision<00:01:35.009> box<00:01:35.189> tab<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
when you're in the collision box tab so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.700 
when you're in the collision box tab so
it<00:01:36.360> doesn't<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.530> you're

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
it doesn't get in your way when you're

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
it doesn't get in your way when you're
adding<00:01:37.890> different<00:01:38.280> components<00:01:39.680> finally

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
adding different components finally

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
adding different components finally
there<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.460> sound<00:01:41.850> components<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
there are these two sound components the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.420 
there are these two sound components the
sound<00:01:43.079> emitter<00:01:43.380> gives<00:01:43.710> an<00:01:43.860> entity<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
sound emitter gives an entity the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.609 
sound emitter gives an entity the
ability<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.090> emit<00:01:45.390> sound<00:01:45.720> while<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.350> sound

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
ability to emit sound while this sound

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.630 
ability to emit sound while this sound
looper<00:01:47.040> uses<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> sound

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
looper uses the sound

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.539 
looper uses the sound
to<00:01:48.850> play<00:01:49.150> some<00:01:49.450> random<00:01:49.869> sounds<00:01:50.260> on<00:01:50.440> loop<00:01:50.830> this

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
to play some random sounds on loop this

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.910 
to play some random sounds on loop this
means<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.180> sound<00:01:52.390> looper<00:01:52.900> requires<00:01:53.409> the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
means that the sound looper requires the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.219 
means that the sound looper requires the
sound<00:01:54.190> emitter<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.119> if<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.330> try<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.630> add<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
sound emitter so if I try to add the

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.170 
sound emitter so if I try to add the
sound<00:01:56.470> looper<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.130> will<00:01:57.280> automatically<00:01:58.000> add

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
sound looper it will automatically add

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.960 
sound looper it will automatically add
the<00:01:58.420> sound<00:01:58.659> emitter<00:01:59.080> as<00:01:59.380> well<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
the sound emitter as well so in the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.520 
the sound emitter as well so in the
sound<00:02:01.210> looper<00:02:01.570> there<00:02:01.750> are<00:02:01.840> first<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.170> couple<00:02:02.440> of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
sound looper there are first a couple of

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.380 
sound looper there are first a couple of
options<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:03.100> decide<00:02:03.400> how<00:02:03.729> long<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:04.180> waits

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
options to decide how long it waits

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.080 
options to decide how long it waits
between<00:02:05.020> playing<00:02:05.350> each<00:02:05.649> sound<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.369> I'll<00:02:06.909> just

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
between playing each sound and I'll just

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.969 
between playing each sound and I'll just
set<00:02:07.240> these<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.570> 0<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:08.080> our<00:02:08.289> sound<00:02:08.500> simply

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
set these to 0 so that our sound simply

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
set these to 0 so that our sound simply
plays<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.489> loop<00:02:09.819> then<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.140> choose<00:02:11.350> any

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
plays on loop then you can choose any

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.440 
plays on loop then you can choose any
number<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.130> possible<00:02:12.520> sound<00:02:12.790> effects<00:02:13.180> for<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
number of possible sound effects for the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.390 
number of possible sound effects for the
sound<00:02:13.720> looper<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.140> choose<00:02:14.530> from<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.310> will

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
sound looper to choose from and it will

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
sound looper to choose from and it will
just<00:02:15.550> randomly<00:02:15.970> choose<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.330> sound<00:02:16.840> effect

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
just randomly choose one sound effect

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.280 
just randomly choose one sound effect
from<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> list<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:18.069> play<00:02:18.280> each<00:02:18.550> time<00:02:19.290> finally

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
from the list to play each time finally

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.500 
from the list to play each time finally
there's<00:02:20.560> also<00:02:20.890> an<00:02:21.190> option<00:02:21.670> here<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.060> choose

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
there's also an option here to choose

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.240 
there's also an option here to choose
the<00:02:22.690> range<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> sound<00:02:23.530> effect<00:02:23.769> which

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the range of the sound effect which

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.190 
the range of the sound effect which
determines<00:02:24.820> how<00:02:24.940> far<00:02:25.209> away<00:02:25.480> from<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.810> entity

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
determines how far away from the entity

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.280 
determines how far away from the entity
the<00:02:26.560> sound<00:02:26.830> can<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.100> heard<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:28.870> we've<00:02:29.050> got

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the sound can be heard so now we've got

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.220 
the sound can be heard so now we've got
a<00:02:29.320> tree<00:02:29.830> emitting<00:02:30.519> this<00:02:30.700> lovely<00:02:31.209> wind<00:02:31.810> chimes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
a tree emitting this lovely wind chimes

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.040 
a tree emitting this lovely wind chimes
sound<00:02:32.800> effect<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> once<00:02:34.690> you've<00:02:34.840> finished

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
sound effect so once you've finished

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.229 
sound effect so once you've finished
creating<00:02:35.410> an<00:02:35.739> entity<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:36.489> save<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:37.030> which

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
creating an entity you can save it which

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.059 
creating an entity you can save it which
will<00:02:37.420> export<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.080> folder<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.739> this

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
will export it to a folder like this

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.920 
will export it to a folder like this
which<00:02:39.459> contains<00:02:39.610> all<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.120> information<00:02:40.269> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
which contains all the information and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.410 
which contains all the information and
necessary<00:02:41.350> resources<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> entity<00:02:42.910> uses

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
necessary resources that the entity uses

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.080 
necessary resources that the entity uses
then<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.680> simply<00:02:45.040> move<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.430> folder<00:02:45.790> into

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
then I can simply move that folder into

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.240 
then I can simply move that folder into
my<00:02:46.209> games<00:02:46.450> resource<00:02:46.959> folder<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.100> can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
my games resource folder and then I can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880 
my games resource folder and then I can
use<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.970> game<00:02:49.269> all<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.650> is

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
use it in the game all I have to do is

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.100 
use it in the game all I have to do is
to<00:02:51.130> load<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.370> entity<00:02:51.910> file<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.870> place

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
to load the entity file and then place

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.890 
to load the entity file and then place
it<00:02:53.290> wherever<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.829> want<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.519> world<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.600> I've

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
it wherever I want in the world so I've

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
it wherever I want in the world so I've
put<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> couple<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.530> trees<00:02:56.799> at<00:02:56.980> these<00:02:57.160> positions

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
put a couple of trees at these positions

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.660 
put a couple of trees at these positions
in<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.269> 3d<00:02:58.750> world<00:02:59.079> and<00:02:59.320> now<00:03:00.070> if<00:03:00.280> we<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.640> a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
in the 3d world and now if we have a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.699 
in the 3d world and now if we have a
look<00:03:00.820> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> game<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.930> see<00:03:02.200> these<00:03:02.380> trees

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
look in the game we can see these trees

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.800 
look in the game we can see these trees
that<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.280> created<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.820> entity<00:03:04.150> editor

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
that I just created in the entity editor

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.390 
that I just created in the entity editor
keep<00:03:05.200> rendering<00:03:05.650> nicely

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
keep rendering nicely

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
keep rendering nicely
so<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.209> for<00:03:09.239> another<00:03:09.629> week<00:03:09.930> next<00:03:10.439> week

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
so that is it for another week next week
