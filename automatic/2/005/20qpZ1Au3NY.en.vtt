00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
but the hero will make it over you know

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.859 
but the hero will make it over you know
overpower<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.909> be<00:01:10.000> unbalanced<00:01:10.540> not

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
overpower to be unbalanced not

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.050 
overpower to be unbalanced not
necessarily<00:01:11.680> guys<00:01:11.830> if<00:01:12.340> there's<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.580> new<00:01:12.820> hero

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
necessarily guys if there's a new hero

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
necessarily guys if there's a new hero
it<00:01:13.270> doesn't<00:01:13.540> mean<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.750> game<00:01:13.869> will<00:01:14.020> be

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
it doesn't mean the game will be

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.649 
it doesn't mean the game will be
unbalanced<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.240> know<00:01:16.330> they<00:01:16.479> could

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
unbalanced because you know they could

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.240 
unbalanced because you know they could
make<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:16.990> weak<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.320> mean<00:01:17.470> with<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.619> goblin<00:01:18.010> Prince

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
make it weak I mean with a goblin Prince

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.160 
make it weak I mean with a goblin Prince
it<00:01:18.400> could<00:01:18.580> have<00:01:18.700> low<00:01:18.909> health<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.020> could

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
it could have low health and it could

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.990 
it could have low health and it could
just<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.380> very<00:01:20.619> strong<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.460> know<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:21.909> only

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
just be very strong and you know it only

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240 
just be very strong and you know it only
target<00:01:22.510> resources<00:01:22.900> most<00:01:23.170> likely<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:23.890> it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
target resources most likely so it

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.520 
target resources most likely so it
wouldn't<00:01:24.580> really<00:01:24.850> take<00:01:25.479> out<00:01:25.689> defenses<00:01:26.350> so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
wouldn't really take out defenses so

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.530 
wouldn't really take out defenses so
wouldn't<00:01:26.890> necessarily<00:01:27.340> overpower<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.299> game

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
wouldn't necessarily overpower the game

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.600 
wouldn't necessarily overpower the game
it<00:01:29.049> would<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.409> really<00:01:29.680> help<00:01:29.950> farmers<00:01:30.430> out<00:01:30.580> a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
it would just really help farmers out a

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.340 
it would just really help farmers out a
lot<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.540> think<00:01:31.600> they'll<00:01:31.810> be<00:01:31.869> really<00:01:32.200> good

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
lot and I think they'll be really good

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.899 
lot and I think they'll be really good
for<00:01:32.530> low<00:01:32.710> levels<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.250> hopefully<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.729> would<00:01:33.790> be

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
for low levels so hopefully it would be

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.929 
for low levels so hopefully it would be
available<00:01:34.119> at<00:01:34.479> townhall<00:01:34.720> 7<00:01:34.900> or<00:01:35.470> 8<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:36.460> don't

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
available at townhall 7 or 8 I don't

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.249 
available at townhall 7 or 8 I don't
know<00:01:37.000> what<00:01:37.360> tunnel<00:01:37.720> do<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:37.900> think<00:01:38.049> it'll<00:01:38.170> be

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
know what tunnel do you think it'll be

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.719 
know what tunnel do you think it'll be
available<00:01:38.650> at<00:01:38.740> guys<00:01:38.920> if<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.280> does<00:01:39.460> come<00:01:39.700> out

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
available at guys if it does come out

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.640 
available at guys if it does come out
now<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.659> something<00:01:40.900> obviously<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.500> not

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
now this is something obviously it's not

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.350 
now this is something obviously it's not
guaranteed<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.189> come<00:01:42.340> out<00:01:42.490> but<00:01:42.640> I've<00:01:42.759> thought

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
guaranteed to come out but I've thought

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
guaranteed to come out but I've thought
for<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.689> longest<00:01:44.020> time<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.290> third<00:01:44.680> hero<00:01:44.979> would

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
for the longest time a third hero would

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
for the longest time a third hero would
have<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.700> happen<00:01:46.030> eventually<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.680> think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
have to happen eventually and I think

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.289 
have to happen eventually and I think
with<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> fact<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> defense's<00:01:49.119> keep

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
with the fact that the defense's keep

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.480 
with the fact that the defense's keep
getting<00:01:49.540> stronger<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.079> stronger<00:01:50.320> there's<00:01:51.189> no

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
getting stronger and stronger there's no

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.219 
getting stronger and stronger there's no
better<00:01:51.700> time<00:01:51.970> than<00:01:52.030> now<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.420> actually<00:01:52.720> add<00:01:53.020> it

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
better time than now to actually add it

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.770 
better time than now to actually add it
I'm<00:01:53.500> hoping<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.070> level<00:01:54.280> 5<00:01:54.610> Dragon<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.299> a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
I'm hoping for a level 5 Dragon and a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.420 
I'm hoping for a level 5 Dragon and a
goblin<00:01:56.020> prince<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.710> would<00:01:57.100> make<00:01:57.250> me

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
goblin prince and that would make me

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.069 
goblin prince and that would make me
extremely<00:01:57.729> happy<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.450> these<00:01:58.600> two<00:01:58.810> things

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
extremely happy of these two things

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.100 
extremely happy of these two things
happen<00:01:59.670> obviously<00:02:00.670> several<00:02:01.600> things<00:02:01.840> could

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
happen obviously several things could

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.050 
happen obviously several things could
happen<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.500> mean<00:02:02.619> healers<00:02:03.460> could<00:02:03.790> go<00:02:03.939> up
