00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
point if you stun them they basically

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520

very<00:01:07.680> important<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> usually<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
very important so usually I think I I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
very important so usually I think I I
did<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.210> again<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> sniper<00:01:12.990> rifle<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
did this again with a sniper rifle and I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.289 
did this again with a sniper rifle and I
used<00:01:14.580> warlord<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.560> warlord<00:01:16.560> pro<00:01:16.799> and

package and obviously a lot obviously
but<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> did<00:01:52.619> predict<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.430> wasn't<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but I did predict that I wasn't going to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.810 
but I did predict that I wasn't going to
get<00:01:54.380> nine<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.560> ten<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:55.890> eleven<00:01:56.130> kill<00:01:56.310> streak<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
get nine or ten or eleven kill streak so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.620 
get nine or ten or eleven kill streak so
I<00:01:56.850> kept<00:01:57.509> my<00:01:57.600> killstreaks<00:01:57.810> rather<00:01:58.290> low<00:01:59.630> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
I kept my killstreaks rather low and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.300 
I kept my killstreaks rather low and
that's<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> things<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> want

you're not gonna die as much and there's
it's<00:03:00.130> basically<00:03:00.370> all<00:03:00.580> you<00:03:00.790> I'm<00:03:01.480> trying<00:03:01.690> to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's basically all you I'm trying to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
it's basically all you I'm trying to
explain<00:03:01.990> this<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.470> best<00:03:02.620> way<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.770> can<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.940> it's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
explain this the best way I can but it's

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.130 
explain this the best way I can but it's
pretty<00:03:04.240> obvious<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.450> versus<00:03:07.840> 7

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
pretty obvious if it's just you versus 7

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.110 
pretty obvious if it's just you versus 7
Botts<00:03:08.350> every<00:03:08.620> time<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.010> get<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.160> kill<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.850> can

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
Botts every time you get a kill that can

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.850 
Botts every time you get a kill that can
cover<00:03:10.270> any<00:03:10.570> death<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.080> get<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.680> get<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
cover any death you get so if you get a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.160 
cover any death you get so if you get a
kill<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.250> top<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.790> kill<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.510> first<00:03:13.959> kill

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
kill on top of that kill the first kill

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.560 
kill on top of that kill the first kill
then<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:15.790> keep<00:03:16.090> going<00:03:16.300> you're

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
then you just you just keep going you're

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.810 
then you just you just keep going you're
just<00:03:16.780> racking<00:03:17.470> kills<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.190> you<00:03:18.370> not<00:03:18.670> gonna

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
just racking kills and you not gonna

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.150 
just racking kills and you not gonna
lose<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.330> get<00:03:19.480> more<00:03:19.630> than<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:19.870> kill<00:03:20.160> every

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
lose if you get more than one kill every

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.610 
lose if you get more than one kill every
life<00:03:21.430> obviously<00:03:22.150> because<00:03:23.050> your<00:03:23.290> teammates

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
life obviously because your teammates

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.720 
life obviously because your teammates
can't<00:03:23.860> let<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.100> down<00:03:25.770> if<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:27.370> makes<00:03:27.610> any

can't let you down if that makes any

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.370 
can't let you down if that makes any
sense<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:28.239> hope<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.480> don't<00:03:28.570> sound<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> retard

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
sense I hope I don't sound like a retard

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.270 
sense I hope I don't sound like a retard

taking a lot of cover here i had to play
very<00:03:36.070> very<00:03:36.340> defensively<00:03:36.820> I'm<00:03:37.090> trying<00:03:37.360> not<00:03:37.390> to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
very very defensively I'm trying not to

very very defensively I'm trying not to
camp<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:37.959> much<00:03:38.200> but<00:03:38.860> it's<00:03:39.730> almost<00:03:40.120> impossible

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
camp as much but it's almost impossible

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.560

than<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.110> previously<00:05:13.469> have<00:05:13.830> done<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:14.280> they

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
than you previously have done and they

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.670 
than you previously have done and they
also<00:05:15.210> run<00:05:15.449> this<00:05:15.599> sort<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.110> loop<00:05:16.319> around<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
also run this sort of a loop around the

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.260 
also run this sort of a loop around the
map<00:05:16.919> so<00:05:17.219> it's<00:05:17.370> not<00:05:17.490> that<00:05:17.550> hard<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:17.940> take<00:05:18.150> them

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
map so it's not that hard to take them

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.330 
map so it's not that hard to take them
out<00:05:18.889> if<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.610> know<00:05:20.879> where<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.719> roots<00:05:21.900> are

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340
