00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
take 10 trillion experience to level up

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
take 10 trillion experience to level up
from<00:01:38.850> 200<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.750> 250<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> no

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
from 200 to 250 I was like there is no

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
from 200 to 250 I was like there is no
way<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.920> ever<00:01:44.369> gonna<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.810> I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
way I'm ever gonna do this and I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.710 
way I'm ever gonna do this and I'm
definitely<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:47.009> gonna<00:01:47.189> race<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.790> 250<00:01:48.509> because

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
definitely not gonna race to 250 because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.219 
definitely not gonna race to 250 because
it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:49.920> time

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
it's just going to take so much time

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.959 

so<00:01:54.200> fast-forward<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.530> few<00:01:55.560> months<00:01:56.100> unleash

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so fast-forward a few months unleash

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.410 
so fast-forward a few months unleash
comes<00:01:57.299> around<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.549> may

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
comes around and I was like well I may

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.950 
comes around and I was like well I may
as<00:02:00.479> well<00:02:00.600> race<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.289> 210<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.579> that's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
as well race to 210 because that's

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
as well race to 210 because that's
plausible<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.579> get<00:02:05.759> low<00:02:06.030> birthweight

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
plausible and I can get low birthweight

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.509 
plausible and I can get low birthweight
links<00:02:06.600> kill<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:06.929> my<00:02:07.020> luminous<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.060> got<00:02:09.869> to

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
links kill for my luminous so I got to

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.080 
links kill for my luminous so I got to
level<00:02:11.519> 210<00:02:12.180> within<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.080> first<00:02:13.459> two<00:02:14.459> weeks<00:02:14.489> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
level 210 within the first two weeks of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.000 
level 210 within the first two weeks of
Unleashed<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:17.750> then<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.349> stopped<00:02:19.650> there

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
Unleashed and then I just stopped there

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
Unleashed and then I just stopped there
cold<00:02:20.489> turkey

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
cold turkey

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.830 
cold turkey
I<00:02:21.769> think<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.890> was<00:02:23.010> around<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:23.610> that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
I think that was around the time that

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.559 
I think that was around the time that
xenon<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.220> demon<00:02:26.220> Avenger<00:02:26.580> came<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.299> I

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
xenon and demon Avenger came out so I

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.650 
xenon and demon Avenger came out so I
just<00:02:27.870> took<00:02:28.590> my<00:02:28.769> time<00:02:28.799> played<00:02:29.430> them<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.480> them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
just took my time played them but them

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.890 
just took my time played them but them
to<00:02:30.810> about<00:02:31.019> love<00:02:31.260> 130<00:02:32.220> ish<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.900> then<00:02:35.690> after<00:02:36.690> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
to about love 130 ish and then after I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
to about love 130 ish and then after I
finished<00:02:36.930> playing<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:38.190> demon<00:02:38.549> Avenger

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
finished playing with my demon Avenger

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
finished playing with my demon Avenger
the<00:02:39.840> rankings<00:02:40.200> came<00:02:40.380> up<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:42.680> remember

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the rankings came up and I remember

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.759 
the rankings came up and I remember
looking<00:02:44.489> at<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:47.190> top<00:02:47.459> three<00:02:47.910> were

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
looking at it and the top three were

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.270 
looking at it and the top three were
pure<00:02:50.569> illumination<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.069> immiscible<00:02:53.069> and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
pure illumination and immiscible and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.300 
pure illumination and immiscible and
they<00:02:53.730> were<00:02:53.790> all<00:02:54.060> from<00:02:54.420> chi<00:02:54.750> knee<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.530> was<00:02:55.739> in

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
they were all from chi knee and I was in

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.039 
they were all from chi knee and I was in
fourth<00:02:57.299> place<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.440> luminous<00:02:59.060> rankings<00:03:00.060> so

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
fourth place in the luminous rankings so

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.780 
fourth place in the luminous rankings so
I<00:03:01.470> thought<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> myself<00:03:02.220> well<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:04.310> thought<00:03:05.310> let<00:03:05.549> K

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I thought to myself well I thought let K

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.330 
I thought to myself well I thought let K
me<00:03:05.819> have<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.750> luminous<00:03:07.139> glory<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
me have all of the luminous glory so I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.190 
me have all of the luminous glory so I
figured<00:03:09.150> since<00:03:10.819> rank<00:03:11.819> two<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.450> three<00:03:12.750> we're

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
figured since rank two and three we're

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.780 
figured since rank two and three we're
only<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.470> couple<00:03:13.680> levels<00:03:14.130> higher<00:03:14.310> than<00:03:14.489> me<00:03:14.609> I'd

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
only a couple levels higher than me I'd

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.340 
only a couple levels higher than me I'd
start<00:03:15.269> training<00:03:15.690> again<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.900> few<00:03:19.170> months

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
start training again so a few months

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.090 
start training again so a few months
went<00:03:19.859> by<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:21.720> was<00:03:22.079> just<00:03:22.290> training<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.859> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
went by and I was just training on and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.479 
went by and I was just training on and
off

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
off

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.509 
off
it<00:03:24.180> took<00:03:24.420> me<00:03:24.630> something<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.590> four<00:03:26.010> or<00:03:26.250> five

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it took me something like four or five

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.960 
it took me something like four or five
months<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.329> get<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> level<00:03:28.019> 220<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.100> by<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
months to get to level 220 and by that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.670 
months to get to level 220 and by that
time<00:03:30.680> red<00:03:31.680> was<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.220> released<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.989> during<00:03:34.440> red

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
time red was just released so during red

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.259 
time red was just released so during red
I<00:03:34.950> noticed<00:03:35.910> something<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:38.269> three

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
I noticed something so I have three

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.920 
I noticed something so I have three
laptops<00:03:40.130> one<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.549> my<00:03:41.940> main<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.630> for<00:03:42.660> my

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
laptops one for my main one for my

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.089 
laptops one for my main one for my
Bishop<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.440> one<00:03:43.680> for<00:03:43.889> my<00:03:44.040> kana<00:03:44.849> meals<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
Bishop and one for my kana meals and

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.199 
Bishop and one for my kana meals and
something<00:03:47.099> I<00:03:47.220> noticed<00:03:47.510> at<00:03:48.510> red<00:03:49.319> was<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.519> they

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
something I noticed at red was that they

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.159 
something I noticed at red was that they
had<00:03:51.660> changed<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.620> way<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.630> Connors<00:03:54.630> kitchen

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
had changed the way that Connors kitchen

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.670 
had changed the way that Connors kitchen
worked<00:03:56.180> how<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.329> used<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.599> work<00:03:57.690> was<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.440> used

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
worked how it used to work was it used

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.170 
worked how it used to work was it used
to<00:03:58.859> increase

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
to increase

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.759 
to increase
then<00:04:00.540> amount<00:04:01.170> of<00:04:01.439> monsters<00:04:02.069> on<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.599> map<00:04:03.769> but

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
then amount of monsters on the map but

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.610 
then amount of monsters on the map but
after<00:04:05.129> red<00:04:05.370> they<00:04:05.700> actually<00:04:06.269> fixed<00:04:06.719> it<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.049> it

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
after red they actually fixed it and it

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.319 
after red they actually fixed it and it
actually<00:04:07.980> does<00:04:08.159> what<00:04:08.579> it's<00:04:08.730> supposed<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.150> do

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
actually does what it's supposed to do

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.280 
actually does what it's supposed to do
which<00:04:09.629> is<00:04:10.319> reduce<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.519> respawn<00:04:12.000> time<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.599> I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
which is reduce the respawn time and I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.409 
which is reduce the respawn time and I
noticed<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.859> while<00:04:14.489> training<00:04:14.790> at<00:04:15.180> golems<00:04:16.169> I

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
noticed this while training at golems I

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.760 
noticed this while training at golems I
noticed<00:04:18.419> that<00:04:18.660> as<00:04:18.870> soon<00:04:19.410> as<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:20.400> killed<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.770> wave

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
noticed that as soon as I killed a wave

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.150 
noticed that as soon as I killed a wave
of<00:04:23.130> golems<00:04:23.580> they'd<00:04:23.940> instantly<00:04:24.720> respawn<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.530> I

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
of golems they'd instantly respawn and I

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.840 
of golems they'd instantly respawn and I
thought<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.520> myself<00:04:26.639> well<00:04:27.500> since<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.680> can<00:04:28.919> to

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
thought to myself well since I can to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.499 
thought to myself well since I can to
hit<00:04:30.270> golems<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.610> one<00:04:32.910> hit<00:04:33.150> Hall<00:04:33.389> of

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
hit golems and I can one hit Hall of

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.050 
hit golems and I can one hit Hall of
Honor<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:34.190> guess<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.310> would<00:04:35.430> be<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> lot<00:04:35.820> faster

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
Honor I guess it would be a lot faster

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.969 
Honor I guess it would be a lot faster
if<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:37.160> trained<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.280> Hall<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.550> Honor<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.410> moved

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
if I trained a Hall of Honor so I moved

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.740 
if I trained a Hall of Honor so I moved
there<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:42.470> that's<00:04:43.470> how<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> shot<00:04:44.190> up<00:04:44.340> to

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
there and then that's how I shot up to

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.730 
there and then that's how I shot up to
rank<00:04:46.039> 3<00:04:47.039> by<00:04:47.759> Christmas<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:49.349> was<00:04:49.470> at<00:04:49.590> that

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
rank 3 by Christmas and I was at that

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.350 
rank 3 by Christmas and I was at that
point<00:04:50.070> where<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.580> was<00:04:51.199> telling<00:04:52.199> myself<00:04:53.090> well<00:04:54.090> I

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
point where I was telling myself well I

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.650 
point where I was telling myself well I
have<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:55.110> pretty<00:04:55.620> good<00:04:55.770> shot<00:04:56.130> at<00:04:56.310> rank<00:04:56.669> 1<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.300> I

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
have a pretty good shot at rank 1 so I

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.020 
have a pretty good shot at rank 1 so I
may<00:04:58.229> as<00:04:58.259> well<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.949> for<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.310> right<00:05:01.610> by<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.759> time

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
may as well go for it right by that time

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.640 
may as well go for it right by that time
I<00:05:03.300> was<00:05:03.599> around<00:05:04.229> level<00:05:06.710> 227<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.889> believe<00:05:08.220> and

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
I was around level 227 I believe and

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.010 
I was around level 227 I believe and
that<00:05:10.650> Christmas<00:05:11.130> event<00:05:11.490> was<00:05:12.020> absolutely

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
that Christmas event was absolutely

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.570 
that Christmas event was absolutely
crazy<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.440> was<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> one<00:05:14.039> where<00:05:14.250> there<00:05:14.460> was

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
crazy that was the one where there was

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.020 
crazy that was the one where there was
the<00:05:14.760> 24-hour<00:05:16.070> 2x<00:05:17.070> event<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.580> they<00:05:17.729> threw<00:05:17.940> in

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
the 24-hour 2x event and they threw in

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.510 
the 24-hour 2x event and they threw in
some<00:05:18.210> 3x<00:05:18.659> in<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.199> middle<00:05:19.440> of<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.889> I

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
some 3x in the middle of that and I

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.210 
some 3x in the middle of that and I
stayed<00:05:21.330> up<00:05:21.479> for<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.690> entire<00:05:22.199> event<00:05:22.470> thinking
