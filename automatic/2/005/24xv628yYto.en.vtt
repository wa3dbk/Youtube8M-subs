00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
nice I don't have to use an adapter for

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.810 
nice I don't have to use an adapter for
it<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:14.840> those<00:02:15.050> are<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.860> tools<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.640> are

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
you can see them side by side as

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.259 
you can see them side by side as
compared<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.310> actual<00:03:16.610> device<00:03:16.820> itself<00:03:16.850> and

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
compared to the actual device itself and

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
compared to the actual device itself and
you<00:03:17.390> gonna<00:03:17.480> see<00:03:17.660> how<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.810> look<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.350> actually

installing the bamboo backing onto the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.060 
installing the bamboo backing onto the
phone<00:03:33.170> should<00:03:33.470> be<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.650> matter<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:33.980> just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
phone should be a matter of just

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.699 
phone should be a matter of just
snapping<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.880> which<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.209> great<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.440> I'm<00:03:36.560> not

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
snapping it on which is great so I'm not

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.050 
snapping it on which is great so I'm not
too<00:03:36.890> worried<00:03:37.130> about<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.459> removing<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
too worried about that removing the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.449 
too worried about that removing the
sandstone<00:03:38.690> cover<00:03:39.019> however<00:03:39.440> uh<00:03:39.709> was<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> little

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
sandstone cover however uh was a little

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.800 
sandstone cover however uh was a little
bit<00:03:40.549> difficult<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.030> with<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.239> included<00:03:41.630> tool

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
bit difficult but with the included tool

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.289 
bit difficult but with the included tool
it<00:03:42.350> finally<00:03:42.980> kind<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.549> came<00:03:43.790> out<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.239> was

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
it finally kind of came out and it was

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.699 
it finally kind of came out and it was
definitely<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.870> lot<00:03:44.989> better<00:03:45.110> than<00:03:45.350> using<00:03:45.440> like

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
definitely a lot better than using like

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.020 
definitely a lot better than using like
a<00:03:45.739> flathead<00:03:46.220> screwdriver<00:03:46.250> or<00:03:46.880> your

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
a flathead screwdriver or your

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.420 
a flathead screwdriver or your
fingernails<00:03:47.480> god<00:03:47.690> forbid<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.890> nonetheless<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
fingernails god forbid but nonetheless I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.620 
fingernails god forbid but nonetheless I
wanted<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.730> take<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.880> quick<00:03:50.090> look<00:03:50.269> at<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
wanted to take a quick look at the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.530 
wanted to take a quick look at the
insides<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.440> these<00:03:52.220> two<00:03:52.430> covers<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.330> you<00:03:53.420> can

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
insides of these two covers so you can

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.880 
insides of these two covers so you can
just<00:03:53.750> sort<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> see<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.410> differences<00:03:54.830> between

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
just sort of see the differences between

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.160 
just sort of see the differences between
them<00:03:55.340> one<00:03:56.120> thing<00:03:56.239> I<00:03:56.299> will<00:03:56.450> point<00:03:56.600> out<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:56.840> that

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
them one thing I will point out is that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.370 
them one thing I will point out is that
the<00:03:57.380> sandstone<00:03:57.920> material<00:03:58.489> does<00:03:58.790> feel<00:03:59.780> like

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the sandstone material does feel like

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.440 
the sandstone material does feel like
it's<00:04:00.620> on<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.860> sides<00:04:01.130> here<00:04:01.310> but<00:04:01.700> on<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.150> bamboo

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
it's on the sides here but on the bamboo

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.840 
it's on the sides here but on the bamboo
cover<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.110> have<00:04:03.230> bamboo<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.920> back<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.820> on

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
cover you have bamboo on the back but on

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.970 
cover you have bamboo on the back but on
the<00:04:05.120> sides<00:04:05.390> here<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> plastic<00:04:06.739> lining

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
the sides here it is a plastic lining

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.470 
the sides here it is a plastic lining
and<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.280> course<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.610> insides<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.090> both<00:04:08.239> are

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
and of course the insides of both are

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.479 
and of course the insides of both are
made<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.870> plastic<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:09.590> that's<00:04:10.040> not<00:04:10.130> much<00:04:10.280> of<00:04:10.430> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
made of plastic so that's not much of a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.740 
made of plastic so that's not much of a
surprise<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.940> really<00:04:11.120> not<00:04:11.239> that<00:04:11.360> big<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.570> deal

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
surprise and really not that big a deal

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.690 
surprise and really not that big a deal
I<00:04:11.930> just<00:04:12.170> thought<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.320> would<00:04:12.530> mention<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.980> so

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
I just thought I would mention that so

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.180 
I just thought I would mention that so
we're<00:04:13.910> gonna<00:04:14.030> put<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.510> sandstone<00:04:15.170> aside<00:04:15.830> and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
we're gonna put the sandstone aside and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.849 
we're gonna put the sandstone aside and
it<00:04:16.850> will<00:04:17.060> probably<00:04:17.870> sit<00:04:18.169> in<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.410> drawer<00:04:18.620> now

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it will probably sit in a drawer now

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.900 
it will probably sit in a drawer now
because<00:04:19.280> now<00:04:19.520> it's<00:04:19.700> time<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.910> install<00:04:20.239> the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
because now it's time to install the

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:32.040 
because now it's time to install the

have a full bamboo backing but I
understand<00:05:33.099> that<00:05:33.219> that's<00:05:33.340> not<00:05:33.460> necessarily

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
understand that that's not necessarily

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.879 
understand that that's not necessarily
the<00:05:34.120> case<00:05:34.300> but<00:05:34.870> when<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.169> go<00:05:35.319> from<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.680> bamboo

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
the case but when you go from the bamboo

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.950 
the case but when you go from the bamboo
to<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.340> plastic<00:05:36.849> and<00:05:37.060> then<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.389> move<00:05:37.599> over

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
to the plastic and then you move over

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.040 
to the plastic and then you move over
more<00:05:38.169> you<00:05:38.440> also<00:05:38.650> still<00:05:39.009> have<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.520> metal<00:05:40.050> sort

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
more you also still have that metal sort

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.589 
more you also still have that metal sort
of<00:05:41.169> frame<00:05:41.530> around<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.310> screen<00:05:42.729> so<00:05:43.120> there's<00:05:43.539> a

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
of frame around the screen so there's a

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.360 
of frame around the screen so there's a
bit<00:05:43.719> of<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.870> juxtaposition<00:05:44.110> when<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.009> comes<00:05:45.190> to

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
bit of a juxtaposition when it comes to

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.709 
bit of a juxtaposition when it comes to
the<00:05:45.490> look<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.849> this<00:05:45.969> phone<00:05:46.180> once<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.569> have

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
the look of this phone once you have

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.779 
the look of this phone once you have
this<00:05:46.870> bamboo<00:05:47.080> cover<00:05:47.469> on<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.190> not<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.370> big<00:05:48.430> deal

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
this bamboo cover on it's not a big deal

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.339 
this bamboo cover on it's not a big deal
by<00:05:49.029> any<00:05:49.240> means<00:05:49.509> but<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:49.960> something<00:05:50.199> that

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
by any means but it is something that

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.719 
by any means but it is something that
you<00:05:50.440> might<00:05:50.560> notice<00:05:50.979> that<00:05:51.159> you<00:05:51.250> basically<00:05:51.400> have

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
you might notice that you basically have

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.510 
you might notice that you basically have
well<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.330> three<00:05:52.840> toned<00:05:53.229> phone<00:05:53.860> at<00:05:54.099> this<00:05:54.219> point

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
well a three toned phone at this point

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.240 
well a three toned phone at this point
but<00:05:55.509> nonetheless<00:05:55.719> it<00:05:56.169> still<00:05:56.380> looks<00:05:56.620> very<00:05:57.069> nice

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
but nonetheless it still looks very nice

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.550 
but nonetheless it still looks very nice

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.240 
connectivity on this particular phone I

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.010 
do see that I still get reception just
fine<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.819> the<00:06:07.270> one<00:06:07.419> thing<00:06:07.569> that<00:06:07.630> I<00:06:07.750> knew<00:06:07.990> I

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
fine and the one thing that I knew I

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.629 
fine and the one thing that I knew I
really<00:06:08.409> wanted<00:06:08.590> to<00:06:08.710> test<00:06:08.919> out<00:06:09.069> was<00:06:09.340> whether<00:06:09.550> or

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
not the end of see changes on here as

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.189 
not the end of see changes on here as
well<00:06:11.529> well<00:06:12.099> I<00:06:12.130> tested<00:06:12.699> it<00:06:12.789> on<00:06:12.969> my<00:06:13.210> UE<00:06:13.509> mega<00:06:13.930> boom

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
well well I tested it on my UE mega boom

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.230 
well well I tested it on my UE mega boom
and<00:06:14.469> sure<00:06:14.680> enough<00:06:14.710> it<00:06:15.219> was<00:06:15.460> able<00:06:15.789> to<00:06:15.909> connect

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
and sure enough it was able to connect

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.600 
and sure enough it was able to connect
to<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.509> speaker<00:06:16.870> just<00:06:16.900> flying<00:06:17.590> using<00:06:17.979> NFC<00:06:18.310> and

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
to the speaker just flying using NFC and

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.920 
to the speaker just flying using NFC and
then<00:06:18.699> of<00:06:18.789> course<00:06:18.819> Bluetooth<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.569> get<00:06:19.750> right

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
then of course Bluetooth to get right

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.529 
then of course Bluetooth to get right
over<00:06:20.319> so<00:06:20.500> it<00:06:21.039> looks<00:06:21.219> like<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.639> connectivity

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
over so it looks like the connectivity

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.209 
over so it looks like the connectivity
options<00:06:22.750> are<00:06:23.199> still<00:06:23.440> going<00:06:23.710> to<00:06:23.800> remain<00:06:23.949> the

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:24.219 
options are still going to remain the

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.469 
options are still going to remain the
same<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.729> you'll<00:06:24.819> still<00:06:25.000> have<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.300> same
