00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.260 
to the smoker step one is to get the
smoker<00:04:01.010> go<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.580> up<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.820> temperature

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
smoker go and get it up the temperature

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.390 
smoker go and get it up the temperature
and<00:04:02.390> get<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.630> level<00:04:02.870> then<00:04:03.650> we'll<00:04:03.860> start<00:04:04.070> having

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
and get it level then we'll start having

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.699 
and get it level then we'll start having
the<00:04:04.490> smoke<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.060> then<00:04:05.270> we<00:04:05.360> put<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.600> me<00:04:05.810> up<00:04:05.930> so

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
the smoke and then we put the me up so

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.110 
the smoke and then we put the me up so
the<00:04:06.860> smoker<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.280> up<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.550> about<00:04:07.700> two<00:04:07.970> hundred

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
the smoker is up to about two hundred

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.180 
the smoker is up to about two hundred
and<00:04:08.360> forty<00:04:08.720> six<00:04:08.959> degrees<00:04:09.320> will<00:04:09.590> get<00:04:09.740> close<00:04:10.010> to

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and forty six degrees will get close to

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.880 
and forty six degrees will get close to
250<00:04:10.820> once<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.720> gets<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.959> 250<00:04:12.530> that's<00:04:12.709> where

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
250 once it gets to 250 that's where

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.290 
250 once it gets to 250 that's where
we're<00:04:12.980> going<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.190> work<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.520> vents<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:13.970> try<00:04:14.180> and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
we're going to work the vents to try and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.180 
we're going to work the vents to try and
level<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.630> off<00:04:14.750> right<00:04:14.959> there<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.470> go<00:04:15.680> would

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
level it off right there and go would

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.009
