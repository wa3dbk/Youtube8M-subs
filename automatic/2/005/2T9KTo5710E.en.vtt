everything offends someone in some way
shape<00:01:35.770> or<00:01:35.950> form<00:01:36.160> so<00:01:36.600> offending<00:01:37.600> people<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:38.110> not

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
shape or form so offending people is not

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.020 
shape or form so offending people is not
not<00:01:39.490> in<00:01:39.729> offending<00:01:40.600> people<00:01:40.899> is<00:01:41.020> impossible<00:01:41.590> so

someone's going to be offended no matter

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.850 
someone's going to be offended no matter
what<00:01:47.590> now<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.369> question<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.500> being

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
what now the question is is being

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.230 
what now the question is is being
offended<00:01:51.250> legit<00:01:51.940> or<00:01:52.330> not<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:53.910> lot<00:01:54.910> people<00:01:55.060> so

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240

you<00:01:55.390> shouldn't<00:01:55.630> be<00:01:55.720> offended<00:01:56.020> or<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.619> should

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
you shouldn't be offended or you should

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.850 
you shouldn't be offended or you should
be<00:01:57.039> offended<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.810> think<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.229> rests<00:01:59.619> on<00:01:59.800> the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
be offended but I think it rests on the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.670 
be offended but I think it rests on the
material<00:02:00.369> conditions

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.300
