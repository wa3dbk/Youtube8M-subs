00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 I am fascinated by eye makeup when 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.429
 neat and smooth 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.420
 shades goes from one to another and 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.929
 dissolve like haze 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 framing emphasizing look like 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.380
 perfect shade shadows than secrets and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.960
 subtleties talk about their observations 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.779
 by the way if you are interested in finding out how 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.980
 make light day makeup then 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 follow the link to the channel to sony 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 returning to the topic I want to draw 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 attention that good feathering depends 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 from the quality of the shadows their texture is matte and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.930
 sateen most supple and easy 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.500
 lie on the eyelid so we choose them 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 for perfect shading in make-up 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.870
 prepare the century using primer 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.270
 to keep your makeup fresh all day 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 and did not require adjustment during 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 days now we put on all eyelids light 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 neutral matte shade so 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 We create a smooth texture to 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 the brush and the shadows slid easily and lay down 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.250
 not clogging and not creating dirty 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.290
 Levkov frosted shadows easily fall off 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 be prepared for this 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 apply ton face upon completion 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.720
 eye makeup 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.580
 or carefully remove brush 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.490
 surplus immediately 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.700
 matte brown tint mark 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.280
 draw the border of the century 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.259
 corner this will be the most intense 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.570
 shade part in our makeup 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.049
 light brush strokes in the direction 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.930
 up 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 we begin to shade the border creating 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 required form 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.970
 to better shade the border take 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 shade a few shades lighter 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.500
 this will help create a smooth transition 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 shades 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.590
 light circular movements of the brush 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.940
 move it from the corner of the eye to the middle 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.310
 the darkest shade should 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.720
 get in the corner of the eye and already to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.130
 the middle of the light becomes lighter 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.220
 to adjust the shape 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.530
 use a pencil brush to more accurately 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.060
 and more detailed draw us 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.060
 corner 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.599
 and again fluffy brush light 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.730
 Shade with a matte shade. 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.280
 white tint will help lighten 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.340
 area under the brow and shade the excess 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 brown tones and create light 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.060
 gradient to give intensity and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.819
 contrast 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.480
 light gray on mobile eyelid 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.200
 matte tone and we do not go abroad with 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.200
 brown tint 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.379
 satin cool brown 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.040
 use to emphasize 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.500
 eye shape do a stroke along the line 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.349
 eyelash growth to the end of the border 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 brown shade and shade it 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.659
 movements up we get a shade a little 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.659
 corner and in the crease of the century 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.989
 warm peach sand satin 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.510
 tons will refresh the corner of the inner century and 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.020
 will create a spring mood 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.910
 light clapping movements 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.290
 we put and we mix it with the main 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.400
 tinged so that there is no noticeable border 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.489
 will continue the spring theme 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.040
 the blue shadows we use for 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.810
 mucous corner brush gently 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.810
 apply shade 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.590

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.220
 Makeup black gel eyeliner will help 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.100
 create the effect of thick eyelashes in the corners 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.090
 eye along the line of eyelash growth 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.090
 thin line 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.440
 the corners will give drama to the eye 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.630
 false eyelashes apply glue 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.060
 transparent effect and apply 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.840

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:38.280
 lashes first mid and then lateral 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.150

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 can apply mascara at will my mascara 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.120

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.580
 opened a new but no so far with me 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.310
