00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they track very nicely we've improved

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
they track very nicely we've improved
the<00:00:42.300> hull<00:00:42.540> design<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.260> improve<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> tracking

the hull design to improve the tracking

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
the hull design to improve the tracking
so<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.600> having<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> side-to-side

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so you're not having that side-to-side

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
line very stable also still got that 85

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.720 
line very stable also still got that 85
centimetre<00:00:54.329> width<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.430> stand

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

in<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.600> hatches<00:01:57.930> you're<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.290> confined<00:01:58.880> max

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
in your hatches you're not confined max

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.230 
in your hatches you're not confined max
capacity<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.570> 250<00:02:01.469> kilograms<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:03.000> you've<00:02:03.119> got

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
capacity of 250 kilograms so you've got

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
capacity of 250 kilograms so you've got
plenty<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.600> weight<00:02:03.840> holding<00:02:04.259> capacity<00:02:04.380> there

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
plenty of weight holding capacity there

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.480 
plenty of weight holding capacity there
to<00:02:05.100> take<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> couple<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.909> people<00:02:06.270> plus<00:02:06.540> gear

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
to take out a couple of people plus gear

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.310 
to take out a couple of people plus gear
so<00:02:08.490> now<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.700> heard<00:02:08.940> me<00:02:09.119> talking<00:02:09.360> about<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
so now you heard me talking about the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.350 
so now you heard me talking about the
hull<00:02:11.009> design<00:02:11.340> being<00:02:11.610> changed<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.210> improve

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
hull design being changed to improve

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.120 
hull design being changed to improve
tracking<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.320> want<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> show<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.100> I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
tracking I just want to show you what I

tracking I just want to show you what I
was<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.520> talking<00:02:14.880> about<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.540> you'll

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
was actually talking about that you'll

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.690 
was actually talking about that you'll
notice<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> lot<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> generic<00:02:17.460> clacks

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
notice on a lot of the generic clacks

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.850 
notice on a lot of the generic clacks
and<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.180> our<00:02:18.330> first<00:02:18.720> generation<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.410> family

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and on our first generation of family

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.730 
and on our first generation of family
that<00:02:20.370> you've<00:02:20.490> got<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.910> wide<00:02:21.210> nose<00:02:21.710> that<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
that you've got a very wide nose that a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.360 
that you've got a very wide nose that a
sort<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.990> doesn't<00:02:24.990> quite<00:02:25.170> know<00:02:25.380> which<00:02:25.770> way<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
sort of doesn't quite know which way it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.890 
sort of doesn't quite know which way it
wants<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> go<00:02:26.880> when<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.210> push<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.570> through<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
wants to go when you push in through the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.990 
wants to go when you push in through the
water<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.160> we've<00:02:29.310> done<00:02:29.460> with<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.760> one

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
water so what we've done with this one

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.810 
water so what we've done with this one
is<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> sharpen<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> tip<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.830> that's

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
is to sharpen the tip up and that's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.580 
is to sharpen the tip up and that's
going<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.060> make<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.240> knife<00:02:33.540> edge<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.140> split<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
going to make a knife edge to split the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.650 
going to make a knife edge to split the
water<00:02:34.740> dead<00:02:35.220> even<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.090> you're<00:02:36.240> getting<00:02:36.450> even

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
water dead even so you're getting even

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.540 
water dead even so you're getting even
water<00:02:36.990> flow<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.530> both<00:02:37.770> sides<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> clock

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
water flow down both sides of the clock

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.100 
water flow down both sides of the clock
that<00:02:38.790> keeps<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> kayak<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.750> straight<00:02:40.080> line

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that keeps the kayak in a straight line

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.830 
that keeps the kayak in a straight line
while<00:02:40.530> you're<00:02:40.680> paddling
