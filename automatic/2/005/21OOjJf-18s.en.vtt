00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello to my sang this part 113 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.289
 meinkravt mechanism welcome to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 This series I will show you a wonderful 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.990
 the mechanism here it is me here and hidden and i 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.120
 I think this mechanism will be useful for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 those who survive on 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.360
 not on cards but let's say who has 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.240
 just the world where he lives survives with him 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.039
 there is a house in general ordinary 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 ordinary world yes if he has enough 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.239
 resources for this mechanism then i think we 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 wo will build and it will be very useful 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.120
 to have such a mechanism mechanism that makes 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 it opens a hidden passage but not easy 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.440
 somewhere and a hidden passage to such a place 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 where we have a stove there is a workbench there is 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.890
 anvil there is an enchantment table also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.379
 melts two chests 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 Ender chest and just a chest although you can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.789
 double here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.799
 You can even put in the house 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.850
 because in the house there will obviously be one stove 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.500
 one chest is not enough 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.010
 it can be put somewhere where 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 let's say something in a cave where 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.230
 the bottom of the cave where very very much 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 always running monsters in this turn off 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.910
 just let's let the farm farm here and you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.640
 will need such a thing today you 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 teach her to build are built on very easily 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 and in itself it is very compact and here 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.250
 absolutely nothing is needed here even 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.950
 delays are not different with the same in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.520
 Generally ok let's start build I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.440
 This scheme here put 4 blocks like this 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.060
 here then sticky piston sticky piston 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.080
 sticky piston sticky piston sticky 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.600
 piston sticky piston 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 sticky sticky now put here like this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.850
 here are the blocks and all 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.650
 and put sticky pistons still near the blocks 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.010
 that is, at the level of these blocks like this 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.560
 Here it turns out such a scheme 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.880
 here is the trick for the Mutka 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.819
 I do not remember no I remember everything I remember everything 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.610
 and here we put here such here 6 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.700
 block here such a detachment of blocks and spend 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.190
 redstone on it then put the lever 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 now we 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.240
 take here and so half block like this 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.070
 put three floated half a block 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.260
 patted block medium clean set 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 normal block like this 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.750
 the position here is the same 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.010
 get out put this way here a block 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.230
 then there is a repeater here redstone 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.200
 here too redstone here too repeater 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.390
 without delay there are two blocks and 2 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.840
 repeater delay 2 then repeat the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.160
 same thing two blocks 2 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.970
 repeater delay 2 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.820
 then we do here we put the block 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.660
 we got rain here from deliver here 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:07.460
 block here on it roadstone here here 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.700
 we put blocks here and so it seems in 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.640
 this position is not even in such here 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.420
 here we put a repeater to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.490
 repeater delay 4 here delay 1 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.060
 delay 1 connect all three tables to us 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.250
 here the block is the same of course 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.930
 same on the other side of this third stone 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:34.489
 block block block now here right here 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.160
 By the way, too, do not forget to put the blocks 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.920
 here is a repeater one delayed with 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360
 repeater 4 delay 3-4 delay 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.400
 repeater one connect it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.390
 again redstone im here again 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:51.310
 block set and in fact everything is ready 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:58.250
 almost we will rearrange the torch torch here block 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:03.170
 block redstone block redstone yes here 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.910
 we raise up the water which he 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.620
 we direct this block we put 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:17.239
 the ejector here repeat the pattern also 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:20.840
 Redstone itself block here is the ejector 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.669
 then put on top yet we put the hopper 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.640
 once operas 2 here we charge one any 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.800
 not trying object in my case i 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.670
 take perhaps 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 the cheapest thing is wood 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.600
 hoe not so here so all in hopper in 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.100
 one hopper wooden hoe throws 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.990
 in the second also a wooden hoe 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.620
 we throw and all 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.540
 dash put a block here and a block here and 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.390
 we put on the comparator 1 and 2 all the scheme 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.070
 now ready push as you see y 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.190
 everything works and everything returns 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.800
 back now just push this scheme 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.710
 so that the pistons are extended and that's it 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.790
 This we enter all this and will be your level 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.930
 The floor mechanism is compact and very 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.200
 reliable 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.940
 well working the very idea of â€‹â€‹construction 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.110
 I also liked building by the way, I did not 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.900
 that's all further what's next for you 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:30.590
 it's like you just need to close it all 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.970
 deal closing here these are all possible 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.700
 in general, to make just such 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.680
 a room if you want and you can here 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.360
 you can force the north with stakes and stoves 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.330
 stoves you can catch my my workbench 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.450
 Generally, as you wish, you are doing it 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.740
 such here it turns out the room here and on 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.110
 that's all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.230
 subscribe put your thumbs up not 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.650
 forget and comment with you was singing 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.650
 until
