00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 good 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:10.100
 hello everyone i'm viteri and today I 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.100
 we have all about 17 part 1 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.580
 Well, you can obviously talk about 7 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.009
 first what comfort is the new 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.390
 design and is that I do not design how can 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.720
 see has thinner backgrounds 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.280
 this cleaner less full of things and 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.760
 elements so let's go let's go 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.320
 to phone with him and see seven new 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.250
 animations right there could they what 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.650
 they could see with everything come on screen 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.090
 everything is a little softer than before everything 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.840
 It is more fluid than before with the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.489
 workshop 6 well flowed well pretty let's say 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.750
 and programs and start talking about 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.309
 certain things beyond design 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.230
 obviously we can see that the room 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.570
 app icons are risky company 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 designed has new things of which 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.800
 let's talk now and well the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 first it is spotlight that spotlight is not 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.710
 something new but they are positioned in a 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 new place when you have a 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.550
 for still time they always go here and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.509
 find the page to search but 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.460
 it turns out that it does not take 7's does not exist and 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.860
 exists on any screen from below 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.990
 from the center did not come down and appears 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.700
 then we go to another screen pull and 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.500
 appears is everywhere there is 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.860
 they have 10 pages you do not have to do one 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.930
 two three four five and up is not so 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.690
 pure end of your pages launched here 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.210
 and there is not good spotlight what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.729
 next would be the folders the folders 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.260
 we already know them very well at 16 here 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.400
 changed a bit for example let's 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.960
 open this and let's see that there is a 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.729
 animation tops the boom enlarges this and 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.160
 now they are like pages within the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.510
 videos folders and that means that 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.770
 let's see much more space than 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.390
 I had before for which I do not have 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.270
 no folder and is iphone specified 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.680
 have many applications like to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.810
 show the golden facts and the games 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.610
 and the games have several but this one 12 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.350
 so here we can see how they are not going to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.240
 more studying for 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.400
 by the different pages of it 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.840
 folder so that 's something new and every 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 more applications between each holder 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.300
 hence fewer folders on their screens 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.480
 major in their initials than what 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.750
 since they have their ios 7 upload their 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.420
 device to 17 this in addition to this there 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.720
 one that is very useful and since I use 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.420
 ios 7 is what I use very often that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.230
 is control center control center that is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.290
 he pulls from him from below to 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.939
 above and they appear is a new menu 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.290
 that for many familiar with 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.849
 Android will find it very familiar 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.140
 have here to put you airplane mode or 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.840
 be to turn off all the signals of 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.099
 coming and going of the phone to 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.409
 turn on or turn off the wifi and to 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.689
 turn on or turn off bluetooth to 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.290
 activate or deactivate the do not disturb mode 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.870
 and to 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.810
 to lock or not to the rotation of the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.390
 phone besides that has a meter 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.360
 here for the brightness 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.890
 very useful that this could give me messy 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
 the brightness for the video but in there 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.010
 more or less then play next 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.930
 previous to for music volume of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.940
 phone also here here the appears 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.140
 play and there is another button for the devices 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.690
 newer ones that I made 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.730
 airdrop that's a way to 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.140
 communicate with other appliances of aigÃ¼es 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.820
 then if you can send photos 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.140
 or whatever is good yes sure they are 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.720
 whatever is what can be sent by the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.070
 drop this I do not have it very clear but in 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.780
 synthesis is to send files 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.040
 between one phone and another without having to 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.170
 connect more than a network 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.090
 wireless apart from that here we have 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.060
 the internal one that we can see there how 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.900
 they see the interns 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.880
 this is the calculator and 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.230
 the camera thing we're going to talk about 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.780
 already the camera this has changed a 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.000
 little now they are cleaner interface is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.310
 lighter everything has more buttons from 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.160
 the button on the big one is more visual in 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.800
 good sense has to change from 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.150
 way does not have this new way that is 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.200
 is doing his app from left to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.440
 right for example here this new 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.900
 panorama as photography one by one that 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.669
 it's square regular photography that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.580
 those that are results and video is 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.620
 that the left 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.300
 apart from that it has new filters 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.919
 then like the three buttons we finish 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.210
 of three filters that are all live 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.330
 they continue making time as they can 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.330
 watch 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.990
 I do not know if you understand the idea 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.460
 in the filters 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.320
 just like before you can touch the button 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.020
 and take pictures or photography 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.890
 and this list is how it is faster to take 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.430
 a photography 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:57.050
 and that's it's already very fast 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.730
 then leaving us from the camera we see 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.680
 an animation when there is no 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.520
 application another animation of those that 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.330
 must be taken into account 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.580
 now let's talk about it notification 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.410
 center that this noble before good and 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.919
 we know it, we already know how it is and what 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.539
 make 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.000
 well from top to bottom like 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.280
 control center made invested from 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.159
 down up then here it takes 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.889
 all our screen and there are three caps 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:24.659
 is the first one is all they are are all 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.340
 notifications all those that are 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.069
 current right now all the songs that 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.139
 not to an agitated then if you do to 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.789
 right here once all the no 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.229
 views those that are not behaving 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.050
 face up and move from thing in 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.580
 things well if you are not used to being able 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.280
 shuaibi is much simpler is more 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.630
 natural and the other side totally to the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.150
 left is today then for example 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.669
 that Saturday September 4 storms 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.720
 scattered 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.650
 the weather gives me what I have to do 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.550
 that for example I wanted to record the videos 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.610
 reminders is one thing that takes more 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.260
 late the numbers of the bag of 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.970
 things that I follow 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.820
 and the things that I have to do tomorrow 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.880
 in the calendar says it I think with 12 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.020
 hours of range as it is moving 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.290
 here are the things that appear 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.450
 It has to be done within 12 hours 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.070
 and that's notification center for now 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.140
 it does not seem that they are going to add another 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.840
 once the buttons to publish directly 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.950
 to facebook and twitter personally that 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.680
 it hurts a little because I used it 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.540
 a lot but but really the notify 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.270
 I know apart from that, it improved a lot 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.610
 very much and so good that basically 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.980
 it's all for now obviously we're going to 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.420
 have this more parts of this video 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.980
 let's see the applications one by one 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.260
 in some video and let's see is the 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.120
 version of 7 on the ipad 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.470
 so wait I'm an intro and I'll 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.150
 I remember that they go to facebook twitter 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.650
 groups in instagram and are not found 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.270
 with move it will triple the beat 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.610
 He picked up comparing all the posts that 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.530
 we have done apart from that if they have not 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.090
 done with here below comment like and 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.790
 subscribe 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.340
 and he simply chooses if they want to see 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.550
 more about ios 7 I wait for you in the next 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.550
 video
