label off you can see how easily that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.639 
label off you can see how easily that
comes<00:01:31.500> off

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.899

the bottle is quite slippery actually

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.060 
the bottle is quite slippery actually
and<00:01:46.909> then<00:01:47.390> there's<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.799> going<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.009> do

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
and then there's a I'm just going to do

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
and then there's a I'm just going to do
a<00:01:49.100> quick<00:01:49.369> job<00:01:49.399> on<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.850> back<00:01:50.439> bag<00:01:51.439> label<00:01:51.920> and

a quick job on the back bag label and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.559 
a quick job on the back bag label and
then<00:01:53.840> if<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.109> have<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.700> residue<00:01:56.119> left<00:01:56.359> on

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
then if you have the residue left on

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.169 
then if you have the residue left on
there<00:01:56.780> which<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.649> probably<00:01:57.829> will<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:59.000> can

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
there which you probably will you can

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.340 
there which you probably will you can
scratch<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.479> off<00:01:59.719> with<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:00.259> scratch<00:02:01.069> cap<00:02:01.369> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
scratch that off with it scratch cap and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.359 
scratch that off with it scratch cap and
that<00:02:03.350> comes<00:02:03.619> off<00:02:04.030> quite<00:02:05.030> easily<00:02:05.350> if<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:07.039> have

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
that comes off quite easily if you have

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.550 
that comes off quite easily if you have
any<00:02:07.640> residual<00:02:08.619> stickiness<00:02:09.619> left<00:02:09.920> over<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
any residual stickiness left over you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.039 
any residual stickiness left over you
can<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.890> use<00:02:13.430> an<00:02:14.319> adhesive<00:02:15.319> remover<00:02:15.890> like

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.930 
can also use an adhesive remover like
googan<00:02:18.079> something<00:02:19.040> like<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.340> which<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> can

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
googan something like that which you can

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.089 
googan something like that which you can
get<00:02:20.120> at<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.390> store<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.079> you<00:02:21.890> know<00:02:22.069> a

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
get at the store to just you know a

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.979 
get at the store to just you know a
couple<00:02:22.190> dollars<00:02:22.610> basically<00:02:23.299> any<00:02:23.450> store<00:02:23.780> will

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
couple dollars basically any store will

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.199 
couple dollars basically any store will
sell<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.739> works<00:02:25.040> quite<00:02:25.340> well<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
sell that but this works quite well to

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.670 
sell that but this works quite well to
just<00:02:26.390> take<00:02:26.599> this<00:02:26.750> off<00:02:26.959> with<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> scratch<00:02:27.440> pad

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
just take this off with a scratch pad

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.610 
just take this off with a scratch pad
and<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:30.459> completely<00:02:31.459> free<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.940> any

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
and that is completely free of any

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.860 
and that is completely free of any
sticky<00:02:33.620> residue<00:02:33.650> or<00:02:34.280> any<00:02:34.610> label<00:02:35.090> left<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.720> it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
sticky residue or any label left on it

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.500 
sticky residue or any label left on it
and<00:02:36.110> that's<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.129> easy<00:02:37.310> I'll<00:02:37.519> just<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:38.390> like

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and that's so easy I'll just going like

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.319 
and that's so easy I'll just going like
this<00:02:38.840> off<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.400> comes<00:02:40.400> right<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.180> you're

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
this off to comes right off and you're

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.930 
this off to comes right off and you're
left<00:02:41.510> with<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:42.310> completely<00:02:43.310> clean

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
