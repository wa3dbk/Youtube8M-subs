before<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.640> had<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> surgery<00:01:11.060> which<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
before I had the surgery which as you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.100 
before I had the surgery which as you
can<00:01:12.720> tell<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.350> devastating<00:01:15.110> I've

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
can tell it's pretty devastating I've

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.399 
can tell it's pretty devastating I've
made<00:01:16.500> appointments<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> hospital<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.409> no

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
made appointments at the hospital and no

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.340 
made appointments at the hospital and no
go<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.150> appointments<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> few<00:01:21.930> weeks<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
go in for appointments in a few weeks I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
go in for appointments in a few weeks I
just<00:01:25.350> wanted<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.920> touch<00:01:26.130> base<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.119> guys

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.270 
just wanted to touch base with you guys
and<00:01:29.720> sometimes<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.140> guess<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.829> doesn't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and sometimes I guess it just doesn't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.520 
and sometimes I guess it just doesn't
work<00:01:32.430> out<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.220> seems<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.850> cruel

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
work out and but it just seems so cruel
