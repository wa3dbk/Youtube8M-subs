00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.509
 when I was 17 or 18 years would 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.480
 I could say that cinema for me was 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.360
 as as another life as another home a 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.450
 shelter now that is part of me 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.730
 life and it's a profession for me I have it 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.009
 less clear to know exactly in what 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.499
 consists of the cinema because you dedicate your 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.499
 life to the cinema and what radios is this not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.210
 I was doing what we tried, I think 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 that almost everyone by means of starting to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.370
 Write reviews you can get 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.660
 some way in what was called the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.880
 world of cinema 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 nobody saw what unfinished business' 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.650
 had any kind of possibilities and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 we went through I think the great way up 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.320
 down 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 the movie was casablanca was the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 love story of two people who in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 the past had had a relationship 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
 as in casablanca they were in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.489
 a very key situation in casablanca 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 obviously it was the war that was the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 end the agony of Franco's death 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 of franc and on the arrival of a new 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 regime and from a new country was the method 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.399
 little of the return and of course then the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.770
 movie did not look like casablanca but 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.770
 the essence was the same 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.420
 making movies with alfredo landa is 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.250
 how to make an American movie is the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 security with which the Americans roll 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.450
 when they roll with jack lemmon when 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.450
 roll with walter matthau 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.119
 Milkman also burned eggs will not 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 is the black film that I would have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.640
 liked to do but but I tried to do 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.060
 an experiment and curiously the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 experiment worked was fine and it's from 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.720
 the movies that I've made until 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.679
 moment that has had the most chance 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.679
 as time has passed 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.810
 and I've never understood how the Americans 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.909
 roll with a storyboard because of course the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.970
 roll with a storyboard is that it's already 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.490
 shot the movie I usually walk around 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.240
 the design 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.300
 mount the foreground and always the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.300
 planes are throwing one after another 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 tell me 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.270
 used soil 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.260
 is that there is a call for you from the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.470
 real home 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.799
 the movie was a sentimental movie 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.689
 Well, I found that it was 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.370
 premiered it was not nobody and then for those 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.890
 hazards of life when then what of the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 selection for what the oscar chose her 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 and he went deep into the lane and I 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.750
 So I found the same surprise with 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.319
 that everyone was found with a 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.319
 flight plane 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.319
 instinct what I think that moves the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.209
 great movies something that you can not 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.160
 measure that you can not calibrate and that's it 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.200
 what is that spark that is the instinct 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.470
 that makes you suddenly modify 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.470
 something 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.600
 the best football in Brazil in the world 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.710
 of mexico, the chaos was better 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.750
 glasgow upside down 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.530
 final of the fifth European Cup 73 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.450
 I just wanted to do the relationship of two 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.280
 people who have lived in a state of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.110
 movie thing that had happened to me 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.030
 not that they have dedicated their lives to film and 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 cinema passes over us and we 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.110
 crushes is one thing when I separated from 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.270
 my wife we reached an agreement she 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.970
 it was with all those of woody allen- t 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.830
 I think it's another wrong movie 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 that I did not know how to make a movie about 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.340
 cinema 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.030
 there would already be in the caverns of the town a 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.459
 it came as good as this they keep 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.410
 you for the mass here I knew what 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.970
 I wanted to do was aware that I did not 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.130
 I wanted to do the things I had done 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.430
 before I wanted to do other things 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.260
 I found an enormous security 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.780
 and that I could already decide gil parrondo 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.659
 manolo rojas or any action or not me 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.159
 I do not want this, I'm sure 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.629
 I have to do it like that if I 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.549
 wrong I'm wrong with all the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.920
 consequences but I think that 's the way I do not know 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.420
 is the movie where I found myself 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.760
 first time in my life I was a director 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.409
 cinema 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.230
 I would like to make a 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.060
 movie that will be a quarter of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.019
 well of the roads liked that child 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.019
 is what I would like to do
