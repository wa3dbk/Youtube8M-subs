00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the edges they're in pink and white if

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
the edges they're in pink and white if
you<00:02:03.149> look<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> pink<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.869> compared<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you look at the pink one on compared to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.300 
you look at the pink one on compared to
the<00:02:05.640> purple<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> maybe<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the purple one can you maybe see that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.600 
the purple one can you maybe see that
the<00:02:08.429> pink<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.849> has<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.360> wrenches<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the pink one has the wrenches and it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.990 
the pink one has the wrenches and it
does<00:02:11.880> these<00:02:12.630> are<00:02:12.690> UV<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.700> look<00:02:14.700> low<00:02:14.849> in

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
does these are UV so they look low in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.300 
does these are UV so they look low in
the<00:02:15.120> dark<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.810> these<00:02:15.959> are<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> pink<00:02:16.410> let's<00:02:19.310> and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the dark so these are the pink let's and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.610 
the dark so these are the pink let's and
then<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.569> white<00:02:22.050> ones<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.620> well

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
then I have white ones as well

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
then I have white ones as well
they're<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:25.769> cool<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.160> go<00:02:26.340> clubbing

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.890 
they're pretty cool if you go clubbing
really<00:02:28.590> show<00:02:28.739> them<00:02:28.980> off<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> light<00:02:32.900> um

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
really show them off in the light um

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
really show them off in the light um
then<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.799> another<00:02:34.890> parrot<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.580> are<00:02:35.760> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
then I have another parrot that are a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.960 
then I have another parrot that are a
silicone<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.600> they<00:02:36.750> are<00:02:36.989> purple<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.580> they

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
have stars in them I don't wear these

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.990 
have stars in them I don't wear these
that<00:02:43.440> often<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.010> think<00:02:44.220> they're<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.700> bit

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that often I think they're a little bit
