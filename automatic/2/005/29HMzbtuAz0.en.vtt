00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.709 
larders determine the number of oak
Larter's<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:51.210> calculate

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Larter's you need to make to calculate

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.920 
Larter's you need to make to calculate
the<00:00:51.899> amount<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.289> plank<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.920> plants<00:00:53.430> required

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
the amount of plank of plants required

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.720 
the amount of plank of plants required
take<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.199> amount<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.539> required<00:00:57.539> o<00:00:57.899> clutters

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
take the amount of required o clutters

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.219 
take the amount of required o clutters
so<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.850> our<00:00:59.969> case<00:01:00.210> 26<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> multiply<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.010> by<00:01:02.219> 8

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
so in our case 26 and multiply it by 8

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
so in our case 26 and multiply it by 8
we<00:01:04.229> need<00:01:05.090> 208<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.510> planks<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.530> make<00:01:07.640> 26<00:01:08.640> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
we need 208 of planks to make 26 of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.980 
we need 208 of planks to make 26 of
Larter's

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
Larter's

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.350 
Larter's
so<00:01:11.620> it<00:01:11.860> just<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.190> happens<00:01:12.549> at<00:01:12.670> about<00:01:12.790> that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
so it just so happens at about that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.469 
so it just so happens at about that
amount<00:01:13.690> from<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.200> GE<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.820> calculate<00:01:16.299> the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
amount from the GE to calculate the

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
amount from the GE to calculate the
amount<00:01:16.540> amount<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:17.229> money<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.710> require

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
amount amount of money you require

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.160 
amount amount of money you require
divide<00:01:19.680> 208<00:01:20.680> by<00:01:23.190> 24<00:01:24.190> as<00:01:24.670> 24<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.690> amount<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
divide 208 by 24 as 24 is the amount of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.160 
divide 208 by 24 as 24 is the amount of
both<00:01:27.159> plans<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:27.850> will<00:01:27.940> effectively<00:01:28.420> fit<00:01:28.869> in

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
both plans that will effectively fit in

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.030 
both plans that will effectively fit in
our<00:01:29.290> inventory<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.810> divide<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.470> by<00:01:32.710> 8

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
our inventory we then divide that by 8

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.139 
our inventory we then divide that by 8
as<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.090> demon<00:01:34.360> Butler<00:01:34.890> charges<00:01:35.890> per<00:01:36.850> eight

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
as the demon Butler charges per eight

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.910 
as the demon Butler charges per eight
uses<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.950> multiply<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.580> by<00:01:39.759> 10<00:01:40.420> K<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.740> get

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
uses then multiply that by 10 K to get

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.090 
uses then multiply that by 10 K to get
the<00:01:42.130> amount<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.759> GP<00:01:43.539> required<00:01:43.960> I<00:01:44.350> usually<00:01:44.890> take

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
the amount of GP required I usually take

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.270 
the amount of GP required I usually take
10<00:01:45.490> K<00:01:45.759> extra<00:01:46.360> than<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.810> amount<00:01:47.140> required<00:01:47.470> just

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
10 K extra than the amount required just

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.200 
10 K extra than the amount required just
in<00:01:48.429> case<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.850> mess<00:01:49.060> up<00:01:49.240> somewhere<00:01:50.789> we<00:01:51.789> then<00:01:52.000> take

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
in case I mess up somewhere we then take

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.570 
in case I mess up somewhere we then take
out<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> miscellaneous<00:01:53.350> item<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.130> act<00:01:54.340> as

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
out a miscellaneous item just to act as

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.150 
out a miscellaneous item just to act as
a<00:01:54.610> placeholder<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.780> yeah<00:01:56.470> just<00:01:56.770> as<00:01:56.920> so

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
a placeholder so yeah just as so

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.850 
a placeholder so yeah just as so
anything<00:01:57.580> can<00:01:57.729> go<00:01:57.880> there<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:59.080> now<00:01:59.440> we<00:01:59.500> need<00:01:59.770> to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
anything can go there so now we need to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.650 
anything can go there so now we need to
head<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.039> our<00:02:00.280> house<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.850> easiest<00:02:01.119> way<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.420> to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
head to our house the easiest way is to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:16.270 
head to our house the easiest way is to
use<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.990> home<00:02:02.170> teleport

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:26.010 

first<00:02:17.280> things<00:02:17.519> first<00:02:18.060> switch<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:19.400> building

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.140 

then<00:02:26.620> we're<00:02:26.860> gonna<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.370> track<00:02:27.580> down<00:02:27.610> our

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
then we're gonna have to track down our

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.570 
then we're gonna have to track down our
Butler<00:02:28.480> D<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.320> we're<00:02:29.590> definitely<00:02:30.160> he's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
Butler D but we're definitely he's

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.270 
Butler D but we're definitely he's
pretty<00:02:30.880> cool<00:02:31.030> spot<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.270 

I'm<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.970> ask<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> affects<00:02:36.720> both<00:02:36.990> planks<00:02:38.660> 24

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
I'm gonna ask it affects both planks 24

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
over and over again and if we do it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.120 
over and over again and if we do it
perfectly<00:03:38.560> we<00:03:39.460> should<00:03:39.790> be<00:03:40.000> able<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.510> get

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
hour and this was taking into account

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.850 
hour and this was taking into account
human<00:03:48.820> error<00:03:49.030> maybe<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.380> guys<00:03:50.530> will<00:03:50.680> be<00:03:50.740> able

and<00:03:53.200> as<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.590> was<00:03:53.710> paying<00:03:53.890> 100%<00:03:54.250> attention<00:03:54.850> so

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
and as that was paying 100% attention so

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.270 
and as that was paying 100% attention so
I<00:03:55.780> simply<00:03:56.770> keep<00:03:57.130> repeating<00:03:57.490> this<00:03:57.760> process

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
I simply keep repeating this process

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.520 
I simply keep repeating this process
