 Nowadays, it's okay, I'm the cris 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.040
 asked you those channels with links 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 from youtube this week I'm doing 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.450
 this video because there are a lot of people 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 who sent several things that are not 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.949
 Please post only channels of the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.010
 youtube anything else is going to be 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 ignored below 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 documentary someone posts me a page 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 from facebook unction I declare of some 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 space youtube video that is not a 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 channel is a random video that has no 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 nothing to see 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.980
 so the person wants to add me with a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.290
 friend who sent me a message saying 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.899
 Look, I do not have the channel if you have 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 which gives the excuse that you do not have 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.829
 because you did not have time to do it because 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 never did it because if the director never 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.489
 spent your video book yet or because 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 Are you still recording? 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.110
 You're not ready to send the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.420
 curriculum or material for this work 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.910
 at the moment it 's much more worthy of you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 expect to have the material and then 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 present to the person who is 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.399
 asking when you already have the material 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.809
 Why talk ah, I do not have anything else. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.689
 When you have finished, it only denotes 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.400
 amateurism despair complains 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 casting producers who complain about 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.399

 simply burn your movie or else 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.030
 What is much more common is that you are 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.160
 ignored and never know why it is 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.350

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.870

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.360

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.459
 Time is because you stopped doing what? 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.440
 that profile anything else is 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.170
 so please if you want to have a 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.350
 good relationship with a casting researcher 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.480

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.090
 People have to want to get the job of 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.670
 want to be chosen there is a myth is 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.180
 We listen to this myth very much. 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.260
 told them if they like you 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.660
 they'll find a way for you to call 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.060
 it's not true it's not necessarily 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.160
 Truth they can love you. 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.140
 however if you are not sure for that 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.480
 Work they will not call me 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.330
 they may even love their work more 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.549
 if your posture was inconvenient and the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.320
 your posture is not very professional 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.019
 You 're not going to be called either because 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.880
 Are you going to have problems? 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.060
 We will have problems working 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.560
 I was not researching with you. 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.760
 talents band people who know how to play 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.769
 guitar 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.700
 none of these were looking for 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.400
 youtube 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.010

 facebook of the band will not go 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.799
 It's no good if we have this illusion. 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.280

 They will love me and they will want to do it. 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.040
 a youtube channel for me not the people 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.409
 because the intention is not to promote 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.019
 band people please pay attention 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.269
 read if you have a job to read because 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.389
 There are a lot of people doing a lot. 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.639
 wrong and burning without realizing it 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.210
 post wrong material and make posts 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.280
 in convenient and that is why I 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.280
 I decided to make this video and that's why 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.139
 I decided to make more videos for 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.509
 explain to the people 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.460
 so many things happen that the 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.789
 I see it right there in agencies or even 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.150
 on tests that I do because a lot of people 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.430
 a lot of people stomping on the ball so I 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.810
 I thought our someone needs to talk to 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.030
 these people how the market works 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.139
 You do not even need to talk to these people 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.990
 it's the real 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.570
 so if you want tips on how to 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.620
