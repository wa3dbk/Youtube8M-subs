00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello everyone today will tell you about 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.690
 revision in the cylinder head I had a video like 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 this is just the head of the video module was 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.769
 there is experience something there are not likes few 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 They put me here at the same 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.910
 head but it's not home yes it's different all 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.210
 filed all yes here sondo as here 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 were 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 it is now and today I will tell well that is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 a roller cone their usual which look 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.480
 video 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:38.300
 they are not right everywhere 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.219
 but in the end I came up with as I'm 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 invented such a device from 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.070
 valve this is an exhaust valve first in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.700
 He was originally a diameter of 16 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.920
 millimeters i.e. inlet diameter 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.780
 valve by the way it is lightweight look 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 the past or 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.289
 inlet valve diameter 18 half then 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.180
 have them can squander 2 to 16 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:08.369
 empty window to have room for both 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.200
 so that the chamfer was not very normal 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.630
 thin there basically 2 millimeters 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.400
 enough here even yes remember so here I am 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 did it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:25.979
 first cut the same teeth and I 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.970
 squandered the intake of the goldfinches then I took 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.909
 reduced it to 14 meters and graduation 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.150
 valve with mit 16 that is two millimeters 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.560
 A lot of stock, that is, it is so exhausted here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.390
 also grow and now 414 is just that already 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.820
 later when I redid 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.950
 Well, here's the proof of what's on 16 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 millimeters by faced graduation 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 valve comes try yourself he doesn't 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.280
 calling 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 and here on the standard here does not go 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.790
 superman them also does not go here then 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.530
 There is obtained this maximum under 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:14.610
 consume on valve language well here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.860
 turns on here we have we 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.660
 remains 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.920
 fill millimeter to chamfer miracle there is 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.770
 125 on the side and on release 1 comment 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.630
 that is, even paski we get very 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.700
 thin 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.690
 not very well and quite normal to us 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.270
 will give you something less likely 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.860
 jumped valve burnout something that area 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.130
 small with shells only 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.320
 the better, that is, I even so their resource 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.690
 will increase 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.600
 head until all sign subscribe 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.150
 likes join a group in contact there 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.060
 There will be all sorts of news when some video about 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.060
 the fact that in the future will be all for now
