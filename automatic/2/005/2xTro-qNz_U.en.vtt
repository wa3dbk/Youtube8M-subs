00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hey my life means I show you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.220
 nail design I tried so 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.560
 to turn flowers on my nails 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.429
 have seen a photo on instagram 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.410
 this about 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.460
 and yes I'll try it myself 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.780
 I already have my nails here 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 painted that means ring and index finger 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.160
 in this color and the remaining nails 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 I will now first at a base 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.310
 seal or make code 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 to protect 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.590
 I like this mountain very much 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 I really like aids after that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.750
 with a white nailer kids run that is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 Also from sms super opaque really 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.020
 super cover so I'm but one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.780
 bit careful with white 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.129
 nail polish can be done very fast 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.370
 In any case, I do that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.370
 once 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.130
 as long as that dries now more 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960
 a piece of white paper and it drips 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.030
 Now nail polish on it because I 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.480
 need in there do points to 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.310
 do 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.590
 I have one here now that I can 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.840
 you linked below and the points 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.690
 now come offset on the ring finger 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.489
 so that it looks pretty evenly and 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.950
 you can make her big like I want 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 only just that easily makes 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.280
 on the index finger I want now 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.870
 I have one now 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.400
 small thin brushes has taken 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.070
 oh well that's a bit memorable 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.420
 tricky now I have a first two 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.460
 and then I have 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.220
 just use the nail polish brush 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.110
 really great there trying this 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.490
 actually get a lot of stripes 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
 you just can do it with the others 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 Cover and you can also with the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.120
 very small doping tool the strips 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.680
 even more precise on it and if you times 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.290
 what you painted about you can do that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.560
 farther away from a chopstick and nail polish 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.560
 do 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.299
 that's our interim result now 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.909
 have now taken piece of paper again 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.100
 as different red colored nail polishes 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.690
 clapped on it yes so I with the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.640
 brightest colors can begin 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.860
 I always take three points with it 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 It looks like I have so small 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.550
 herzchen that it said so the base for 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.649
 our floret which I distribute now 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.830
 on my nail and also on the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.869
 small loads thus the dark red 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.179
 nail polish I go back now to the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.540
 pool and that comes now on the sides 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.519
 From this bright red klicks taxi times 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.810
 okay always nice on the sides knows 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.580
 but in the semicircle that should form 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.610
 vary very well and I do that now 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.260
 also all the dots and in the middle 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.600
 then comes from this red point 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.130
 a dark red dot with white attempts 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.620
 I still have a little dimension 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.350
 there to bake but also yes and that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.700
 to give all a bit in turn 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.290
 because with can know everything must 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.989
 mix and if you come back with it now 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.060
 the red stock goes in the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.090
 color you pack on the white now 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.980
 much brighter and much more out sting 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.720
 and that gave a bit of an abstract look 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.030
 It is not really one now 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.920
 flower the dual know but you can 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.870
 yes always form around and then see 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.940
 that in the end of the far so yes 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 I have three variants like mine here 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.239
 I can now make these leaves 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.430
 me anyway for the dark green 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.540
 decided 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.130
 later realized that it was a bit too 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.790
 There was a lot when you could have two three 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.950
 leaflets would have sufficed yes I hope 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.630
 but not blame them so bad they 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.250
 that you do not mind but I have 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.750
 now there still wrapped in white 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.850
 in turn, dimensions a bit 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.680
 to take turns and with one 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.840
 I still have light green nail polish there 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 a little bit like the fresh one 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.829
 a little bit lighter and I am 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.420
 actually very satisfied with that 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.769
 on the right side you will find that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.780
 Now, just like me now 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.640
 I proceeded because I thought okay 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.470
 maybe it was a bit hard 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.880
 I have it all, too 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.280
 I also have flowers on 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.549
 my forefinger made a page 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.070
 about three flowers and yes that 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.470
 so the flowers technique so that I 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.870
 I know that this looks like now 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.840
 like a rose, but it's just you 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 the illusion is just such an illusion 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.110
 are 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.379
 Essens still has a top coat 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.319
 and I have now packed it 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.930
 Also very important also the top 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.670
 really from the nail and her 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.760
 you will have this rule for a week 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.620
 I love this gamestop and base and 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.090
 that actually already the finished one 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.930
 I still hope that the video design 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.180
 has fallen from 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.590
 I think that's the design and exactly on the left 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.239
 in the sentences video above can contact me 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.239
 yours and thanks for the audience
