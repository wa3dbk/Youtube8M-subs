00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
what I color correction used to look

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.260

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
like now i'm gonna go back to this and

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.150 
like now i'm gonna go back to this and
this<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.840> slightly<00:02:37.590> adjusted<00:02:38.040> it

a<00:02:41.069> little<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.340> more<00:02:41.459> contrast<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.300> for

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
a little bit more contrast in there for

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
a little bit more contrast in there for
that<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> guys<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.100> ahead<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.340> leave

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
that so i can do that as well so who

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.680 
that so i can do that as well so who
knows<00:04:26.280> we'll<00:04:26.880> see<00:04:27.030> what<00:04:27.180> happens<00:04:27.300> with

knows we'll see what happens with
that<00:04:27.810> but<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.200> gameplay<00:04:28.380> has<00:04:28.560> been<00:04:28.740> wrapping

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
that but the gameplay has been wrapping

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.380 
that but the gameplay has been wrapping
up<00:04:29.160> here<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.490> here<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:29.760> see<00:04:29.910> why<00:04:30.120> it's

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
up here and here we see why it's

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.000 
up here and here we see why it's
wrapping<00:04:30.780> up<00:04:30.900> here<00:04:31.050> because<00:04:31.170> we<00:04:31.470> actually<00:04:31.620> if

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
wrapping up here because we actually if

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.190 
wrapping up here because we actually if
you<00:04:32.100> look<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.310> score<00:04:32.520> winning<00:04:32.850> 114<00:04:33.450> 242<00:04:34.020> and
