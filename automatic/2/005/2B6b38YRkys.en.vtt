00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.680
 hello to all who visit the page 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.559
 web prepare yourself this video 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.990
 is to show you a small instrument 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.529
 or small homemade invention that I have designed 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.080
 to repair the pro valves 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.340
 washing machines or dishwashers the same as 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.310
 has already been commented on in other videos 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.710
 they have the failure to lose water but 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.250
 making them one oiled with oil 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.450
 dense or car oil for example 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.460
 we can save them in many 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.020
 Sometimes in another video I've already 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.780
 commented today I have explained how 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.519
 grease the solenoid valve and there is certain 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.710
 small invention with two plugs of 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.109
 drink bottles to apply a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.090
 soda bottle and be able to hook the 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.600
 you can see it in others of my previous ones 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 videos and in this case I want to innovate 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.699
 invent another small instrument that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 can also help us repair them 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.110
 electrovalves this instrument is a 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.719
 little more elaborate than the car that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.390
 I designed with two plugs and in this what 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.619
 we do is that with a bottle cap 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.770
 of soda 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.259
 we have applied a chamber valve 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.149
 of bicycle a camera that you have 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.950
 old streets could be scrapped because it 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.009
 has started that there is doing with prick 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.619
 is to discard because the event 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 simply then before throwing it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.210
 the bicycle cameras can 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 be worth for many small inventions the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.050
 contraption is nothing more than this one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.290
 valve applied to the inside of a plug 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.360
 today we have made a hole and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.909
 we have placed the valve let's see 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.979
 now how can you make it 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.229
 the steps for the construction of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.990
 utensil to repair solenoid valves 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.960
 of washing machine to be able to grease the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.329
 same is very simple I have used a 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.209
 soda bottle stopper is worth you 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.530
 any kind of bottle to it I've 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.569
 made a hole of about 78 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.549
 millimeters approximately so that 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:10.110
 the valve of the bicycle between just 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.239
 that is, when we try to put the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.519
 valve we have to force the same one 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.519
 little to go through the plug 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.959
 as you see 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.810
 and now proceed to cut the rubber to 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.540
 adapt it to some previous 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.890
 the during the bicycle cameras and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.069
 It has been used on different occasions 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 for different preparations the truth 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.740
 it is a material 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.660
 quite resistant that can serve us 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.280
 for different inventions for example 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.310
 to plug 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.550
 leaking water from pipes as an element 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 insulating 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.650
 as an element also avoids blows the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.920
 truth is that I use them for enough 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.690
 things also when you have prepared the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.880
 the rubber of the hatch of the washing machine 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.270
 why every time you meet is 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.160
 a roll or have a 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.650
 those years I skewer with the bicycle and the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 we can use save it because it deserves 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.360
 the penalty we will proceed 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.650
 to cut 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.360
 the hole in the plug 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 I think we cut approximately 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.870
 and now that we have 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.040
 the base more or less defined already 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:38.690
 it's just retouching the bottom to 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.690
 order to leave it to a measure 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.040
 it's not going inland and we can 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 wait for the same 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.230
 we found a little 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.280
 we will approve and if you are the measure already 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.280
 we can proceed to paste the capon 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.810
 we see that it is quite tight and 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.810
 now it's just pasting the same 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.900
 after performing different tests 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.560
 I have seen that the best option is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.750
 of the valve has much smaller 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.550
 that what is the mouth of the plug 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.070
 as you see this measure 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.670
 approximately so that in this way 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.670
 the valve seats the best possible and 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.040
 can be searched without difficulty in the 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.990
 valve 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.940
 to the direct valve we have to apply 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.240
 a little Teflon to keep from losing 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.240
 the air 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.270
 and as you can see, it's pretty good 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.870
 settled I will proceed to paste it and now 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.870
 Will be ready 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.310
 but the sin of the valve 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.439
 we will use glue type sky lead 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.960
 of instant dried voucher of any 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:10.000
 brand we will apply a little 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.000
 at the base of the valve 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.080
 and we introduce the same to the maximum 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.210
 you almost do not need the glue since 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.490
 the valve is very tight in the plug 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.550
 but it costs nothing to put a little bit of 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.180
 same so that the seal is much more 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.180
 efficient 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.910
 it only needs to dry and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.180
 we have our little point 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.320
 utensil to repair the extra valves 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.320
 of washing machines and dishwashers 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.000
 we will let it dry and proceed to 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.300
 check the same to see if it works 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.800
 correctly once already pasted and 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.450
 our little one would be finished 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.910
 accessory to repair 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.800
 solenoid valves would only lack one 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.980
 thing if we want to do it since not 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.280
 it is imperative and is to disassemble the howitzer 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.500
 inside the valve dismantling 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.840
 the howitzer we will get the flow of 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.780
 air passing through it is 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.050
 a little bigger and stronger than if 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:27.090
 has the howitzer installed therefore with 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:30.200
 fine flat- nose pliers 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.300
 we can take the howitzer 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.300
 and extract the same spinning 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.440
 once withdrawn the same the flow of 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.830
 air what will happen 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.050
 through the small utensil will be a 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.539
 little older 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.460
 and we can get more strength from 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.460
 drive to work 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.560
 we would place it in place of the tube 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.680
 water that I have placed in our 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.919
 moments but the test of the apparatus already 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.990
 we will see in another video a greeting and 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.370
 I hope you continue to visit the page 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.370
 web repair yourself
