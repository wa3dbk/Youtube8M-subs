our equipment for the staining is a big

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.330 
our equipment for the staining is a big
deal<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.739> seems<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> be

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

really favorable for our men we found
that<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> prowl<00:00:50.910> h2o<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.690> its<00:00:52.289> strength<00:00:52.620> for

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that the prowl h2o is its strength for

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.029 
that the prowl h2o is its strength for
us<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.180> grass<00:00:54.180> control<00:00:54.469> pros<00:00:55.469> Oh<00:00:55.620> millet<00:00:55.949> in

us is grass control pros Oh millet in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
us is grass control pros Oh millet in
particular<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.789> our<00:00:57.030> light<00:00:57.390> sandy<00:00:57.809> soils<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
particular on our light sandy soils so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
particular on our light sandy soils so
we<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> sandy<00:00:59.460> soil<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.059> farm

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
we have a lot of sandy soil in our farm

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.020 
we have a lot of sandy soil in our farm
mix<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> very<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.640> job<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
mix and it does a very good job on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
mix and it does a very good job on
controlling<00:01:03.570> grasses<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.070> type<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
controlling grasses in that type of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
controlling grasses in that type of
condition<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.180> proso<00:01:06.840> millet<00:01:06.869> has<00:01:07.170> been<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
condition that proso millet has been a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
condition that proso millet has been a
big<00:01:08.159> issue<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.729> us<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.360> many<00:01:09.570> many<00:01:09.780> years<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
big issue for us for many many years and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980 
big issue for us for many many years and
so<00:01:10.820> that's<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> reasons<00:01:12.540> why<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so that's one of the reasons why we

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.190 
so that's one of the reasons why we
started<00:01:13.380> using<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.070> our<00:01:14.189> soybeans<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.939> well

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
started using it in our soybeans as well

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
started using it in our soybeans as well
just<00:01:16.200> because<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:17.100> wanted<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> keep<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:18.210> clean

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
just because we wanted to keep get clean

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
just because we wanted to keep get clean
fields<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.439> clean<00:01:19.740> fields<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
fields and get clean fields from the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600 
fields and get clean fields from the
get-go<00:01:20.960> research<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.200> shown<00:01:22.409> us<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.680> clean

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
get-go research has shown us that clean

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
get-go research has shown us that clean
fields<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> beginning<00:01:24.450> stages<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> crop

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
fields in the beginning stages of crop

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
fields in the beginning stages of crop
development<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.939> good<00:01:27.240> return<00:01:27.509> on

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
development is a good return on

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.770 
development is a good return on
investment<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.400> why<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
investment and so that's why we are you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
investment and so that's why we are you
know<00:01:30.900> using<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.380> much<00:01:31.500> Park<00:01:31.799> Pro<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.909> many

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
used prowl h2o on about 700 acres of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.059 
used prowl h2o on about 700 acres of
corn<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.599> soil<00:02:09.599> type<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.080> generally<00:02:10.470> sandy

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
corn and soil type is generally sandy

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.950 
corn and soil type is generally sandy
and<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.310> air

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and this air

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.290 
and this air
with<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.770> little<00:02:13.010> bit<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.190> heavy<00:02:13.580> soil<00:02:13.880> mixed<00:02:14.180> in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
with a little bit of heavy soil mixed in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.390 
with a little bit of heavy soil mixed in
this<00:02:14.810> new<00:02:15.020> product<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.590> much<00:02:15.830> easier<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.280> work

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
this new product is much easier to work

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.640 
this new product is much easier to work
with<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.820> doesn't<00:02:17.000> stain<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:17.750> much<00:02:17.960> as<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.500> old

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
with it doesn't stain so much as the old

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.000 
with it doesn't stain so much as the old
product<00:02:19.040> bid<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.390> therefore<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:21.170> find<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:21.830> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
product bid and so therefore I find it a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.220 
product bid and so therefore I find it a
lot<00:02:22.160> easier<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.640> work<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:22.850> for<00:02:23.660> all<00:02:23.720> h2o<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
lot easier to work with for all h2o I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.120 
lot easier to work with for all h2o I
like<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.740> because<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.220> tank<00:02:25.910> mix<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.330> with

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
like it because I can tank mix it with

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.890 
like it because I can tank mix it with
the<00:02:28.130> glyphosate<00:02:28.370> product<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.270> then<00:02:29.540> it's

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the glyphosate product and then it's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.130 
the glyphosate product and then it's
just<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.320> one<00:02:30.530> pass<00:02:31.390> deal<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.960> and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
just a one pass deal and then you and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.480 
just a one pass deal and then you and
then<00:02:33.230> you're<00:02:33.380> done<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.250> peace

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
then you're done and you have that peace

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.270 
then you're done and you have that peace
of<00:02:34.520> mind<00:02:34.910> for<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.480> year<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.130> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
of mind for the year because I like it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.760 
of mind for the year because I like it
because<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.270> has<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.450> residual<00:02:39.200> value<00:02:39.590> in

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
because it has that residual value in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.520 
because it has that residual value in
there<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.760> keep<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.180> weeds<00:02:41.390> down<00:02:41.530> using
