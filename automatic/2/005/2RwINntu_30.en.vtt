I usually put my foot right before the
front<00:00:48.280> bolt<00:00:48.809> sometimes<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:50.020> put<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.350> higher<00:00:50.620> up

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
front bolt sometimes I put it higher up

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.819 
front bolt sometimes I put it higher up
sometimes<00:00:52.030> effort<00:00:52.390> forward<00:00:52.690> it's<00:00:53.469> advisable

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
sometimes effort forward it's advisable

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.100 
sometimes effort forward it's advisable
for<00:00:54.100> beginners<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.910> hang<00:00:55.149> there<00:00:55.450> to<00:00:55.629> peel<00:00:56.050> off

for beginners to hang there to peel off
the<00:00:56.289> board<00:00:56.710> more<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:58.809> expert<00:00:59.260> would

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
the board more and an expert would

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.369 
the board more and an expert would
because<00:00:59.950> it's<00:01:00.670> much<00:01:01.030> easier<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.510> flip<00:01:01.840> if<00:01:02.110> your

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
because it's much easier to flip if your

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.189 
because it's much easier to flip if your
hero<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.739> hanging<00:01:03.100> off<00:01:03.250> your<00:01:03.399> board<00:01:03.610> more<00:01:04.199> but
