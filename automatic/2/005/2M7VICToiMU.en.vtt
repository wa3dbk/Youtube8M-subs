a<00:00:03.980> lot<00:00:04.550> of<00:00:04.670> times<00:00:04.850> you<00:00:05.000> want<00:00:05.120> to<00:00:05.240> check<00:00:05.479> your

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
a lot of times you want to check your

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.960 
a lot of times you want to check your
stator<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:06.410> do<00:00:06.500> the<00:00:06.620> AC<00:00:06.800> voltage<00:00:07.279> test<00:00:07.849> I'm

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
stator and do the AC voltage test I'm

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.890 
stator and do the AC voltage test I'm
going<00:00:08.090> to<00:00:08.149> show<00:00:08.240> you<00:00:08.269> how<00:00:08.360> to<00:00:08.420> do<00:00:08.570> that<00:00:08.720> real

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
going to show you how to do that real

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.370 
going to show you how to do that real
quick

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
quick

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.410 
quick
remember<00:00:09.740> it's<00:00:09.860> AC<00:00:10.010> voltage<00:00:10.610> it's<00:00:11.180> not<00:00:11.300> going

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
remember it's AC voltage it's not going

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.759 
remember it's AC voltage it's not going
to<00:00:11.480> be<00:00:11.540> real<00:00:11.720> high<00:00:11.870> voltage<00:00:12.290> and<00:00:12.320> let<00:00:12.530> you<00:00:12.650> get

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
to be real high voltage and let you get

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.160 
to be real high voltage and let you get
your<00:00:12.860> R's<00:00:13.160> really<00:00:13.760> high<00:00:13.970> but<00:00:14.180> just<00:00:14.390> be<00:00:14.780> careful

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
your R's really high but just be careful

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.300 
your R's really high but just be careful
don't<00:00:15.260> cross<00:00:15.500> any<00:00:15.680> wires<00:00:15.769> or<00:00:16.340> arc<00:00:16.550> anything

don't cross any wires or arc anything

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.279 
don't cross any wires or arc anything
imagine<00:00:19.310> this<00:00:19.519> right<00:00:19.999> here<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:20.779> is<00:00:20.839> bolted

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
imagine this right here this is bolted

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.079 
imagine this right here this is bolted
down<00:00:21.439> on<00:00:21.650> my<00:00:21.740> table<00:00:22.460> for<00:00:22.489> hooking<00:00:22.880> up

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
down on my table for hooking up

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.729 
down on my table for hooking up
regulators<00:00:23.570> but<00:00:23.720> imagine<00:00:24.140> this<00:00:24.230> is<00:00:24.380> just<00:00:24.409> your

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
regulators but imagine this is just your

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.919 
regulators but imagine this is just your
three<00:00:25.009> prong<00:00:25.249> connector<00:00:25.539> coming<00:00:26.539> from<00:00:26.720> your

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
three prong connector coming from your

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.649 
three prong connector coming from your
stator<00:00:27.259> that<00:00:27.919> plugs<00:00:28.310> into<00:00:28.609> your<00:00:28.699> regulator<00:00:29.239> so

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
stator that plugs into your regulator so

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.710 
stator that plugs into your regulator so
I'm<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:29.989> going<00:00:30.109> to<00:00:30.199> use<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:31.069> show<00:00:31.279> you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
I'm just going to use this to show you

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880 
I'm just going to use this to show you
what<00:00:32.720> happens<00:00:33.079> when<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.290> check<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:33.530> remember

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
what happens when you check I remember

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.400 
what happens when you check I remember
your<00:00:34.010> voltmeter<00:00:34.460> has<00:00:35.030> got<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.359> be<00:00:35.449> on<00:00:35.600> AC

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
your voltmeter has got to be on AC

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.400 
your voltmeter has got to be on AC
alternating<00:00:37.219> current<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.840> put<00:00:39.079> it<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
alternating current and I put it on the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.279 
alternating current and I put it on the
200<00:00:40.010> volt<00:00:40.489> meter<00:00:41.179> and<00:00:41.300> set<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.809> 20<00:00:42.170> volt

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
200 volt meter and set it like a 20 volt

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.470 
200 volt meter and set it like a 20 volt
meter<00:00:42.559> because<00:00:42.769> it<00:00:43.429> can<00:00:43.609> get<00:00:43.730> up<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.449> know

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
meter because it can get up to you know

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.319 
meter because it can get up to you know
80<00:00:45.050> 90<00:00:45.230> volts<00:00:45.710> I've<00:00:45.949> seen<00:00:46.160> I've<00:00:46.250> seen<00:00:46.280> 95<00:00:46.910> volts

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
80 90 volts I've seen I've seen 95 volts

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.099 
80 90 volts I've seen I've seen 95 volts
so<00:00:47.870> just<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:49.670> know<00:00:49.699> beware<00:00:50.510> don't<00:00:50.719> put<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:50.989> at

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
so just you know beware don't put it at

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.150 
so just you know beware don't put it at
20<00:00:51.410> because<00:00:51.589> you're<00:00:51.679> going<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:51.890> hurt<00:00:52.010> your

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
20 because you're going to hurt your

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000 
20 because you're going to hurt your
meter<00:00:52.339> so<00:00:52.579> put<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:52.850> at<00:00:52.969> 200<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.750> AC<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.859> we'll

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
meter so put it at 200 on AC and we'll

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:04.819 
meter so put it at 200 on AC and we'll
do<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.280> check<00:00:55.550> here<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:55.850> go

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.219 

okay<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.579> across<00:01:05.820> two<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.929> the<00:01:06.990> wires

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
okay I'm going across two of the wires

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.980 
okay I'm going across two of the wires
okay

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
okay

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.770 
okay
to<00:01:09.500> get<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:09.979> we<00:01:10.070> got<00:01:10.689> 22<00:01:12.250> 22<00:01:13.250> 8<00:01:13.460> ok<00:01:14.149> now<00:01:14.630> I'm

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
to get it and we got 22 22 8 ok now I'm

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.320 
to get it and we got 22 22 8 ok now I'm
going<00:01:14.960> over<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.380> another<00:01:15.740> one<00:01:16.240> all<00:01:17.240> right

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
going over to another one all right

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.710 
going over to another one all right
because<00:01:17.450> we're<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.810> check<00:01:18.020> all<00:01:18.200> three

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
because we're going to check all three

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.710 
because we're going to check all three
and<00:01:19.810> we<00:01:20.260> have<00:01:20.490> 22:7<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:22.150> now<00:01:22.420> I'm<00:01:22.540> going<00:01:22.660> to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
and we have 22:7 and now I'm going to

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.300 
and we have 22:7 and now I'm going to
move<00:01:22.870> over<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.440> I'm<00:01:23.560> going<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.770> check<00:01:24.010> now

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
move over and I'm going to check now

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.859 
move over and I'm going to check now
this<00:01:24.550> will<00:01:24.700> be<00:01:24.760> all<00:01:24.880> three<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.360> I'm<00:01:25.480> checking

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
this will be all three that I'm checking

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.450 
this will be all three that I'm checking
okay<00:01:27.439> 22<00:01:28.009> 8<00:01:28.219> so<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.420> particular<00:01:30.429> set<00:01:31.429> of

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
okay 22 8 so this particular set of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490 
okay 22 8 so this particular set of
windings<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:32.179> great<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.289> close

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
windings is great that is really close

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.050 
windings is great that is really close
I'm<00:01:33.710> going<00:01:33.859> to<00:01:33.920> go<00:01:34.189> up<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.369> little<00:01:34.399> higher<00:01:34.640> just

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
I'm going to go up a little higher just

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.120 
I'm going to go up a little higher just
to<00:01:35.149> show<00:01:35.359> you<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:35.689> happens<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.950> same

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
to show you what happens so the same

that<00:02:06.950> means<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:07.400> these<00:02:07.730> three<00:02:08.000> windings<00:02:08.330> in

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
that means this these three windings in

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.010 
that means this these three windings in
this<00:02:09.259> particular<00:02:09.649> stator<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:11.030> really<00:02:11.720> close

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
this particular stator are really close

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.690 
this particular stator are really close
and<00:02:12.290> really<00:02:12.380> nice<00:02:12.800> there's<00:02:13.310> going<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.520> be<00:02:13.580> a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and really nice there's going to be a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.250 
and really nice there's going to be a
little<00:02:14.090> difference<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:14.750> why<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> had<00:02:15.110> like

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
little difference that's why I had like

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.960 
little difference that's why I had like
point<00:02:15.560> one<00:02:15.770> difference<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.430> might<00:02:16.580> have

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
point one difference but you might have

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.370 
point one difference but you might have
a<00:02:17.000> little<00:02:17.240> more<00:02:17.540> not<00:02:17.750> much<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.170> shouldn't

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
a little more not much you shouldn't

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.780 
a little more not much you shouldn't
have<00:02:18.530> much<00:02:18.680> difference<00:02:19.130> between<00:02:19.460> because<00:02:19.670> it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
have much difference between because it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.430 
have much difference between because it
should<00:02:19.940> be<00:02:20.000> pretty<00:02:20.180> close<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:21.290> how

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
should be pretty close but that's how

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.700 
should be pretty close but that's how
you<00:02:21.470> check<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:22.270> AC<00:02:23.270> windings<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.200> by<00:02:24.350> doing

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
you check your AC windings is by doing

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.310 
you check your AC windings is by doing
it<00:02:24.860> make<00:02:25.100> sure<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.490> AC<00:02:25.850> if<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.080> one

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
it make sure it's on AC if you have one

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.720 
it make sure it's on AC if you have one
if<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.920> know<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.370> one<00:02:28.610> that's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
if you know if you have one that's

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.850 
if you know if you have one that's
showing<00:02:29.290> twenty-five<00:02:30.290> eight<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.800> another

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
showing twenty-five eight and another

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.180 
showing twenty-five eight and another
125<00:02:31.520> seven<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.420> one<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.660> shows<00:02:32.950> 19<00:02:33.950> eight

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
125 seven and one that shows 19 eight

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.540 
125 seven and one that shows 19 eight
okay<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:36.770> balanced<00:02:37.220> very<00:02:37.430> well

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
okay it's just not balanced very well

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.600 
okay it's just not balanced very well
it's<00:02:37.970> probably<00:02:38.150> working<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.100> charging<00:02:40.100> but

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
it's probably working and charging but

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.130 
it's probably working and charging but
it's<00:02:40.880> not<00:02:41.180> perfect

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's not perfect

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.290 
it's not perfect
okay<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.680> know<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.340> if<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.580> get<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.120> all

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
okay so just know that if you get if all

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.760 
okay so just know that if you get if all
your<00:02:44.450> windings<00:02:44.840> are<00:02:44.959> very<00:02:45.230> close<00:02:45.530> together

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
your windings are very close together

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.860 
your windings are very close together
and<00:02:46.280> they<00:02:46.370> go<00:02:46.550> up<00:02:46.580> when<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.090> turn<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.780> know

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
and they go up when you turn you know

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.080 
and they go up when you turn you know
you<00:02:47.959> rev<00:02:48.140> your<00:02:48.260> motors<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:49.400> bring<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.730> item<00:02:49.970> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you rev your motors a bring the item a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.430 
you rev your motors a bring the item a
little<00:02:50.300> bit<00:02:50.390> higher<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.780> check<00:02:50.990> them<00:02:51.110> again

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
little bit higher and check them again

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.690 
little bit higher and check them again
and<00:02:51.620> they<00:02:51.709> all<00:02:51.860> come<00:02:52.040> up<00:02:52.100> good

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and they all come up good

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.060 
and they all come up good
they're<00:02:53.480> probably<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.930> good<00:02:54.170> shape<00:02:54.470> as<00:02:54.740> far<00:02:54.770> as

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
they're probably in good shape as far as

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.930 
they're probably in good shape as far as
that<00:02:55.250> again<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.390> doesn't<00:02:56.930> say<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.220> your

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
that again it doesn't say that your

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.480 
that again it doesn't say that your
stator<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.660> not<00:02:59.959> weak<00:03:00.350> in<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:01.160> way<00:03:01.340> or<00:03:01.370> another

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
stator is not weak in one way or another

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.640 
stator is not weak in one way or another
like<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:01.970> said<00:03:02.150> early<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.570> video<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.470> could

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
like I said early in the video it could

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.100 
like I said early in the video it could
be<00:03:03.770> putting<00:03:04.010> out<00:03:04.190> volts<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:04.910> fine<00:03:05.180> but<00:03:05.840> just

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
be putting out volts just fine but just

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.900 
be putting out volts just fine but just
not<00:03:06.260> enough<00:03:06.560> power<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:07.190> not<00:03:07.400> enough<00:03:07.580> push

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
not enough power just not enough push

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.870 
not enough power just not enough push
you<00:03:08.330> know<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:09.010> charge<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.160> battery<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.640> do

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
you know to charge the battery and do

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.190 
you know to charge the battery and do
all<00:03:10.970> your<00:03:11.000> electrical<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.810> anyway

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
all your electrical so anyway

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.540 
all your electrical so anyway
that's<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.680> another<00:03:12.890> check<00:03:13.130> people<00:03:13.430> have

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
that's just another check people have

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.460 
that's just another check people have
asked<00:03:13.760> me<00:03:13.820> about<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:14.930> thought<00:03:15.140> I'd<00:03:15.290> show

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
asked me about and so I thought I'd show

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.280 
asked me about and so I thought I'd show
you<00:03:15.530> okay<00:03:16.040> hope<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:16.730> helped<00:03:17.030> again<00:03:17.390> thanks

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
you okay hope this helped again thanks

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.360 
you okay hope this helped again thanks
