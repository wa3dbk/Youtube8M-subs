we're going to try both of them to see
which<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.250> works<00:00:38.370> better<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.450> shoe<00:00:40.050> box<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
which one works better a shoe box is

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.510 
which one works better a shoe box is
really<00:00:43.140> good<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.559> any<00:00:43.829> small<00:00:43.950> size<00:00:44.309> box

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
really good for this any small size box

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.270 
really good for this any small size box
that<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.910> stick<00:00:45.480> or<00:00:45.750> shine<00:00:46.710> the

that you can stick or shine the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.470 
that you can stick or shine the
flashlight<00:00:47.750> through<00:00:50.059> this<00:00:51.059> works<00:00:51.300> really

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
flashlight through this works really

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.540 
flashlight through this works really
well<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.350> box<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> New<00:00:53.190> Balance

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
well on this box this is a New Balance

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
well on this box this is a New Balance
shoe<00:00:54.000> box<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.420> already<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> hole<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
shoe box it already has a hole in it so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
shoe box it already has a hole in it so
we<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.699> stick<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.030> egg<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
we can stick an egg right in there to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.520 
we can stick an egg right in there to
have<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> light<00:00:59.789> shine<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:00.530> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
have the light shine through this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
have the light shine through this
flashlight<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:02.340> sit<00:01:02.789> flat<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
flashlight would sit flat in it so you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.060 
flashlight would sit flat in it so you
would<00:01:04.710> make<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.070> hole<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.270> top<00:01:07.070> instead

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
would make your hole here on top instead

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
would make your hole here on top instead
of<00:01:08.130> through<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> we're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> try

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
of through there so we're going to try

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.270 
of through there so we're going to try
this<00:01:11.130> way

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.100 

and<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:19.880> said<00:01:19.940> these<00:01:20.270> batteries<00:01:20.690> are<00:01:20.810> kind

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and like I said these batteries are kind

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.870 
and like I said these batteries are kind
of<00:01:21.229> weak<00:01:21.409> right<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.250> they're<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.549> shining

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
of weak right now so they're not shining

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:33.670 
of weak right now so they're not shining
through<00:01:24.280> terrifically<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:33.350> do<00:01:33.530> this

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
through terrifically you can do this

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.359

from<00:02:21.079> trade<00:02:21.290> turning<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> heat<00:02:21.829> up<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.130> high

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
from trade turning the heat up so high

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.610 
from trade turning the heat up so high
when<00:02:22.549> i<00:02:22.610> founded<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.060> was<00:02:23.269> maybe<00:02:23.480> 120<00:02:24.290> degrees

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
when i founded it was maybe 120 degrees

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.979 
when i founded it was maybe 120 degrees
it<00:02:25.549> said<00:02:25.610> worse<00:02:25.910> for<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> good<00:02:26.420> egg<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:26.840> would

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
it said worse for a good egg you would

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.039 
it said worse for a good egg you would
see<00:02:27.200> veins<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:29.120> through<00:02:29.329> here<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:29.930> this

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
see veins going through here and at this

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.360 
see veins going through here and at this
point<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.440> would<00:02:30.590> actually<00:02:30.950> probably<00:02:31.100> be

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
point you would actually probably be

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.350 
point you would actually probably be
able<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.640> see<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:33.140> pulsating<00:02:33.910> from<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.180> heart

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
able to see the pulsating from the heart

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.870 
able to see the pulsating from the heart
so<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.709> try<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.920> dark<00:02:37.280> egg<00:02:37.549> this<00:02:37.760> is

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
so we're going to try a dark egg this is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.600 
so we're going to try a dark egg this is
a<00:02:37.910> white<00:02:38.150> egg<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:43.070> reason<00:02:43.370> for<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
a white egg and the reason for the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.020 
a white egg and the reason for the
candling<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.590> these<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:46.040> explode

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.960 

inside<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:49.990> incubator<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.530> make<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.770> mess

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
inside your incubator and make a mess

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780 
inside your incubator and make a mess
now<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.150> egg<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.540> dark<00:02:52.810> egg<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.550> think

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
now this egg is a dark egg and I think

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.640 
now this egg is a dark egg and I think
we<00:02:54.910> need<00:02:55.030> more<00:02:55.090> light<00:02:55.450> coming<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:55.840> or<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
we need more light coming through or the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.780 
we need more light coming through or the
darker<00:02:56.980> room<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:59.650> room<00:02:59.709> has<00:03:00.190> just<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.640> mini

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
darker room this room has just the mini

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.130 
darker room this room has just the mini
blinds<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.300> window<00:03:01.600> isn't<00:03:01.810> too<00:03:02.020> much

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
blinds on the window isn't too much

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.190 
blinds on the window isn't too much
lights<00:03:02.410> coming<00:03:02.650> through<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:04.510> may<00:03:04.690> be<00:03:04.720> able<00:03:05.020> to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
lights coming through we may be able to

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.290 
lights coming through we may be able to
try<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.489> your<00:03:06.640> hand<00:03:06.970> cupped

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
try this with just your hand cupped

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.330 
try this with just your hand cupped
around<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.690> top<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.110> flashlight<00:03:08.530> shining

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
around the top of the flashlight shining

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.370 
around the top of the flashlight shining
through<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.670> egg<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.840> we're<00:03:10.989> going<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.230> try

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
through the egg so we're going to try

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.729 
through the egg so we're going to try
that<00:03:11.590> also<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:13.060> I'll<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.420> go<00:03:13.600> through<00:03:13.930> some

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
that also but I'll just go through some

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.740 
that also but I'll just go through some
of<00:03:14.770> these<00:03:14.980> without<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.819> video<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.569> will

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
of these without the video on and I will

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.970 
of these without the video on and I will
show<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:16.989> when<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.530> find<00:03:17.800> one<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.980> okay

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
show you when I find one that is okay

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.000 
show you when I find one that is okay
now<00:03:21.550> here's<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.940> white<00:03:22.180> egg<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.769> one<00:03:23.920> is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
now here's a white egg and this one is

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.449 
now here's a white egg and this one is
showing<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.550> lot<00:03:24.700> better<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.100> just

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
showing up a lot better this is just

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.770 
showing up a lot better this is just
still<00:03:27.640> in<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.850> same<00:03:28.030> room<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.480> can<00:03:28.630> see

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
still in the same room but you can see

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.430 
still in the same room but you can see
the<00:03:28.900> veins<00:03:29.080> in<00:03:29.320> there<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:30.160> is<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.370> developing

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the veins in there this is a developing

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
the veins in there this is a developing
chicken

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.040 

and<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:37.140> looks<00:03:37.440> like

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.900 

you<00:03:41.560> might<00:03:41.770> be<00:03:41.950> moving<00:03:42.100> around<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.700> there

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
you might be moving around in there

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.290 
you might be moving around in there
because<00:03:43.330> i<00:03:43.600> read<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.080> the<00:03:45.070> light<00:03:45.910> from<00:03:46.120> the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
because i read that the light from the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.030 
because i read that the light from the
flashlight<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.870> stimulate<00:03:47.110> them

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.209 

you<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.790> kind<00:03:53.969> of<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.329> shadow<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.870> there

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.219 
you can kind of see that shadow up there

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.580 
you can kind of see that shadow up there
but<00:03:56.219> this<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.549> good<00:03:56.790> egg<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:58.230> we'll<00:03:58.439> keep

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
but this is a good egg so we'll keep

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.679 
but this is a good egg so we'll keep
watching<00:03:58.829> them<00:03:59.189> and<00:03:59.459> we're<00:04:00.060> going<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.209> candle

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
watching them and we're going to candle

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.390 
watching them and we're going to candle
them<00:04:00.890> about<00:04:01.890> every<00:04:02.370> week<00:04:03.269> we're<00:04:04.250> about<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.310> week

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
them about every week we're about a week

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.580 
them about every week we're about a week
and<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.849> half<00:04:05.879> into<00:04:06.299> this<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.989> you're<00:04:07.379> supposed

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
and a half into this and you're supposed

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.929 
and a half into this and you're supposed
to<00:04:07.709> candle<00:04:08.010> Oh<00:04:08.099> match<00:04:08.250> between<00:04:08.609> five<00:04:08.909> and

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
to candle Oh match between five and

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.880 
to candle Oh match between five and
seven<00:04:09.390> days<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:11.090> we've<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.299> been<00:04:12.450> busying

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
seven days and we've just been busying

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.129 
seven days and we've just been busying
things<00:04:13.890> so<00:04:14.159> this<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.970> is<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.209> good<00:04:15.510> good

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
things so this is it this is a good good

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.259 
things so this is it this is a good good
egg<00:04:16.320> it'll<00:04:16.949> go<00:04:17.039> back<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.459> incubator<00:04:17.699> in

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
egg it'll go back in the incubator in

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.990 
egg it'll go back in the incubator in
about<00:04:18.539> two<00:04:18.750> weeks<00:04:18.780> we'll<00:04:19.139> have<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:20.000> little

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
about two weeks we'll have a little

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.460 
about two weeks we'll have a little
chick<00:04:21.269> hatched<00:04:21.479> from<00:04:21.600> that<00:04:21.810> hopefully<00:04:22.229> so

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
chick hatched from that hopefully so

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.850 
chick hatched from that hopefully so
there's<00:04:23.100> my<00:04:23.250> egg<00:04:23.400> candling<00:04:23.789> trick<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:25.229> I

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
there's my egg candling trick and I

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.499 
there's my egg candling trick and I
didn't<00:04:26.099> have<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.370> go<00:04:26.460> buy<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.639> fancy<00:04:26.910> flashlight

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
didn't have to go buy a fancy flashlight

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.720 
didn't have to go buy a fancy flashlight
or<00:04:27.630> anything
