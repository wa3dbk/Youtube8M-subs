lost<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.599> little<00:03:15.720> bit<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.959> steam<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.650> little<00:03:16.709> bit

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
lost a little bit of steam a little bit

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.220 
lost a little bit of steam a little bit
of<00:03:17.129> value<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.700> mean<00:03:18.060> Dean<00:03:18.239> Ambrose<00:03:18.599> has<00:03:18.750> done<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
of value I mean Dean Ambrose has done a

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.349 
of value I mean Dean Ambrose has done a
great<00:03:19.530> job<00:03:19.560> holding<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.160> title<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> think

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
great job holding that title but I think

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.970 
great job holding that title but I think
it<00:03:21.419> could<00:03:21.450> have<00:03:21.630> been<00:03:21.720> better<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.260> don't<00:03:22.889> know

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
it could have been better I don't know

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.089 
it could have been better I don't know
my<00:03:23.940> opinion<00:03:24.500> they<00:03:25.500> should<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.889> rid<00:03:26.069> of

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
my opinion they should not get rid of

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.409 
my opinion they should not get rid of
the<00:03:26.220> Intercontinental<00:03:26.730> title<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.239> was<00:03:27.389> a

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
the Intercontinental title that was a

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.240 
the Intercontinental title that was a
mistake<00:03:27.569> they<00:03:27.930> did<00:03:28.109> before<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.680> don't<00:03:29.099> think

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
mistake they did before I don't think

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.319 
mistake they did before I don't think
they<00:03:29.310> should<00:03:29.340> make<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.760> same<00:03:29.970> mistake<00:03:30.000> again
