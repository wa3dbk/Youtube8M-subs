00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.710
 hello guys on the win side of the gildo river would consist of talking 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.430
 of a very interesting subject the iphone users and in day to eptg that 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.109
 is navigation on web pages that contain content in 3d or 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.440
 something less a feature or even 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.779
 advertisements 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 but have in many cases caesar navigation was 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429
 well impaired 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.429
 ivo pink device with other browsers 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 give a touch 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.600
 there the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.710
 why it just does not come back reflects material 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 by indication of a reader 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.220
 I found 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.480
 This one 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.140
 browser here 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 finally or 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 let isis pivot sympathetic 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.150
 What is interesting this time the pain it wakes up any content in 3d 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.430
 both that on the laugh page is for example 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 so here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.630
 you can 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.369
 navigate quietly 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.270
 reflects 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.310
 Let's load the page. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.580
 are referents 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.590
 so I think you'll see 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.030
 this part here central 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.160
 Do you have flash content? 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.660
 she normally went 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.590
 propagating here 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.290
 no such blog too 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.790
 and any content 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.570
 be advertising hand 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.520
 the wheel perfectly that I 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.430
 I did the test in several web pages can navigate quietly 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.620
 I felt a little more people give 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.500
 See here to run the page is not so fast anymore 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.970
 is loading platinum then 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 to me it is already a great club the great favorable point the great positive point 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.500
 company can also count on one foot in the fence 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.550
 now balls 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.250
 seeing here 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.840
 that's when you have 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.420
 the historical is not 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.169
 Interesting 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.259
 who communicated his company to 0 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.019
 and still here in this other icon you have a series d 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.459
 features of a keyboard to add favorites to the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 general configurations in general 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.339
 he is a very browser 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.439
 fast 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.589
 I could open good places here. 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.889
 are few and dry but it obliges until a 5 6 ends without big problems 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.019
 ef 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.179
 you can open any page 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:50.449
 what is the most interesting test both the mpd version and the version 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.719
 boabaid 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.689
 the two of them perfectly 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.489
 So 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.969
 if you have problems with flash and not that is to use the iphone I'll be with 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.180
 Difficulties in using iphone in doha and ask is on account of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.849
 navigation of document missing estimates navigation 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.969
 you can test this browser for sure 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:13.620
 Are you going to solve your problem? 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.999
 marquis remembers the 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 the delicate moment 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.329
 the boy example said at last 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.180
 just download this is paid more was not nothing expensive absurd 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.180
 follows the goal line of the price of the applications 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.389
 the identity of the king 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.129
 birsa to have the possibility of day navigation 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.349
 complex pages 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.379
 already makes it worth it already 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.529
 for investments, no matter how precise 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.929
 but this is not the carolin berger is a very low price 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.579
 so thick to 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.259
 and be another video 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.879

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.369

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.199
