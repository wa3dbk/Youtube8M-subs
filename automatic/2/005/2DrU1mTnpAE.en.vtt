00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.320 
so having the 20,000 Leagues Under the
Sea<00:03:38.980> symbol<00:03:39.980> inside<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.520> tree<00:03:40.700> made<00:03:40.910> sense<00:03:41.180> it

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
Sea symbol inside the tree made sense it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.370 
Sea symbol inside the tree made sense it
was<00:03:41.390> an<00:03:41.660> homage<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:44.080> matched<00:03:45.080> up<00:03:45.350> perfectly

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
was an homage that matched up perfectly

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.680 
was an homage that matched up perfectly
with<00:03:45.860> reality<00:03:46.490> because<00:03:46.760> we<00:03:46.910> are<00:03:47.030> on<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.420> spot

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
with reality because we are on the spot

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.750 
with reality because we are on the spot
here<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:48.350> where<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.920> loading<00:03:49.160> dock<00:03:49.340> had<00:03:49.550> been

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
here of where the loading dock had been

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.840 
here of where the loading dock had been
for<00:03:50.120> 20,000<00:03:50.690> Leagues<00:03:50.840> Under<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.170> Sea<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.980 
for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea a
couple<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:52.910> shots<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.300> what<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.570> area<00:03:53.810> and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
couple of shots of what that area and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.540 
couple of shots of what that area and
the<00:03:54.110> playful<00:03:54.500> spot<00:03:54.740> looked<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
the playful spot looked like in the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.670 
the playful spot looked like in the
evenings<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.270> so<00:03:56.810> had<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.020> water<00:03:57.230> turned<00:03:57.530> on

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
middle here now if you've not seen this

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:43.499 
middle here now if you've not seen this
before<00:04:41.650> I'm<00:04:42.219> not<00:04:42.370> too<00:04:42.550> surprised<00:04:42.999> this<00:04:43.389> is

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
before I'm not too surprised this is

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.050 
before I'm not too surprised this is
something<00:04:43.689> that<00:04:43.840> was<00:04:44.439> built<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.789> opened

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
something that was built and it opened

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.920 
something that was built and it opened
up<00:04:46.150> for<00:04:46.449> one<00:04:47.020> day<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:48.340> on<00:04:48.639> that<00:04:48.789> one<00:04:48.999> day<00:04:49.270> kids

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
up for one day and on that one day kids

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.170 
up for one day and on that one day kids
were<00:04:50.080> able<00:04:50.319> to<00:04:50.499> bounce<00:04:51.069> around<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.759> on<00:04:51.999> this

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
were able to bounce around and on this

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.269 
were able to bounce around and on this
these<00:04:52.509> little<00:04:52.779> pads<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.379> so<00:04:53.860> these<00:04:53.979> pads

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
these little pads and so these pads

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.129 
these little pads and so these pads
would<00:04:54.939> sink<00:04:55.240> down<00:04:55.419> there<00:04:55.629> just<00:04:55.779> bring<00:04:55.960> down

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
would sink down there just bring down

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.379 
would sink down there just bring down
below<00:04:56.409> them<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:57.610> you<00:04:57.699> jumped<00:04:57.999> up<00:04:58.150> the

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
below them and if you jumped up the

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.029 
below them and if you jumped up the
spring<00:04:59.050> wouldn't<00:04:59.319> mean<00:04:59.409> that<00:04:59.439> you<00:04:59.590> jumped<00:04:59.860> up

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
spring wouldn't mean that you jumped up

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.760 
spring wouldn't mean that you jumped up
a<00:05:00.129> little<00:05:00.340> bit<00:05:00.460> just<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.729> little<00:05:00.759> bit<00:05:01.060> faster<00:05:01.449> so

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
a little bit just a little bit faster so

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.379 
a little bit just a little bit faster so
it<00:05:02.770> was<00:05:02.919> probably<00:05:03.249> deemed<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:04.090> little

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
it was probably deemed a little

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.179 
it was probably deemed a little
dangerous<00:05:04.930> because<00:05:05.439> it<00:05:05.650> wasn't<00:05:05.919> opened

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
dangerous because it wasn't opened

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.429 
dangerous because it wasn't opened
beyond<00:05:06.400> just<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.759> one<00:05:06.969> day<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:08.289> there's

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
beyond just that one day and there's

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.050 
beyond just that one day and there's
this<00:05:08.560> little<00:05:08.740> ball<00:05:09.039> that<00:05:09.339> references<00:05:09.999> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
this little ball that references the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.459 
this little ball that references the
Tigger<00:05:10.389> thing<00:05:10.599> as<00:05:10.719> well<00:05:10.900> as<00:05:11.020> well<00:05:11.289> as<00:05:11.379> the

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
Tigger thing as well as well as the

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:12.959 
Tigger thing as well as well as the
spring<00:05:11.830> here<00:05:12.099> and<00:05:12.249> then<00:05:12.610> they<00:05:12.699> started

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
spring here and then they started

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.119 
spring here and then they started
blocking<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.509> off<00:05:13.599> with<00:05:13.839> these<00:05:13.990> trees<00:05:14.770> and

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
blocking it off with these trees and

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.980 
blocking it off with these trees and
eventually<00:05:15.849> became<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.210> meet-and-greet<00:05:16.569> area

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
eventually became a meet-and-greet area

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.079 
eventually became a meet-and-greet area
along<00:05:17.289> after<00:05:17.650> all<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:17.949> that<00:05:17.979> but<00:05:18.789> I<00:05:18.849> thought<00:05:18.999> it
