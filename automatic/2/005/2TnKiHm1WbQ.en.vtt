00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 everyone is just going to be ahead 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 show well in the preparation 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.440
 everyone has the same chance 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.120
 but just how hungry you are and how 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.129
 like you want it of course one or me 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 shows on the liter liter field eventually 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.890
 will stand and you must of course fit that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.719
 are natural 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.329
 so do everything to stay fit and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.039
 flora you are the farmer 's hunger 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 figures my training camp in austria 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.460
 the monster 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.689
 Diego Riedewald must wake you up 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 understand what you mean 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.680
 yes i understand what i mean i am now 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 no youth player anymore so now it has to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
 happen yes i'm behind now 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.570
 grown up so I have to play too 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 show on the game 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 the same goes for can eat the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.460
 right back is working on a 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.409
 impressive preparation and breathing in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.210
 the neck of ricardo van rhijn 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 according to some, he is already there 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.689
 beyond anyway it becomes one 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 interesting fight I think so very 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.950
 a lot of experience and has been around for a while and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.619
 I actually just came to watch so I 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.079
 think he actually stand 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.250
 this moment also that there are three things 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.170
 for eating since a few months 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 quite a few changes he played the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.079
 last matches of the previous 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.130
 season and is therefore increasing the pressure 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.210
 from Rhine 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'm definitely looking for an owner 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.009
 places I think this can continue both 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.350
 it got bigger last year on the me 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.850
 actually two competitors and this year 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.039
 only one so yes the chances are such a big one 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 so in the selection of things 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.920
 more and more places and interesting 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.420
 fight going on 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.860
 if you are very over with the fresh start 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.269
 and then it is really about who the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.220
 is best and who has the vest and who 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.560
 it your hungry sister and that is nice 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.260
 in itself not that you think I'm going 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.000
 today at 50% because that and that goes 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.440
 anyway play that is not there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.459
 it's a fun job that might 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.290
 also a bit different 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.910
 Compared to last year, last year you 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.620
 number exactly that your fish from that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.910
 is going to play anyway so why should I 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.319
 maybe i still train people 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.360
 that did have us hard too 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.769
 train but this year is 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360
 state count again jump the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.269
 last year also competition for me 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.670
 think this year the competition really 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.959
 a very very large Spanish top club there 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.590
 I think so with every top team 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 competition
