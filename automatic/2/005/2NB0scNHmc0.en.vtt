00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.670
 transformable toys in that case 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.600
 toys transforming tell us what is 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.130
 this 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.050
 well then the transformable tastes 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.310
 well basically what we could 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.500
 talk is about transformers that is the 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.540
 best- known brand and is a brand of 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.970
 toys that appeared in the year 1984 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.880
 as a quality this year it takes 30 years 30 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.800
 añitos y madre mía how many and well then 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.329
 from small not as soon as we 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.030
 we love it and we have followed 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.560
 for many years and good at the end you 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.430
 you get enough people you make a 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.470
 association 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.899
 you start to put and you run out of type 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.479
 political a curiosity from what years 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.990
 have you been collecting 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.999
 approximately from 9 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.369
 years and how many do you have if you can say 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.090
 for several hundred several hundred 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.200
 my mother 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.869
 Tell us a little about what you do in this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 association in a cat and like as os 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.020
 you agree that you have because I know what 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.819
 you do everything a little new 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 exhibitions you have congresses account 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.079
 good mind then nothing started we started 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.369
 as a group of friends that simply 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.770
 we met through the internet 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.079
 because well this is a hobby 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.929
 quite minority in Spain is not very 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.810
 common no no because I believe mostly 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.819
 because they were very expensive when they came out and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.709
 people were not there or they did not cheer up 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.770
 no no no there were much more options 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.420
 cheap and affordable if not plan and 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.789
 nothing because we started to know each other 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 through the internet and well then one day 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.349
 it started to be good because 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.409
 comment a little our hobby and here and 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.459
 of that then we begin to expose 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.259
 particularly we are founded once a 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.719
 year mostly doing what he called the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.519
 annual and good days and then already 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.200
 when we saw a few years 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.150
 which was better and to associate 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 because he could request premises from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 embargo 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.170
 when the association has already grown 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 that groups them all and in the house is 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.790
 a little more wrapped to carry 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.769
 out our hobby we are a little bit 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.019
 more attracted because I have brought here a 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.390
 poquillo and more than anything to be a 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.440
 little representative of the 30 years is 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.930
 more or less than what the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.700
 exhibition that we are going to make the end of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.159
 week on 9 on March 10 is because the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.200
 It arrives next week and this lounge 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.390
 comic and manga that every year 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.739
 Well, at the trade show, it brings together 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.810
 thousands of people we can say that 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.670
 thousands of fans go through there 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.500
 year as it is being said miguel is the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.910
 day 9 and 10 next week we will have 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.950
 also tickets 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.989
 we will have invitations so that those who 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.519
 they are watching us at home 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.379
 get them and this is part of what 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.470
 let's also be able to help this 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.940
 It's part of my personal collection because 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.650
 we have a collection of the association and 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.239
 good bring it next Sunday 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.569
 there has not yet been time to bring it 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.950
 but it can be what is given a little 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.150
 of 30 years 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 let's make it look good 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.590
 we could start with these two that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.560
 would be the boss of the good 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.860
 bad ideas of the original toys 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.330
 of the year 84 these are my mother 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.250
 you can tell they 're a little bit old 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.260
 good indeed but but good 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 they are pretty well aware that then already 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.660
 after that we can pass the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.090
 next epoch 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.040
 for example this toy here that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.480
 they sought to be transformed into 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.960
 animals that are particularly 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.760
 transforms into a rabbit and also to 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.760
 that looks good how they transform 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.390
 today the children I imagine will be 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.070
 fascinated with this type of toy and I 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.130
 I think it's a toy that's pretty 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.410
 attractive for children because for a 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.810
 part the title you say gives you a little 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.870
 two for one because you have a robot and 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.210
 aside then well you have another toy 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.000
 with the originals, well, they were good 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.340
 above all vehicles 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.250
 they have evolved they have changed 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.940
 very much over the years and good 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.940
 here we have the bunny 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.480
 because to transform this the first 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.480
 one hour later 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:37.330
 and nothing then later after passing the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:43.390
 age of the animals and say that of the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:46.510
 year roughly 96 96 97 and then already 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.140
 going into the 2000s we have for 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.410
 example this is important to form a 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.410
 planet 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.810
 on a mother planet of mine and well there 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:06.120
 come on what 's the series bounced pretty 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.120
 he was very successful in three movies 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.010
 get a lot more up and up 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.800
 actually the idea was originally 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.870
 the year 84 then take out the series of 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.430
 toys and how to advertise the best that 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.260
 they make a cartoon series already 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.730
 from taking out comics and then already on 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.950
 evolved and has reached the 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.170
 movies and everything is all publicity 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.210
 for the man in the toys but 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.620
 good after all, well, you have other 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.330
 options you can for big and for 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.240
 small and I think we like this 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.009
 absolutely everyone 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.419
 a track for those who want to 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.889
 better be part of your association 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.500
 or ask how I get these 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.430
 figures 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
