00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
 in this lesson we'll see what you can 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.290
 do with an airbrush that is how 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.429
 using different methods you can 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.109
 significantly airbrush to leave 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.130
 various plines and surfaces as well 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.080
 how can different 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.199
 we have 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.779
 available materials to create 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.679
 interesting effects 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.210
 mean from the distance the airbrushes to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.850
 surface depends 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 what point will he leave on 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.390
 the surface is there and depends on it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.100
 directly 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.100
 what they can do we look 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.440
 that is, it is clear that when we have Aurora 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.160
 far he leaves a big point 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 airbrush close we leave it very 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.949
 close 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.490
 even less . 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.100
 web 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.560
 Now 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.710
 if we move the airbrush fast 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.330
 even when very large is turned on 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.330
 streams it will leave a thin line 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.009
 in some way 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.670
 Now 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.670
 If we 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.200
 what we know is well let's say 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.179
 let's play with the same size points 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 points then we can achieve interesting 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.119
 effects for example using sizes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.310
 different sizes of points we can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.539
 create a background for some 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.689
 natural pattern for example something like 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.689
 grassy meadows 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.880
 glade which is obtained in the background 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.950
 always let us in the foreground 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.310
 a flower and say to the back 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.470
 background 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.570
 if we put the camera on the front 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 our background plan is blurring here we are 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.950
 Now create some kind of life 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.000
 it's like 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.030
 that is, it is very easy to create 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.510
 interesting background for some 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.510
 pictures
