with yeah there's a hesitation that's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.650 
with yeah there's a hesitation that's
why<00:02:49.099> even<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.280> playing<00:02:50.459> live<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.120> tend<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.480> have

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
why even I playing live I tend to have

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.750 
why even I playing live I tend to have
mental<00:02:52.170> blocks<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.680> lot<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> thing<00:02:53.250> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
mental blocks a lot of the thing just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.979 
mental blocks a lot of the thing just
completely<00:02:54.090> blank<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.599> what<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.870> I'm

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
completely blank and what is I'm

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.390 
completely blank and what is I'm
supposed<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.470> seems<00:02:55.620> or<00:02:55.829> I'm<00:02:56.190> very

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
supposed to be it seems or I'm very

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.039 
supposed to be it seems or I'm very
familiar<00:02:56.519> with<00:02:56.879> those<00:02:57.420> particular<00:02:57.720> three

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
familiar with those particular three

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.589 
familiar with those particular three
chords<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.760> neck<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.180> actually<00:03:00.360> would

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
chords on the neck I actually would

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.800 
chords on the neck I actually would
forget<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.140> which<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.500> far<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.980> minor<00:03:02.250> do<00:03:02.549> you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
forget or which is far as a minor do you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.870 
forget or which is far as a minor do you
know<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.280> find<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.340> sometimes<00:03:05.700> I'm<00:03:05.850> doing

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
know I find that sometimes I'm doing

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.729 
know I find that sometimes I'm doing
sort<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.810> things<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:09.440> mnemonics<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.650> know

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
sort of things like mnemonics you know

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.599 
sort of things like mnemonics you know
you<00:03:10.859> try<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> make<00:03:11.190> an<00:03:11.310> award

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.670 

okay<00:03:17.609> let's<00:03:17.819> do<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.410> make<00:03:19.410> sure<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.560> figured

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
okay let's do this make sure you figured

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.890 
okay let's do this make sure you figured
in<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.920> progression<00:03:20.190> all<00:03:20.549> right<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.840> not

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
in the progression all right so it's not

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.780 
in the progression all right so it's not
finding<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.769> shapes<00:03:23.040> into<00:03:23.340> remembering<00:03:23.639> one

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
finding the shapes into remembering one

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.759 
finding the shapes into remembering one
couple<00:03:24.000> next<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.569> lot<00:03:25.049> of<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.200> time<00:03:25.380> yet

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
couple next a lot of the time yet

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.920 
couple next a lot of the time yet
alright<00:03:26.069> let's<00:03:26.250> do<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.670> I'll<00:03:27.209> call<00:03:27.540> off<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
alright let's do this I'll call off the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.259 
alright let's do this I'll call off the
chords<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.459> play<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.450> play<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
chords and you play that you play the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.339 
chords and you play that you play the
inversion<00:03:33.290> exactly<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.410> time<00:03:34.880> okay<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.170> I'm

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
inversion exactly in time okay so I'm

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.300 
inversion exactly in time okay so I'm
gonna<00:03:37.769> call<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.130> chords<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:41.040> you

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
gonna call it the chords and then you

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.659 
gonna call it the chords and then you
know<00:03:41.400> once<00:03:41.639> an<00:03:41.790> e<00:03:41.910> star<00:03:42.180> okay<00:03:42.419> so<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.019> minor

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
know once an e star okay so it's a minor

00:03:43.669 --> 00:04:04.440 
know once an e star okay so it's a minor
D<00:03:44.669> minor<00:03:44.700> E<00:03:45.150> minor

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:30.580 

okay<00:04:26.770> said<00:04:27.770> another<00:04:27.860> court<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.370> said<00:04:28.520> G<00:04:29.169> okay<00:04:30.169> G

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
D minor that version we've been better

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.300 
D minor that version we've been better
used<00:04:57.139> let's<00:04:57.500> try<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.710> again<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.039> use<00:04:58.130> this

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
used let's try it again and use this

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.129 
used let's try it again and use this
inversion<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.120> open<00:04:59.389> position<00:04:59.900> setup

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
inversion with the open position setup

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:25.380 
inversion with the open position setup
the<00:05:00.229> open<00:05:00.470> G<00:05:00.620> chord<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:01.099> mean<00:05:01.729> yes

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.110 

I<00:05:28.360> think<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:31.340> did<00:05:31.520> put<00:05:31.700> just<00:05:31.850> put<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.000> little

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
I think you did put just put a little

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.920 
I think you did put just put a little
pressure<00:05:32.270> on<00:05:32.420> yourself<00:05:33.160> you<00:05:34.160> know<00:05:34.190> if<00:05:34.580> you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
pressure on yourself you know if you

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.010 
pressure on yourself you know if you
turn<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.020> metronome<00:05:36.380> on<00:05:36.530> 260<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:38.120> do<00:05:38.810> one

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
turn the metronome on 260 and do one

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.480 
turn the metronome on 260 and do one
inversion<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.560> second<00:05:42.160> okay

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
inversion a second okay

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.230 
inversion a second okay
without<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:44.510> pressure<00:05:44.750> there's<00:05:46.120> there's<00:05:47.120> no

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
without that pressure there's there's no

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.660 
without that pressure there's there's no
reason<00:05:47.510> for<00:05:47.540> you<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.720> hurry<00:05:47.900> up<00:05:48.140> mm-hmm<00:05:49.100> give

you need but you know obviously the real

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.830 
you need but you know obviously the real
physical<00:05:55.640> context<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:56.420> don't<00:05:56.570> have<00:05:56.690> that

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
physical context you don't have that

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.110 
physical context you don't have that
luxury<00:05:56.990> yeah<00:05:57.890> you<00:05:58.190> you<00:05:58.400> have<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.730> do<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:58.970> in

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
luxury yeah you you have to do it in

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.750 
luxury yeah you you have to do it in
time
