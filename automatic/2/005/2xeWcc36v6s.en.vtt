hi<00:00:06.609> in<00:00:06.879> this<00:00:07.149> video<00:00:07.359> we<00:00:07.750> are<00:00:07.870> going<00:00:08.080> to<00:00:08.320> discuss

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:08.679 
hi in this video we are going to discuss

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.740 
hi in this video we are going to discuss
about<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:09.490> types<00:00:09.760> of<00:00:10.000> leaves<00:00:10.269> there<00:00:10.599> are

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
about the types of leaves there are

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.099 
about the types of leaves there are
various<00:00:11.170> types<00:00:11.379> of<00:00:11.650> leaves<00:00:11.950> on<00:00:12.219> the<00:00:13.080> basis<00:00:14.080> of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:14.109 
various types of leaves on the basis of

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.800 
various types of leaves on the basis of
their<00:00:14.439> structure<00:00:15.039> the<00:00:16.029> mode<00:00:16.240> in<00:00:16.420> which<00:00:16.600> they

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
their structure the mode in which they

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.560 
their structure the mode in which they
are<00:00:16.930> present<00:00:17.380> on<00:00:17.529> the<00:00:17.680> stem<00:00:17.980> etc<00:00:18.970> so<00:00:19.269> in<00:00:19.390> this

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
are present on the stem etc so in this

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.140 
are present on the stem etc so in this
video<00:00:19.900> we<00:00:20.050> will<00:00:20.170> discuss<00:00:20.560> all<00:00:21.160> those<00:00:21.640> types<00:00:21.939> of

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
video we will discuss all those types of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.399 
video we will discuss all those types of
leaves<00:00:22.900> present<00:00:23.410> in<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.740> variety<00:00:24.249> of<00:00:24.279> plants<00:00:25.409> so

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:26.409 
leaves present in a variety of plants so

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.069 
leaves present in a variety of plants so
let<00:00:26.710> us<00:00:26.740> start<00:00:27.640> with<00:00:27.989> the<00:00:29.159> types<00:00:30.159> of<00:00:30.429> leaves

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
let us start with the types of leaves

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.650 
let us start with the types of leaves
first<00:00:32.079> of<00:00:32.230> all<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.710> leaf<00:00:33.310> we<00:00:33.579> said<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:34.000> be<00:00:34.149> simple

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
first of all a leaf we said to be simple

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.720 
first of all a leaf we said to be simple
when<00:00:35.649> its<00:00:36.250> lamina<00:00:36.970> is<00:00:37.390> entire<00:00:38.350> all<00:00:38.650> insist<00:00:39.430> a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
when its lamina is entire all insist a

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.860 
when its lamina is entire all insist a
leaf<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.960> said<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.380> be<00:00:42.240> simple<00:00:45.540> first<00:00:46.540> of<00:00:46.720> all

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
leaf is said to be simple first of all

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.930 
leaf is said to be simple first of all
we<00:00:47.080> will<00:00:47.200> discuss<00:00:47.620> about<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:48.070> simple<00:00:48.490> type<00:00:48.670> of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
we will discuss about the simple type of

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.480 
we will discuss about the simple type of
leaf<00:00:49.380> in<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.740> simple<00:00:51.160> type<00:00:51.340> of<00:00:51.400> leaf<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
leaf in the simple type of leaf the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.600 
leaf in the simple type of leaf the
lamina<00:00:54.490> of<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.570> leaf<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:56.020> entire<00:00:56.680> or<00:00:57.040> insist

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
lamina of the leaf is entire or insist

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:06.219 
lamina of the leaf is entire or insist
suppose<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:59.050> a<00:00:59.260> leaf

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.770 

this<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.130> leave<00:01:07.340> here<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.240> leaf<00:01:08.509> we

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
this is the leave here in this leaf we

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.880 
this is the leave here in this leaf we
can<00:01:08.960> see<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.689> lamina<00:01:11.689> of<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.439> leaf<00:01:12.619> is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
can see that the lamina of the leaf is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.149 
can see that the lamina of the leaf is
entire<00:01:13.430> or<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:14.000> may<00:01:14.210> be<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.659> cyst<00:01:15.259> also<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.890> this

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
entire or it may be in cyst also in this

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.460 
entire or it may be in cyst also in this
form

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.100 

these<00:01:25.340> are<00:01:25.550> two<00:01:25.730> types<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.240> leaves<00:01:26.480> here<00:01:26.930> we

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
these are two types of leaves here we

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.610 
these are two types of leaves here we
can<00:01:27.260> see<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.500> in<00:01:27.830> one<00:01:27.860> which<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.470> lemon<00:01:30.470> is

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
can see that in one which the lemon is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.430 
can see that in one which the lemon is
Gentile<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.550> in<00:01:32.000> one<00:01:32.270> win<00:01:32.570> which<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.140> lemon

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
Gentile and in one win which the lemon

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.330 
Gentile and in one win which the lemon
is<00:01:33.650> insist<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.900> incisions<00:01:36.530> do<00:01:36.800> not<00:01:37.010> reach

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is insist but the incisions do not reach

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.260 
is insist but the incisions do not reach
up<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.330> middle<00:01:38.870> this<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.070> main<00:01:40.910> wing

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
up to the middle this is the main wing

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020 
up to the middle this is the main wing
or<00:01:41.960> this<00:01:42.260> is<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.530> midrib<00:01:42.980> of<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.340> leaf<00:01:43.520> here

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
or this is the midrib of the leaf here

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.940 
or this is the midrib of the leaf here
also<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:44.630> see<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.530> midrib

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
also we can see that this is the midrib

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.780 
also we can see that this is the midrib
or<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.730> Midway<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:48.050> these<00:01:48.410> incisions<00:01:49.010> should

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
or the Midway so these incisions should

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.050 
or the Midway so these incisions should
not<00:01:50.120> reach<00:01:50.570> up<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.650> midrib<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.730> case

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
not reach up to the midrib in that case

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.470 
not reach up to the midrib in that case
the<00:01:53.300> leaf<00:01:53.480> is<00:01:53.720> called<00:01:54.050> as<00:01:54.260> simple<00:01:55.220> leaf<00:01:55.400> so<00:01:56.120> for

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
the leaf is called as simple leaf so for

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.680 
the leaf is called as simple leaf so for
the<00:01:56.630> simple<00:01:56.840> leaf<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.710> lamina<00:01:58.070> should<00:01:58.460> be

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the simple leaf the lamina should be

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.770 
the simple leaf the lamina should be
entire<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.110> if<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.460> is<00:02:01.610> insist<00:02:02.150> then<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
entire and if it is insist then the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.020 
entire and if it is insist then the
incisions<00:02:03.380> should<00:02:03.860> not<00:02:04.100> reach<00:02:04.850> up<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
incisions should not reach up to the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.980 
incisions should not reach up to the
Madrid<00:02:09.100> secondly<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.670> leaf<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.480> compound

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
Madrid secondly the leaf is of compound

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.620 
Madrid secondly the leaf is of compound
type<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.070> found<00:02:13.370> leaf<00:02:13.610> what<00:02:14.180> happens

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
type in the found leaf what happens

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.540 
type in the found leaf what happens
these<00:02:15.320> incisions<00:02:16.120> reach<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.600> midrib

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
these incisions reach up to the midrib

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.720 
these incisions reach up to the midrib
these<00:02:22.550> incisions<00:02:23.150> reach<00:02:23.960> up<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> midriff

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
these incisions reach up to the midriff

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.170 
these incisions reach up to the midriff
and<00:02:26.620> dividing<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.010> leaf<00:02:28.250> into<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.730> number<00:02:29.150> of

and dividing the leaf into a number of

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.600 
and dividing the leaf into a number of
leaflets<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.680> thing<00:02:30.920> what<00:02:31.190> happens

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
leaflets in this thing what happens

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.650 
leaflets in this thing what happens
these<00:02:32.420> incisions<00:02:33.220> will<00:02:34.220> reach<00:02:34.550> up<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
these incisions will reach up to the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the leaf get separate that is these

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.670 
the leaf get separate that is these
incisions

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
incisions

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.089

so this is all about so this is all

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.379 
so this is all about so this is all
about<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:43.320> types<00:06:43.590> of<00:06:43.830> leaves<00:06:44.130> in<00:06:44.880> which<00:06:45.150> we

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
about the types of leaves in which we

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.480 
about the types of leaves in which we
have<00:06:45.600> discussed<00:06:46.080> about<00:06:46.430> the<00:06:48.740> simple<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:50.010> the

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
have discussed about the simple and the

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.850 
have discussed about the simple and the
compound<00:06:51.150> types<00:06:51.419> of<00:06:51.660> leaves<00:06:51.900> and<00:06:52.169> what<00:06:52.680> are

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
compound types of leaves and what are

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.370 
compound types of leaves and what are
the<00:06:53.010> differences<00:06:53.520> between<00:06:53.580> these<00:06:54.419> two<00:06:54.480> in<00:06:55.200> our

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
the differences between these two in our

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.830 
the differences between these two in our
next<00:06:55.770> video<00:06:55.919> we<00:06:56.280> will<00:06:56.310> discuss<00:06:56.820> about<00:06:57.000> fill

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840
