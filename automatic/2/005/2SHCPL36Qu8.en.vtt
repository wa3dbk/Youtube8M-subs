00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.400 
doesn't usually wear glasses in every
episode<00:05:15.450> but<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:15.750> think<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.050> kind<00:05:16.320> of

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
episode but I think this kind of

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.500 
episode but I think this kind of
completes<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.610> look

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.200
