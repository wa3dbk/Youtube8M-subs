00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.560

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.660
 always appears new thing is this 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.730
 in today 's river is thus the best 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 game premieres part 12 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.110
 Let's count on several references 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.330
 movie references from other games and 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.399
 It's okay, I hope you enjoy it. 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.219
 let's go to them 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.379
 the first easter egg of today's video is 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.319
 a reference to a hollywood movie and 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.929
 of passing a great movie is as follows 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.519
 I died and was born in this hospital that 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.769
 It is a place that is quite natural. 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.140
 Nasser when I die here and I paid 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.809
 attention across the street and had 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.269
 a poster that advertised a movie and my 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.989
 At the time I hit the eye, it came in 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.139
 my head 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 type danse if you have a movie that 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:05.620
 produced this eternity this scene there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.140
 said dante that it is hot rhythm or dance 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.730
 with me here in Brazil and dude I'm going 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.190
 leave you with a piece of the movie that 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.840
 perform this feat there and then come back 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.460
 To talk some more things that go 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.460
 prove it's a reference to the film 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.670
 Rafael was already dengue 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.620
 it rains here already 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.840
 just to confirm that it is rather a 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.690
 he refers to the film he a poster is 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.970
 with musical and the film is being released 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.610
 on August 14 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.690
 the original film was released on the 21st 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.520
 August 1987 a year I was born 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.640
 so it does not refer to the movie 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.950
 yes and maybe because the actor 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.410
 main feature of the movie patrik that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.310
 his name recently died of 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.530
 cancer 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.230
 then perhaps it was a tribute to the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.240
 rockstar to the very cool guy and the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.310
 movie download is the description for 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.340
 who cared 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.390
 now a reference to brazil and gta5 is 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.370
 the next I had seen this 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.510
 reference in the David channel where he 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.700
 find the establishment was 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.260
 I write the colors of Brazil 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.720
 something that looks like a drawing is going to be 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.120
 the flag very similar and sent me 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.000
 by facebook at the airport had a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.740
 The plane that had the country name I 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.590
 I came to take a look and it really is and you 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.540
 can see by the name caipira camping as 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.739
 to deny is a Brazilian company so 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.480
 inside gta 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.300
 Can you look at the colors of the airplane? 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.420
 here the color- like good of the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.160
 Flag of Brazil and it's very cool. 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.670
 You may have been out of the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.310
 airport also the hick I think 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.410
 is where they meet the staff very 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.420
 That's a good reference. 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.040
 never forget that you watched the video until 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.630
 now you know she does not forget 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.480
 only it was going to be as soon as she was over 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.570
 discrete than in gta 4 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.790
 this is the easter egg minecraft face 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.680
 and if his horse was very nice 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.140
 because his car was the first to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.900
 find old and the coolest was that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340
 heard daines make a video of cister eg 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.080
 thing it is very difficult for you to see a 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.019
 gringo make a video after the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.310
 I did find it very cool and 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.890
 I just brought it to you here too. 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.190
 note that there is the drawing of the character in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.860
 up there and if you 're not inside the store 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.470
 has a poster and with this drawing a 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.130
 and making a clear 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.520
 reference to the minecraft game by far 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.020
 cool 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.430
 I always add some things 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.650
 in the video that are not 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.210
 necessarily easter eggs things 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.220
 cool, what happened in the game? 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.500
 I ended up recording and I bring it for you to see. 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.210
 Also understood is this okay 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.650
 sending me past the travel house 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.850
 he was simply drunk i do not know 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.530
 if he can get crazier than 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.480
 it's because he's a psychopath all over 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.580
 world knows this and he was playing 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.430
 he earns nothing guy he played grenades 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.620
 he could and he would give back and 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.690
 It was everybody shouting man I found 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.209
 very funny and I ended up recording not 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.000
 I know if you have seen this but it is 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.160
 pretty fuck you see the clove almost killing 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.750
 It is just something himself a friend 's house 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.340
 the other interesting thing happened 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.780
 with me was in online mode working 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.180
 with an alloy I think that's how it was pronounced 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.620
 their name is no excuse there and we 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.080
 I was playing online to make some 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.690
 Stuff there and what happened face of 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.480
 Suddenly we disappeared went to limbo 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.660
 of the game and inside the car then my 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.000
 that weird old and stayed up bad 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.580
 time then the car was not going forward 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.990
 doing nothing does not look back and only 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.450
 stopped the joke when I solved it 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.640
 get out of the car and I fall out flying limbo 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.830
 it's a joke, kidding 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.410
 this location there you can find 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.180
 a reference to captain america and is the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.920
 following a lot of people saying that squeaked 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.630
 it is not that the reference to the flag of the 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.760
 how are you going to talk about this 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.300
 video that is a non captain reference 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.980
 America 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.380
 but you take into account this 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.230
 where they are as if they were a 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.630
 shield the colors and in the middle of the source has 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.880
 an eagle if you search schilder is 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.590
 marvel you will see the water drawing 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.810
 then everything leads one to believe that it is a 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.720
 captain 's marvel sim reference 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.930
 america then it's my opinion and I think 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.940
 That's really a lot of coincidence. 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.770
 is a reference in my opinion to the 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.060
 captain America 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.370
