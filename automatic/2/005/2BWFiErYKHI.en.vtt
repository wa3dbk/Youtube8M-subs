 I've heard a big explosion and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.680
 I think I know who the culprits are 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.140
 They are pretty drunk bikers 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.090
 They arrived 10 minutes ago asking me for a 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
 bazooka I refused to give it to him but I 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.920
 they threatened so I had to give it to them 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.130
 it's okay do not worry you can tell me 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.970
 where the explosion has come from, of course 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.600

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.390

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.210
 explosion and I have worried I come to 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.400
 a weapon then right now the agent 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.340
 I started you and I was going to see where 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.980
 the explosion has come in that case I'm going 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.720
 with you I am curious to know 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.720
 what has been that explosion 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.960
 you have to leave here the gases that 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 produces the project g7 are very harmful 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.150
 you have dear your lives 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.819
 are in danger 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 maybe he's right, we have to evacuate 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.290
 the village is better to prevent 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.860
 Roberto listened to what happened the week 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.990
 last yes I heard that they evacuated a village 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.690
 whole and that three people were 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.700
 hospitalized for poisoning one is 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.310
 out of danger but the other two 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.770
 they are serious apparently that town is 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.560
 now completely empty as 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.990
 is severely contaminated if I have 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.910
 heard that 44 people have been 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.040
 found dead in strangers 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.150
 circumstances I hope that that 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.150
 pollution does not expand 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.280
 you know where my husband is 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.440
 yes but you can not see him right now 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.190
 in poor condition and we will not know if it can 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.190
 catch 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.920
 because you have people locked tem 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.020
 in day koslov inside this jail 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.440
 because we do not know if they can be 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.570
 Contagious you have a high fever and 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.560
 can go I do not know how but it has 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.560
 recovered very fast 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.870
 I will go to drink something 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.990
 but what the hell is this 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.270
 is one of the victims of the explosion 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.430
 of the convoy they have sent me to tell you 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.620
 bring for you to examine it is they say that 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.940
 has quite strange things and the 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.850
 truth is that it has broken down 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.830
 much faster than normal and to 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:51.160
 look her in the eyes gives me the feeling of 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.160
 that is alive is fine I will examine it 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.740
 but before checking one thing 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.410
 but what the hell where is the body 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.150
 do not 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.009
 francis until examined the body already 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.979
