 I want to talk about my own experience 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.769

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:53.960
 Oh my mother is a mother who is not good at cooking very much and if you cook it 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.940
 The color seems to be black 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.449
 And Well there is also such but it was a mother Tteyuu fatherless families that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.950
 That mother was out in work every day 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.080
 so 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 One day me I bought the shrimp treatment height of the side dish of that super 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:18.429
 Because the shrimp chili was so delicious for me 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.270
 This from along the mother When told that say this Ebichiri I really delicious to mother 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:25.240
 every day 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.329
 I bought that same shrimp chili, so honestly I bought it everyday in my mind 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.229
 Even if I did not have to come to me, I also felt that I was coming up with a jacker 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.080
 But 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.610
 Well mother Ebichiri Why narrow my child went and delicious Oh 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:42.140
 My mother bought me every day 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.470
 I heard that you had fallen at that workplace 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.910
 If you rush to that hospital 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 I have been sentenced to the terminal cancer 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:02:01.340
 In though is Tan continued for about six months that illness 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:05.460
 Well, my mother has gone to heaven , so it 's even after my mother's death 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.240
 After all the shrimp chili which I bought for me eats so much 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.950
 Want it to come do we're eaten in but I also got a say Rutte 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 There is a supermarket close to the house in about 1 minute from the house. 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:24.750
 So when my mother finishes her work , she goes shopping at the supermarket and comes home. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.450
 It was a flow, so if you go to the supermarket there , I think it 's the usual place to buy 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.090
 I went 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 Then there's that shrimp chili there, not the shrimp chiri I always eat 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.910
 I wonder if has become a discontinued Well since being eaten Ebichiri there was no side-by-side 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:44.180
 I thought so and I went home with that sad feeling 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.719
 From there, it will be about 3 days until I arrange my mother's relics 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.290
 I came out a lot of the receipt from the bag 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.950
 I saw the receipt ah 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.879
 Shrimp Chile say 398 yen 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.640
 There were tens of thousands of receipts with only one item written 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:06.520
 If you look carefully at the receipt 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.610
 It's not about a minute from the house, but it's about 20 minutes from there. 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.360
 I wrote the name of another super distant store 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.030
 The point is that 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:22.790
 That Mawazawaza the Ebichiri that I said Datte love 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 I passed through the nearest supermarket and bought me every day for 20 minutes every day 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.830
 That say 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:33.050
 Then the shrimp treatment mother bought it until the day before it falls for the first time noticing it 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.410
 Just give me 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:41.300
 Though there was a feeling of great gratitude 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.200
 My mother has already gone to heaven when I want to convey that feeling of thanks 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.380
 Because it was a situation 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.730
 The people that I am heard by all means to have heard this also 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.110
 That while mother and father are fine 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.100
 And I thought that I think we can I can say a few words to say thank you 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.930
 I was allowed to speak this kind of experience 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.930
 Thank you 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.100
 Especially if you live far away 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.450
 Because it may not meet bedding 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.459
 And 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.600
 It was too hard for me to buy such a side dish every day, but it was a thin but missing companion book 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.150
 Are you 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.009
