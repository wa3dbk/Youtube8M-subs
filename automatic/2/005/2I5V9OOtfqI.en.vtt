00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hello everyone, Natalia Muffia 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.450
 and today's video is exactly that 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.450
 pros and cons summer you say sort of 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.100
 don't we really know pros and cons 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.710
 we all know we just have this now 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.869
 I'm becoming quite popular 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.020
 seen many bloggers and here it is 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.250
 cheap take off added something yours so 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.309
 We start of course 1 plus and this is this 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.440
 what is the warmest time of the year when 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.989
 finally you can enjoy the warm 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 the sun warm emphasized what we are 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.569
 not enough in the winter 2 + does this this that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.409
 only this time of year is really 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:51.199
 fresh fruits vegetables and berries can 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.239
 go to the forest for berries closely it is not 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.269
 we have enough in the winter because in the winter everything 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.420
 more than some kind of natural let's say 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.460
 smeared with various additives 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.610
 it is in summer everything is fresh and very tasty 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 the following plus I think this is what 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.780
 you can finally swim in the river 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.680
 lake with friends from a big company 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 have fun and have a good time 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.120
 next plus years in what we wear 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.720
 minimum clothes can be the devil T-shirts 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.000
 various tops and favorite sandals name 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.830
 freeze walking sunbathing and it's great 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.950
 in fact because in the winter we 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.080
 constantly turning like philip oh I'm 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.720
 I do not know here are a few steps 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.410
 and in the summer we rest all those heavy 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.460
 clothes also for me just for me 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.140
 plus summer is that you can spend 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.240
 evenings on our favorite balcony 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.909
 because the evenings are pretty warm and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.510
 pleasant and when u don't stand like a wall and 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.010
 we love on 1 valera to go to the balcony and 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.640
 read scary stories i mean it all 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.070
 happens as if in the open air and 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.130
 warm and good and scary stories 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 the evening goes on hurray well and probably 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.090
 last years pulse i'm on not to 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.250
 especially tighten our videos 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.230
 exactly what you can eat ice cream 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.240
 several times a day and you don't even 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.890
 will it be somehow embarrassing or ashamed 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.980
 Well, if the level of dieting 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.980
 because for example the cold season 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.230
 ice cream they are he generally a summer when 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.780
 Of course, I want to sharpen the strong 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 I like some kind of fruit ice 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.650
 you all those mass fights 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.630
 intense stuff on sundae ice cream 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 somehow indifferent through working people 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.970
 this is my topic this i like very much and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.330
 Now let's talk about the cons of years 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.900
 summer cons less by itself than 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.300
 advantages but still I found them and so 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.970
 Iâ€™ll tell you about them now 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.840
 that one of the most powerful such say 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.580
 cons of this time galya something very 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.860
 a lot of midges and mosquitoes 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.890
 saying exactly showed which goes with us 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.260
 Now it is now a lot of midges 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.900
 legs are not much more disgusting than mosquitoes 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.650
 mosquito and they kind of sit down not bite you 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.750
 well, more precisely 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.470
 and go fly there to discuss 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.049
 scratched but legs all arranged so 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 you just bite and she eats a piece 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.260
 your body your meat and your skin and 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.230
 I think you know about it that I am a Turk oz in 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.870
 general legs is just awesome 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.600
 minus summer so you need to buy a sekis 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.049
 about and lotions and creams and gels something like that 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.959
 pray and hope that you may not 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.880
 Will stick of course also very large 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.040
 minus summer is that it is very short 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.890
 all the guys here it just started 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.010
 forget and kick out and fall it surely 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.750
 the sad and still found at two years minus 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.440
 Of course you agree with me that 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.700
 really minus and it's heat 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.489
 it is impossible to be in such heat 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.040
 buses stand in traffic jams this is very 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.170
 creepy 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.170
 not catch heat stroke will hurt 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.170
 head also dimples and just buy 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.870
 fans what I think sit cars 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.299
 then it will be easier for all these 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.980
 transferred to although knowing myself I'm here 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.650
 can't ride this heat in 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.539
 buses in the spring is terribly bad and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.829
 the last minus is also related to the heat 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.690
 probably you all take a shower 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.259
 several times a day when it is very hot 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.750
 on the street and even the fact is that even though you 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.539
 take it all the time but anyway 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.789
 still worth going out 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.250
 Again sweat sweat and you feel 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.539
 yourself some kind of you nightly on 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.169
 really with a fork 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.620
 very smelly and this is all my video 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.000
 coming to the end 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.500

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.300
