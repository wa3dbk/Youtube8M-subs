00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
you know that's something that people

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.950 
you know that's something that people
have<00:00:40.489> been<00:00:40.610> wanting<00:00:40.879> for<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> long<00:00:41.090> time<00:00:41.510> and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
have been wanting for a long time and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.720 
have been wanting for a long time and
it's<00:00:42.140> definitely<00:00:42.410> something<00:00:42.710> that's<00:00:42.890> like<00:00:43.640> a

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
it's definitely something that's like a

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.670 
it's definitely something that's like a
glaring<00:00:44.120> omission<00:00:44.270> from<00:00:44.600> series<00:00:45.230> abilities

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
so hopefully this really does pan out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.760 
so hopefully this really does pan out
because<00:00:47.870> it'd<00:00:47.989> be<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.110> great<00:00:48.320> addition<00:00:48.590> to

to<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.280> ipad<00:00:58.820> which<00:00:59.180> would<00:00:59.809> be<00:00:59.960> excellent<00:01:00.350> I'm

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
to the ipad which would be excellent I'm

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.520 
to the ipad which would be excellent I'm
not<00:01:00.800> really<00:01:01.160> sure<00:01:01.280> why<00:01:01.960> Apple<00:01:02.960> just<00:01:03.140> decided

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
not really sure why Apple just decided

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.920 
not really sure why Apple just decided
to<00:01:03.680> stick<00:01:03.890> with<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.190> dictation<00:01:04.879> form<00:01:05.509> of<00:01:05.660> Siri

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
to stick with the dictation form of Siri

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.800 
to stick with the dictation form of Siri
for<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.649> new<00:01:06.830> iPad<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.490> not<00:01:07.670> full<00:01:08.090> Siri<00:01:08.420> so

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
for the new iPad and not full Siri so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.480 
for the new iPad and not full Siri so
that<00:01:08.959> would<00:01:09.080> also<00:01:09.229> be<00:01:09.349> very<00:01:09.560> cool<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.099> then<00:01:10.369> of

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
that would also be very cool and then of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.309 
that would also be very cool and then of
course<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.819> third<00:01:11.060> rumored<00:01:11.420> feature<00:01:11.630> for<00:01:11.929> iOS

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
course the third rumored feature for iOS

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.389 
course the third rumored feature for iOS
6<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:13.360> Apple's<00:01:14.360> own<00:01:14.690> internally<00:01:15.619> build<00:01:15.860> 3d

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
map service on iOS phones which probably

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.520 
map service on iOS phones which probably
won't<00:01:22.009> change<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:23.090> much<00:01:23.149> in<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.690> way<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.869> you

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
won't change that much in the way of you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.190

know end user experience but it will be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.160 
know end user experience but it will be
big<00:01:27.679> in<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.490> whole<00:01:28.819> google<00:01:29.090> vs<00:01:29.630> apple<00:01:29.750> thing

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
between android and iOS google really

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.859 
between android and iOS google really
had<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.050> monopoly<00:01:33.470> on<00:01:33.739> the<00:01:34.009> mobile<00:01:34.869> operating

had a monopoly on the mobile operating
system<00:01:36.319> maps<00:01:36.619> but<00:01:37.099> you<00:01:37.459> know<00:01:37.580> if<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.270> changes

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
system maps but you know if this changes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.120 
system maps but you know if this changes
then<00:01:38.959> Google's<00:01:39.319> going<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.530> lose<00:01:39.709> a<00:01:39.830> lot<00:01:40.099> of

then Google's going to lose a lot of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.589 
then Google's going to lose a lot of
their<00:01:40.429> market<00:01:40.789> share<00:01:40.819> there<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:41.360> it's<00:01:41.509> going

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
their market share there and it's going

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.760
