00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi friends, you are welcome to three 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 college cook recipes today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.110
 we are going to eat a brownie with 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.450
 chocolate and for that we need 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.059
 Butter 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.510
 chocolate is for sugar desserts 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.330
 flour 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.470
 3 handful of about nuts and 4 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.599
 fresh eggs 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 or what always make us a space the 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.880
 table 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.340
 and we are going to calculate the quantities the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 amount of three I will give is for 10 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.800
 people rather for a graphic mold 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 the butter has 250 grams as 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.699
 we take out the 200 grams divided into five 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.699
 parts of the block 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.920
 4 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.410
 living 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.770
 1 2 3 4 and diptychs 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.870
 short and one and we'll have 200 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.309
 grams 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.960
 and until it is not here then what 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.960
 we booked for both 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 for chocolate 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.420
 we need 150 grams as we calculate 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.400
 150 grams 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:19.619
 huesca the bar weighs 25 grams 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.619
 we need 6 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.509
 we take a pot bigger than 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.090
 container in which we have put the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.090
 butter and chocolate 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.950
 and we're going to leave it to the bathroom 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.479
 we take a bowl 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.469
 and we will be the four eggs 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.240
 Now we're going to make sugar like 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.509
 we calculate the amount of sugar then 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 half lid with a little more cap theme 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.200
 of breakfast 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 and now what we have left is to mix the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.060
 sugar for eggs 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.659
 when the bath water starts to 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 boil what we do is turn off the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.250
 fire and we remove it with the same heat 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.710
 it will sink our eyes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.970
 and we continue 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.970
 mixing the sugar 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.340
 we already have as you are checking the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.980
 melted chocolate and now what are they going to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.310
 do is add it to the eggs and the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.310
 sugar 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.630
 and how are we doing all the time to 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.080
 move as if there was not a tomorrow 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.970
 Now let's do is throw the flour 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.390
 how do we calculate the flour traffic 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.110
 Half cup of flour 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.790
 think how we think the flour we are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.010
 the flour on the lid and we're giving it 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.319
 taps so that it will go down that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.050
 is going all the air like this to this 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.510
 half is and we keep mixing well 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.850
 all the ingredients and with this 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.130
 criticism is leaving our blog 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.110
 so you can see how easy and how fast 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.060
 is to make a tap you do not have to 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.410
 put your hand to your head saying ay 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.540
 my god what am I going to make you a brownie 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.200
 we'll be three an hour before 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.600
 nine 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.480
 and we will continue mixing 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.230
 we like them with more nuts to throw more 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.300
 nuts as well as 63 kilos because 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.860
 I would not be a brownie with nuts anymore 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.840
 would be a good example because this already 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.280
 we have and what we are going to do is see it 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 in a bowl that I have a mold of 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.810
 silicone but you need to be thrown out and 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.640
 oil and flour no type of fat 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.800
 so that it does not stick 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.190
 you and you have of all the life then 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.610
 salt flour and butter are not in 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.860
 the mold and my parents and what we are going to 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.200
 to do is to put it in, we have preheated 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.560
 180 degrees and once we have it 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 hot are 180 degrees 40 minutes and since 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.599
 we will have our gray product 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.849
 past the time I have an English 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.380
 this is the look of our blog to 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.880
 we will manage to let it cool 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.880
 and what we have the knife 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 I can not let it cool 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.570
 patient and I'm going to put the knife 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.280
 so you can see how I take it from this 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.920
 way so that I do not disarm 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.750
 many others letting cool during a 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.090
 time and this is what it will look like 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.710
 our blog 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.780
 we take one of the other two and we're going 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.780
 to cut with a thickness of 12 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:46.199
 and now it's just another cut in half 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.000
 and for a dessert today you need a 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.780
 presentation of onetti and for that to take 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.110
 a dish 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.400
 and with strawberry syrup we will throw a drop 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.100
 to see the amount 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:09.889
 and now with a spoon we caught the 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.130
 medium and extend and take the piece 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:17.449
 browning and we put it now we are going to 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.550
 place a full ball on top and a 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.150
 touch of green green that I want to see you 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.190
 a mint leaf for friends I hope 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.650
 that you liked it if it is like this 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.259
 like which one I like and if it's the first 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.940
 Once you see me subscribe to my crazy world 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.940
