 a small descent that will find the portal for the balance we have 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.019
 built with blacks this is an opportunity 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.019

 colors of the asm is used 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.470

 and it's not the first time it's happening to us 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 which means that she can therefore imagine the horror 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 the inscriptions 6 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 they say they will do a little visit 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.210
 here there was a neo-gothic house testing at 1 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 this crisis is everywhere 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.360
 it was the biggest one a few minutes 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 the energy 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.650
 this construction 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 it is enough to the observatory 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210
 the garden in five years 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.960
 the great narbonne 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 dipped in the red

 has the community added 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.330
 we can for m 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 that is why 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 according to comscore 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 the wheel spins 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.390
 the bottom slide 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 the sails 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 load as for the second it is not the words 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649

 maybe it had to get up for the same job 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.729

 you will only have a presentation of the mechanical industries 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.849
 rational 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.799
 but in terms of putting 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.899
 europe afp 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.859
 in this match one way
