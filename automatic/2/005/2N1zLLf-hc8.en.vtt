different<00:00:21.359> types<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.840> fill<00:00:21.960> sessions<00:00:22.260> here

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
different types of fill sessions here

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.240 
different types of fill sessions here
were<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
were going to use but we're going to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
were going to use but we're going to
start<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.359> awesome<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.380> was

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
start with this awesome one that was

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130 
start with this awesome one that was
provided<00:00:25.920> provided<00:00:26.490> by<00:00:26.670> ninja<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
provided provided by ninja it's a lot a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.370 
provided provided by ninja it's a lot a
lot<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.650> user-friendly<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.510> huge<00:00:31.050> part

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
lot more user-friendly now a huge part

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
lot more user-friendly now a huge part
of<00:00:31.500> filling<00:00:31.800> co2<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
of filling co2 is you have to get the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810 
of filling co2 is you have to get the
tank<00:00:33.210> itself<00:00:33.510> cold<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.160> reason<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> because

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
tank itself cold the reason is because

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
tank itself cold the reason is because
as<00:00:36.000> co2<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> liquid<00:00:37.950> when<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.370> flows<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
as co2 is a is a liquid when it flows in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.680 
as co2 is a is a liquid when it flows in
there<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.300> above<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> certain

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
there if it's above a certain

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.910 
there if it's above a certain
temperature<00:00:39.809> it'll<00:00:40.320> turn<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> gas<00:00:40.860> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
temperature it'll turn into a gas you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
temperature it'll turn into a gas you
won't<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> able<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> get<00:00:41.640> enough<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
won't be able to get enough into the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.369 
won't be able to get enough into the
tank<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.920> how<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.120> well<00:00:45.600> since

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
tank now how do we do this well since

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.680 
tank now how do we do this well since
co2<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.890> measured<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.520> weight<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
co2 is measured by weight you need a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.650 
co2 is measured by weight you need a
digital<00:00:48.870> digital<00:00:49.530> scale<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.600> they<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
digital digital scale like this they do

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.299 
digital digital scale like this they do
make<00:00:51.899> analog<00:00:52.289> ones<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.770> suck<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.219> have

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
make analog ones they suck they have

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
make analog ones they suck they have

Springs and I'm Lloyd those things are
only<00:00:56.160> marginally<00:00:56.670> better<00:00:57.059> than<00:00:57.180> guessing

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
only marginally better than guessing

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
only marginally better than guessing
once<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> scale<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.879> course<00:01:00.090> tear

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
once you have a scale on of course tear

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.959 
once you have a scale on of course tear
it<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:01.350> sure<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.760> gas

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it out make sure you actually have gas

it out make sure you actually have gas
going<00:01:03.239> into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> tank<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.870> valve<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.650> open

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
going into the tank so valve is open

going into the tank so valve is open
once<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.439> there

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
once it's there

this<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.700> painless<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
this one it's really painless you just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.899 
this one it's really painless you just
fill<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> you'll<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> numbers<00:01:14.729> start

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
fill it and you'll see the numbers start

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.280 
fill it and you'll see the numbers start
to<00:01:14.970> climb<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> wiggle<00:01:16.140> back<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to climb you can see it wiggle back and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.289 
to climb you can see it wiggle back and
forth<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.740> liquid<00:01:17.070> goes<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> sloshes<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
forth as liquid goes and sloshes in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.899 
forth as liquid goes and sloshes in
there<00:01:18.509> now<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:20.490> only<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.960> know

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
there now it only got to about you know

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.850 
there now it only got to about you know
14<00:01:23.909> ounces<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:24.990> apps<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> continue

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
14 ounces so which apps you to continue

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
14 ounces so which apps you to continue
to<00:01:25.950> till<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> chill<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> tank<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> actually

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to till the chill the tank is actually

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.550 
to till the chill the tank is actually
purged<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> co2<00:01:33.140> couple<00:01:34.140> ounces<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
purged some of the co2 couple ounces is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
purged some of the co2 couple ounces is
usually<00:01:34.890> fine<00:01:35.130> once<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.240> tank

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
usually fine once you have that the tank

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.520 
usually fine once you have that the tank
will<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.600> chilled<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.229> actually<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.500> a

little bit of frost forming down at the
bottom<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:39.900> continue<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> fill<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
bottom and you can continue to fill it
