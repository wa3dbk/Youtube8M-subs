00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the bigger fish and then the tide came

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.350 
the bigger fish and then the tide came
in<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:46.410> coming<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:47.040> good<00:02:47.280> today<00:02:47.519> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
in was coming in pretty good today and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.750 
in was coming in pretty good today and
we<00:02:49.350> continued<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.890> catch<00:02:50.070> fish<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.400> then

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
we continued to catch fish and then

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940 
we continued to catch fish and then
about<00:02:51.030> 3<00:02:51.660> o'clock<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.050> afternoon<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.739> wind

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
about 3 o'clock this afternoon the wind

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.740 
about 3 o'clock this afternoon the wind
started<00:02:53.400> picking<00:02:53.459> out<00:02:53.880> not<00:02:54.120> bad<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.660> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
started picking out not bad just a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.020 
started picking out not bad just a
little<00:02:54.989> breeze<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.489> thought<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.910> was

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
little breeze and I thought that was

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.850 
little breeze and I thought that was
gonna<00:02:57.150> even<00:02:57.510> make<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> bite<00:02:58.050> even<00:02:58.200> better<00:02:58.560> but

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
gonna even make the bite even better but

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.320 
gonna even make the bite even better but
it<00:02:59.040> didn't<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.580> wind<00:02:59.910> didn't<00:03:00.120> really

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
it didn't know the wind didn't really

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.670 
it didn't know the wind didn't really
matter<00:03:00.510> even<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.380> was<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.590> little

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
matter even in this I was a little

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.100 
matter even in this I was a little
worried<00:03:02.190> today<00:03:02.340> without<00:03:03.120> slicked<00:03:03.660> out<00:03:03.840> water

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
