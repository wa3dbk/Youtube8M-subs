prototype<00:00:36.540> alpha<00:00:37.140> jet<00:00:37.410> Jay<00:00:37.769> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.010> built

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
prototype alpha jet Jay and I built

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.119 
prototype alpha jet Jay and I built
prototypes<00:00:38.489> modified<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.040> ironed<00:00:41.040> out

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
prototypes modified them and ironed out

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.540 
prototypes modified them and ironed out
a<00:00:41.190> few<00:00:41.550> different<00:00:42.559> modifications<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> then

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a few different modifications and then

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.969 
a few different modifications and then
Tim<00:00:45.180> came<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> final<00:00:46.229> plan<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
Tim came up with a final plan so this

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.829 
Tim came up with a final plan so this
one<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> still<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.790> prototype<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.659> so

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
one here is still a prototype it's so

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.170 
one here is still a prototype it's so
durable<00:00:49.229> that<00:00:49.979> even<00:00:50.250> after<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.550> few<00:00:50.850> crashes

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
durable that even after a few crashes

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
durable that even after a few crashes
and<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> dings<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.550> still<00:00:54.239> flies<00:00:54.479> great<00:00:54.780> I've

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and and dings it still flies great I've

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.649 
and and dings it still flies great I've

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.970 

I<00:03:29.330> guess<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:30.510> about<00:03:30.600> time<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:31.230> me<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.560> build

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
I guess it's about time for me to build

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.190 
I guess it's about time for me to build
a<00:03:32.130> final<00:03:32.460> version<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.120> alpha<00:03:33.480> jet<00:03:33.660> I've

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
a final version of the alpha jet I've

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.540 
a final version of the alpha jet I've
been<00:03:34.410> flying<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.710> thing<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.070> about<00:03:35.100> eight

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
been flying this thing for about eight

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.280 
been flying this thing for about eight
months<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.120> got<00:03:36.450> gone<00:03:36.750> through<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.080> lot

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
months and it's got gone through a lot

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.230 
months and it's got gone through a lot
so<00:03:37.650> I'm<00:03:37.950> going<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> build<00:03:38.310> myself<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.850> final

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
so I'm going to build myself a final

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.300 
so I'm going to build myself a final
version<00:03:39.420> still<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.350> 2's<00:03:40.680> setup<00:03:41.040> because

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
version still with the 2's setup because

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.820 
version still with the 2's setup because
I<00:03:41.340> love<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.150> same<00:03:42.870> controls<00:03:43.290> elephants

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
I love that and same controls elephants

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.040 
I love that and same controls elephants
and<00:03:44.040> rudders<00:03:44.400> see<00:03:44.640> how<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.910> does<00:03:45.120> without<00:03:45.750> all

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
and rudders see how it does without all

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.790 
and rudders see how it does without all
the<00:03:46.230> glue<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.770> patching<00:03:47.430> on<00:03:47.610> it
