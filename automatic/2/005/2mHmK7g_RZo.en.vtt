probably<00:01:48.460> late<00:01:48.580> probably<00:01:49.030> already<00:01:49.120> decided

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
probably late probably already decided

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.110 
probably late probably already decided
where<00:01:50.020> we're<00:01:50.110> going<00:01:50.380> but<00:01:50.700> Miller<00:01:51.700> was<00:01:51.940> great

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
where we're going but Miller was great

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.880 
where we're going but Miller was great
he<00:01:52.240> got<00:01:52.360> us<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.510> this<00:01:52.690> game<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.770> know<00:01:53.860> I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
he got us to this game and you know I

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.640 
he got us to this game and you know I
didn't<00:01:54.100> work<00:01:54.220> for<00:01:54.400> us<00:01:54.460> tonight<00:02:00.480> a<00:02:01.650> shootout

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
didn't work for us tonight a shootout

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.600 
didn't work for us tonight a shootout
game<00:02:02.920> there

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
game there

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.460 
game there
now<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.850> know<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:07.970> thought<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:09.080> thought

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
now you know I thought that I thought

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.810 
now you know I thought that I thought
Hanson's<00:02:09.979> been<00:02:10.130> good<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.490> twins<00:02:10.700> I

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
Hanson's been good with the twins I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.580 
Hanson's been good with the twins I
thought<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.180> they<00:02:11.630> created<00:02:12.050> all<00:02:12.140> series

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
thought that they created all series

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.050 
thought that they created all series
like<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.310> know<00:02:13.370> always<00:02:13.490> be<00:02:13.670> different<00:02:14.000> if

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
like you know always be different if

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.340 
like you know always be different if
they<00:02:14.150> hadn't<00:02:14.420> created<00:02:14.570> but<00:02:14.810> they<00:02:14.900> created<00:02:15.230> for

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
they hadn't created but they created for

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.990 
they hadn't created but they created for
the<00:02:15.410> last<00:02:15.590> two<00:02:15.740> games<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.760> know<00:02:16.850> why

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
the last two games and you know why

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the last two games and you know why
would<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.240> change<00:02:17.480> it

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
would you change it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.690 
would you change it
he<00:02:18.530> got<00:02:18.680> time<00:02:18.860> with<00:02:18.980> him<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.280> powerplay

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
he got time with him on the powerplay

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490 
he got time with him on the powerplay
and<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> little<00:02:20.270> bit<00:02:20.360> later<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.690> use<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.320> there

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and a little bit later I use in there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.350 
and a little bit later I use in there
but<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.460> know<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.550> thought<00:02:22.670> Hanson<00:02:23.030> had<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> good

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
but you know I thought Hanson had a good

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.620 
but you know I thought Hanson had a good
series<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:30.800> they<00:02:31.010> work<00:02:31.430> hard<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.510> know<00:02:32.600> I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
series I think they work hard you know I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.910 
series I think they work hard you know I
think<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.930> keep<00:02:33.080> coming<00:02:33.470> there<00:02:33.590> D<00:02:33.740> were

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
think to keep coming there D were

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.590 
think to keep coming there D were
addicted<00:02:34.610> you've<00:02:34.970> got<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> little<00:02:35.270> bit<00:02:35.450> tired

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
addicted you've got a little bit tired

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.650 
addicted you've got a little bit tired
towards<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> end<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:36.700> they<00:02:37.700> battled<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
towards the end but they battled and and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.820 
towards the end but they battled and and
they<00:02:38.840> found<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.170> way<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.410> think<00:02:39.590> that's<00:02:39.740> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
they found a way and I think that's the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.260 
they found a way and I think that's the
biggest<00:02:40.010> thing<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.340> any<00:02:40.460> series<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.060> just

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
biggest thing in any series is just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.510 
biggest thing in any series is just
finding<00:02:41.900> away<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.140> think<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:43.130> know<00:02:43.220> they're<00:02:43.400> in

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
finding away I think you know they're in

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.910 
finding away I think you know they're in
a<00:02:43.610> tough<00:02:43.760> spot<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.390> they<00:02:44.750> came<00:02:44.930> back<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.410> you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
a tough spot and they came back so you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.410 
a tough spot and they came back so you
got<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> give<00:02:46.190> him<00:02:46.250> credit<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.850> think<00:02:47.120> they've

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
got to give him credit I think they've

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.390 
got to give him credit I think they've
done<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.720> all<00:02:47.810> year<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:49.100> know<00:02:49.190> they<00:02:49.340> were

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
done it all year and you know they were

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.070 
done it all year and you know they were
they<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.090> tonight<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.360> think<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.780> any<00:02:50.840> way

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
they got it tonight you think in any way

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.540 
they got it tonight you think in any way
they<00:02:51.230> wore<00:02:51.470> down<00:02:51.650> something<00:02:51.950> parity<00:02:52.340> with

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
they wore down something parity with

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.480 
they wore down something parity with
alder<00:02:55.810> that's<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.930> tough<00:02:57.080> question<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.370> know

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
alder that's a tough question I you know

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.810 
alder that's a tough question I you know
I<00:02:59.140> mean<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.380> don't<00:03:00.440> know<00:03:00.770> they<00:03:01.459> played<00:03:01.700> hard

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
I mean I don't know they played hard

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.949 
I mean I don't know they played hard
though<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.060> was<00:03:02.209> tough<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.420> was<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.750> tough

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
though it was tough it was a tough

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.580 
though it was tough it was a tough
series<00:03:03.170> for<00:03:03.470> D<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:05.170> obviously<00:03:06.170> they<00:03:06.320> found<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
series for D but obviously they found a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.780 
series for D but obviously they found a
way<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.770> get<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.130> NAND<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.430> got<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.580> couple

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
way to get to the NAND they got a couple

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.000 
way to get to the NAND they got a couple
late<00:03:08.000> ones<00:03:08.150> going<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> net<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.140> know

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
late ones going to the net so you know

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.470 
late ones going to the net so you know
maybe<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.250> did<00:03:10.459> where<00:03:10.640> Miller<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.269> bunch

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480

in<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.320> going<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> hard<00:03:34.830> series<00:03:35.190> and

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
in it was going to be a hard series and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.710 
in it was going to be a hard series and
I<00:03:35.370> think<00:03:35.400> even<00:03:35.730> though<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.120> knew<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.360> was<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.480> hard

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
I think even though I knew it was a hard

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.230 
I think even though I knew it was a hard
series<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.920> think<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.700> games<00:03:38.880> were<00:03:39.060> there

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
series and I think the games were there

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.000 
series and I think the games were there
and<00:03:39.360> we<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.480> didn't<00:03:39.810> quite<00:03:39.930> seize<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.860> get

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
and we just didn't quite seize it to get

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.560 
and we just didn't quite seize it to get
it<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.880> know<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> difference

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
it in you know I think the difference

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.060 
it in you know I think the difference
was<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.780> first<00:03:42.990> game<00:03:43.200> they<00:03:43.500> scored<00:03:43.800> with<00:03:43.890> 30

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
was the first game they scored with 30

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.760 
was the first game they scored with 30
seconds<00:03:44.490> left<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.850> first<00:03:45.000> game<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.300> and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
seconds left in the first game and and

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.900 
seconds left in the first game and and
you<00:03:46.770> know<00:03:46.860> we<00:03:47.010> had<00:03:47.130> our<00:03:47.220> chance<00:03:47.459> earlier<00:03:47.820> than

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you know we had our chance earlier than

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
you know we had our chance earlier than
that<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.120> they<00:03:48.180> scored<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.660> one<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
that and they scored on that one and

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.199 
that and they scored on that one and
that<00:03:49.440> was<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> difference<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.100> give<00:03:51.090> them

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
that was a difference so give them

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.560 
that was a difference so give them
credit

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.610 

whenever<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.720> lose<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.110> always<00:03:58.350> look<00:03:58.500> at

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
whenever you lose you always look at

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410 
whenever you lose you always look at
something<00:03:58.920> different<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.340> obviously<00:03:59.760> when

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
something different like obviously when

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.540 
something different like obviously when
you<00:04:00.510> lose<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.800> wasn't<00:04:02.130> what<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.310> wanted

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
you lose and that wasn't what you wanted

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.850 
you lose and that wasn't what you wanted
to<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.140> give<00:04:04.140> them<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.290> same<00:04:04.470> information

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
to do but give them the same information

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.110 
to do but give them the same information
I<00:04:05.070> had<00:04:05.220> at<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.370> time<00:04:05.640> I'd<00:04:05.820> have<00:04:05.910> made<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
I had at that time I'd have made the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.610 
I had at that time I'd have made the
same<00:04:06.300> choices<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:08.190> know<00:04:09.050> you<00:04:10.050> know<00:04:10.140> all<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.500> can
