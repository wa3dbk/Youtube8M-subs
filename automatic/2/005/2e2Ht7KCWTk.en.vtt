00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
it off a handheld computer we see the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.410 
it off a handheld computer we see the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
icon of the flier right there and we

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.570 
icon of the flier right there and we
have<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.660> map<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.080> area<00:01:32.350> over<00:01:32.920> here<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
have the map of the area over here so

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.240 
have the map of the area over here so
you're<00:01:33.759> just<00:01:34.000> moving<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.479> around<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
you're just moving it around and it's

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.969 
you're just moving it around and it's
recording<00:01:41.940> yep<00:01:42.959> so<00:01:43.959> what<00:01:44.140> kind<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.410> data<00:01:44.679> is

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
recording yep so what kind of data is

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.100 
recording yep so what kind of data is
the<00:01:45.250> drone<00:01:45.520> sending<00:01:46.090> back<00:01:46.330> some<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.990> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the drone sending back some of the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.830 
the drone sending back some of the
Flyers<00:01:47.410> who<00:01:47.830> are<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.009> Nepal<00:01:48.340> yep<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.179> drone<00:01:49.720> is

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
Flyers who are in Nepal yep the drone is

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.630 
Flyers who are in Nepal yep the drone is
actually<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.259> UAVs<00:01:50.590> actually<00:01:50.979> sent<00:01:51.220> sending

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
actually the UAVs actually sent sending

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually the UAVs actually sent sending
back<00:01:51.789> data<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:53.170> includes<00:01:53.340> standard<00:01:54.340> HD

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
back data that includes standard HD

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.120 
back data that includes standard HD
imaging<00:01:55.200> thermal<00:01:56.200> imaging<00:01:56.770> which<00:01:56.979> is

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
imaging thermal imaging which is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.339 
imaging thermal imaging which is
actually<00:01:57.580> heat<00:01:57.880> signature<00:01:58.330> imaging<00:01:58.690> so<00:01:59.229> at

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
actually heat signature imaging so at

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.559 
actually heat signature imaging so at
night<00:01:59.530> we<00:01:59.709> can<00:01:59.830> actually<00:02:00.220> see<00:02:00.520> if<00:02:00.789> there's<00:02:01.330> if

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
night we can actually see if there's if

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.969 
night we can actually see if there's if
there's<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.899> person<00:02:02.110> or<00:02:02.410> pockets<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.860> people

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
there's a person or pockets of people

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.380 
there's a person or pockets of people
that<00:02:03.280> are<00:02:03.369> maybe<00:02:03.490> stranded<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.149> we<00:02:04.240> weren't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
that are maybe stranded that we weren't

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.710 
that are maybe stranded that we weren't
aware

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.930 

so<00:02:09.290> it<00:02:09.350> kind<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.620> does<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:09.860> we<00:02:10.190> always<00:02:10.580> wanted

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
so it kind of does what we always wanted

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.790 
so it kind of does what we always wanted
to<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.270> was<00:02:11.510> be<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> bird<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.290> get<00:02:12.440> up<00:02:12.560> high<00:02:12.770> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
to do was be a bird to get up high and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.370 
to do was be a bird to get up high and
get<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.250> good<00:02:13.490> aerial<00:02:14.330> view<00:02:14.570> absolutely<00:02:14.840> we

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
get a good aerial view absolutely we

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.570 
get a good aerial view absolutely we
take<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> bunch<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.890> images<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.430> actually

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
take a bunch of images and we actually

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.430 
take a bunch of images and we actually
stitch<00:02:16.970> them<00:02:17.180> together<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.410> gives

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
stitch them together and what that gives

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.480 
stitch them together and what that gives
us<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.270> real<00:02:20.270> 3d<00:02:20.780> picture<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.490> what's

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
us is a real 3d picture of what's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.130 
us is a real 3d picture of what's
actually<00:02:22.670> happening<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.570> ground<00:02:23.690> real

you can stay up fifty minutes roughly
before<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.510> battery<00:02:50.840> change<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:52.100> can<00:02:52.130> hover

from<00:02:58.520> 300<00:02:59.270> meters<00:02:59.300> up<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.890> hear<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.310> lot<00:03:01.550> about

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
from 300 meters up we hear a lot about

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.930 
from 300 meters up we hear a lot about
toy<00:03:02.420> drones<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.350> know<00:03:03.440> people<00:03:04.280> worried<00:03:04.850> about

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
toy drones you know people worried about

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.350 
toy drones you know people worried about
privacy<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.900> big<00:03:06.860> drones<00:03:07.190> which<00:03:07.580> kill<00:03:07.940> people

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
privacy and big drones which kill people

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.320 
privacy and big drones which kill people
so<00:03:08.990> where<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.160> in<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.550> continuum<00:03:10.910> in

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
so where is this in that continuum in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270 
so where is this in that continuum in
our<00:03:11.480> particular<00:03:11.780> category<00:03:12.500> they're<00:03:13.100> there

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
our particular category they're there

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640 
our particular category they're there
for<00:03:13.670> things<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:14.870> things<00:03:15.230> where<00:03:15.410> we<00:03:15.500> can

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
for things like this things where we can

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.920 
for things like this things where we can
actually<00:03:15.770> help<00:03:16.130> people<00:03:16.480> make<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> difference

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
actually help people make a difference

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.290 
actually help people make a difference
you<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.040> don't<00:03:19.160> arm<00:03:19.459> our<00:03:19.670> systems<00:03:20.060> what

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
you know we don't arm our systems what

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.820 
you know we don't arm our systems what
we<00:03:20.390> arm<00:03:20.570> them<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.020> intelligence<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:21.709> that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
we arm them with is intelligence so that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.890 
we arm them with is intelligence so that
people<00:03:22.070> can<00:03:22.220> collect<00:03:22.430> information<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:23.810> make
