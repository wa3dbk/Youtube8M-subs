scared a few old ladies with this
exhaust<00:00:31.990> system<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:33.010> started<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.460> make<00:00:33.610> me

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
exhaust system and it started to make me

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.569 
exhaust system and it started to make me
wonder<00:00:34.090> if<00:00:34.570> I<00:00:34.930> should<00:00:35.590> maybe<00:00:35.860> get<00:00:36.130> something<00:00:36.400> a

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
wonder if I should maybe get something a

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.430 
wonder if I should maybe get something a
little<00:00:36.790> quieter<00:00:36.910> I<00:00:37.420> love<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:38.020> way<00:00:38.170> this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
little quieter I love the way this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.100 
little quieter I love the way this
sounds<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.520> definitely<00:00:40.510> very<00:00:40.989> very

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
sounds but it's definitely very very

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
sounds but it's definitely very very
aggressive<00:00:41.800> very<00:00:41.829> very<00:00:42.220> loud<00:00:42.460> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
aggressive very very loud and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.509 
aggressive very very loud and
as<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.089> daily<00:00:45.390> driver<00:00:45.620> I'm<00:00:46.620> finding<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.339> be<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
as a daily driver I'm finding it to be a

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.180 
as a daily driver I'm finding it to be a
little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.329> tiresome

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
little bit tiresome

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.750 
little bit tiresome
just<00:00:49.340> having<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:49.789> constant

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
just having that constant

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.810 
just having that constant
her<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.420> your<00:00:52.539> ears<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:53.289> kind<00:00:53.559> of

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
her and your ears can kind of

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.610 
her and your ears can kind of
just<00:00:55.450> make<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:55.780> little<00:00:55.900> more<00:00:56.079> tired<00:00:56.380> than

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
just make you a little more tired than

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.299 
just make you a little more tired than
fatigue<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:58.239> anyway<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:59.800> thinking<00:00:59.860> about

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
fatigue you so anyway I'm thinking about

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.160 
fatigue you so anyway I'm thinking about
replacing<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.910> with<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> parent<00:01:01.570> I'm<00:01:01.750> not<00:01:01.930> sure

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
replacing it with a parent I'm not sure

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.960 
replacing it with a parent I'm not sure
if<00:01:02.260> I'm<00:01:02.380> going<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.650> do<00:01:02.770> it<00:01:02.920> yet<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:03.309> I've<00:01:03.760> heard

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
if I'm going to do it yet but I've heard

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.700 
if I'm going to do it yet but I've heard
the<00:01:04.120> parents<00:01:04.540> quieter<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.260> parent<00:01:05.590> has<00:01:05.680> a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
the parents quieter the parent has a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.730 
the parents quieter the parent has a
similar<00:01:06.100> tone<00:01:06.370> to<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.760> one

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
similar tone to this one

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.170 
similar tone to this one
not<00:01:09.070> sure<00:01:09.370> if<00:01:09.490> I'm<00:01:09.580> going<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.760> make<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:09.970> wish

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
not sure if I'm going to make this wish

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.760 
not sure if I'm going to make this wish
Jesse<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.750> might<00:01:10.990> actually<00:01:11.229> instead<00:01:11.710> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
Jesse and I might actually instead of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.940 
Jesse and I might actually instead of
this<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.250> header<00:01:12.460> back<00:01:12.760> system<00:01:13.320> SRT<00:01:14.320> has<00:01:14.560> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
this is a header back system SRT has the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.250 
this is a header back system SRT has the
catback<00:01:15.490> system<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.119> basically<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.810> can<00:01:17.229> just

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
catback system so basically I can just

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.149 
catback system so basically I can just
put<00:01:17.590> in<00:01:17.770> my<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.850> know<00:01:19.140> mid<00:01:20.140> my<00:01:20.380> bit<00:01:20.619> mid<00:01:20.890> pipe

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
put in my you know mid my bit mid pipe

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.070 
put in my you know mid my bit mid pipe
that<00:01:21.400> goes<00:01:21.430> from<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.180> know<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> headers<00:01:22.720> to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
that goes from you know the headers to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.960 
that goes from you know the headers to
the<00:01:23.290> catback<00:01:23.710> portion<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.369> can<00:01:24.549> replace<00:01:24.909> that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
the catback portion I can replace that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.359 
the catback portion I can replace that
with<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> stock<00:01:25.800> portion<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.220> know

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
with the stock portion and you know

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.260 
with the stock portion and you know
hopefully<00:01:27.759> bring<00:01:28.090> on<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
hopefully bring on the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.849 
hopefully bring on the
sound<00:01:29.539> level<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> little<00:01:30.140> bit<00:01:30.289> so<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.680> is<00:01:30.770> not

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
sound level a little bit so this is not

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.440 
sound level a little bit so this is not
quite<00:01:31.039> as<00:01:31.280> loud<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:31.789> I'm<00:01:31.880> considering<00:01:32.270> maybe

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
quite as loud so I'm considering maybe

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.990 
quite as loud so I'm considering maybe
doing<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.689> too<00:01:33.140> but<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.219> do<00:01:34.340> lose<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> little

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
doing that too but you do lose a little

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.969 
doing that too but you do lose a little
bit<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.210> power<00:01:35.509> switching<00:01:36.350> from<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.649> header

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
bit of power switching from the header

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.569 
bit of power switching from the header
back<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.429> catback<00:01:37.960> but<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.619> know<00:01:39.740> losing

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
back to the catback but you know losing

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.539 
back to the catback but you know losing
a<00:01:40.939> couple<00:01:41.329> horsepower<00:01:41.929> are<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:43.189> the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
a couple horsepower are you in the

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.309 
a couple horsepower are you in the
effort<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.240> bring<00:01:44.450> down<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.780> volume<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.289> think

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
effort to bring down the volume I think

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.539 
effort to bring down the volume I think
it's<00:01:45.619> something<00:01:45.799> would<00:01:46.009> probably<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.399> worth

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
it's something would probably be worth

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's something would probably be worth
it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
it
but<00:01:48.390> yeah<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.689> not<00:01:48.720> however<00:01:49.200> since<00:01:49.350> earned<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
but yeah I'm not however since earned on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.870 
but yeah I'm not however since earned on
that<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.250> trying<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> consider

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that I'm just trying to consider

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
that I'm just trying to consider
switching<00:01:51.119> exhaust<00:01:51.659> systems<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
switching exhaust systems because it is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.460 
switching exhaust systems because it is
definitely<00:01:52.979> loud<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.600> obnoxious<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
definitely loud and can be obnoxious you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
definitely loud and can be obnoxious you
know<00:01:55.590> whenever<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.920> driving<00:01:56.400> through

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
know whenever you're driving through

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.070 
know whenever you're driving through
neighborhoods<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
neighborhoods and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.440 
neighborhoods and
stuff<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.430> considering<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> that's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
stuff so just considering that that's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.750 
stuff so just considering that that's

so I got a question yesterday that I've
been<00:03:16.180> getting<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.900> lot<00:03:17.290> of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.270 

and<00:03:21.040> that's<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.849> question<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.329> why

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and that's the question of why

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.550 
and that's the question of why
the<00:03:23.550> BRC<00:03:24.120> over<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> fr-s

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.580 

in<00:03:27.709> America<00:03:28.400> it's<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.670> pretty<00:03:29.270> easy<00:03:29.599> choice<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
in America it's a pretty easy choice I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.589 
in America it's a pretty easy choice I
think<00:03:30.650> compared<00:03:31.400> with<00:03:31.580> the<00:03:32.150> rest<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
think compared with the rest of the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.860 
think compared with the rest of the
world<00:03:32.870> where<00:03:33.230> it's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
world where it's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.059 
world where it's
complicated<00:03:35.590> so

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
complicated so

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.910 
complicated so
in<00:03:37.579> America<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.599> have<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.989> choose<00:03:39.200> from<00:03:39.530> is

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
in America all we have to choose from is

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.869

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
the BRZ or the Scion fr-s the FRS is

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.510 
the BRZ or the Scion fr-s the FRS is
these

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
basic car so you know the FRS doesn't

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.949 
basic car so you know the FRS doesn't
have<00:03:49.150> any<00:03:49.300> of

premium one or two get the standard FRS
the<00:05:00.199> difference<00:05:00.470> between<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.800> FRS<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.280> the

the difference between the FRS in the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.999 
the difference between the FRS in the
BRC<00:05:01.849> base<00:05:02.509> model<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.139> only<00:05:03.199> a<00:05:03.379> thousand<00:05:03.860> dollar

BRC base model is only a thousand dollar

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.399 
BRC base model is only a thousand dollar
difference<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:05.030> if<00:05:05.120> there<00:05:05.509> was<00:05:05.629> no<00:05:05.810> difference

base<00:06:08.280> B<00:06:08.490> or<00:06:08.639> Z<00:06:08.850> for<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.120> same<00:06:09.330> price<00:06:09.660> as<00:06:09.690> an<00:06:09.960> FRS

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
base B or Z for the same price as an FRS

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.150 
base B or Z for the same price as an FRS
so<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:12.300> me<00:06:12.479> I<00:06:12.810> think<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.260> BRZ<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.800> a<00:06:13.889> slightly

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
so to me I think the BRZ is a slightly

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.370 
so to me I think the BRZ is a slightly
better<00:06:14.310> value<00:06:14.850> you<00:06:15.240> know<00:06:15.360> for<00:06:15.540> your<00:06:15.660> money<00:06:15.840> now

their slightly softer rear springs I

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.750 
their slightly softer rear springs I
believe<00:07:17.360> on<00:07:17.630> the<00:07:17.810> FRS<00:07:18.380> versus<00:07:19.220> this<00:07:19.370> car<00:07:19.580> so

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
believe on the FRS versus this car so

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.360 
believe on the FRS versus this car so
the<00:07:19.880> FRS<00:07:20.240> is<00:07:20.360> a<00:07:20.390> slight<00:07:21.080> bit<00:07:21.590> more<00:07:21.980> prone<00:07:22.340> to

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.370 
the FRS is a slight bit more prone to

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.430 
the FRS is a slight bit more prone to
oversteer<00:07:23.060> than<00:07:23.330> the<00:07:23.420> BRZ<00:07:23.750> the<00:07:24.050> beers<00:07:24.290> he's

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 
oversteer than the BRZ the beers he's

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.690 
oversteer than the BRZ the beers he's
set<00:07:24.740> up<00:07:24.770> to<00:07:24.980> be<00:07:25.100> a<00:07:25.130> little<00:07:25.370> more<00:07:25.490> neutral

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
set up to be a little more neutral

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.940 
set up to be a little more neutral
handling<00:07:26.330> but<00:07:26.810> they're<00:07:27.020> still<00:07:27.260> very<00:07:27.620> very

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:27.950 
handling but they're still very very

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.950 
handling but they're still very very
very<00:07:28.130> similar<00:07:28.490> it's<00:07:28.820> not<00:07:29.060> like<00:07:29.420> this<00:07:29.630> feels

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
very similar it's not like this feels

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.180 
very similar it's not like this feels
like<00:07:30.080> an<00:07:30.230> all-wheel<00:07:30.500> drive<00:07:30.710> car<00:07:30.950> and<00:07:31.070> that

like an all-wheel drive car and that

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.980 
like an all-wheel drive car and that
feels<00:07:31.400> like<00:07:31.550> a<00:07:31.640> crazy<00:07:31.940> you<00:07:32.270> know<00:07:32.420> Mercedes<00:07:32.870> AMG
