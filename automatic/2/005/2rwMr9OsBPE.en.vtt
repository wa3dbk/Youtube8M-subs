00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi all the guys are z willings 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 and today I'm here with a new video of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
 gta 5 in which I will tell you about peace 1.10 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.200
 in this video, however, you don't see the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.150
 contents of the valentine's day massacre 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.500
 for the simple fact that a lot 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.750
 probably these contents 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 will become free on Saint's Day 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.109
 valentino and via this video I am 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.480
 doing the day before Valentine's Day 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.150
 when all the contents of the massacre of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.250
 Valentine's Day are still paid e 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 for a fee I mean I know I digi.to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
 online and not gta 5 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.750
 however, if tomorrow I discover that these 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 contents are also paid 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.950
 however, the video will do it for 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 I wait and see if 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 they will become free, for example 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 the car is really expensive 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 let's start immediately with the videos and the most 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 great novelty of this peace is the plow 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.399
 eder you can buy for free 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.739
 on the sufers hooper san andreas site 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 once purchased obviously will be in the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.860
 your garage does not say right 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.879
 purchased because it is anyway 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.500
 Free 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 When will our garage the can 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 obviously empower everyone and I repeat 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 all upgrades are free 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 all paints all objects 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 that enhance the speed of yours 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 vehicle as well as armor and brakes 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 practically all all the upgrades 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.189
 of this car I'm free talking about 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 other vehicle news the dog vehicle 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.000
 seminole and now parkable in the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.159
 your garage while the vehicle 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.560
 of the American heather of the mercenaries 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.180
 now you can no longer sell though 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 however it will always be insurable 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.750
 parkable in your garage 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.460
 another great novelty of this patch e 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.259
 that now all the stolen vehicles for 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.619
 street have a total value of 10,000 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.630
 dollars 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 for example, if you steal a quick minister 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 maximized this value 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.340
 however, despite $ 10,000 in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 previous passes were worth $ 118,000 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.549
 now this rule has been set to 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.350
 all the vehicles you find on the street 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.149
 and also the personal car of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.649
 Franklin Clinton instead for how much 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.659
 concerns the michael de santa machine 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 this is still salable at a price 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.430
 very high if obviously upgraded to 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.750
 maximum in the 1.10 patch also have 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 added in inventing the option 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.710
 Attack priority to friends you can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 set the standard or lower 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.489
 will be set practically low 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 your character will not use the car 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.200
 aim at one of your friends when 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.530
 you will play the friendly fire though 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.740
 Sara 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.750
 however active if I am not mistaken, however, two 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.150
 friends set this option to 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.430
 low these if you shoot each other not 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.680
 however, they suffer no damage from this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'm sure it is anyway 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.910
 always a pretty useful option 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.459
 in the voting of the activity they have then 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.590
 added icons on the activities so 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.170
 you will understand what activity it is 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.730
 precisely through these things if you call 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.280
 the mechanic to request a vehicle 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 practically the mechanic instead of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.209
 deliver the vehicle in front of you 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.610
 will leave it parked on one spot 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.530
 which you will see on the radar if you set the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.750
 passive mode and they kill you and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 passive mode your friends will have to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.860
 pay for medical treatment so you don't 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.110
 you will lose any money when there 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.030
 finally kill in passive mode 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.950
 have added two return options 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.680
 as well as having last position e 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.780
 properties have added garage and random 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.940
 make it practically would be when 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.470
 Access your account online 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.410
 character will get married at one point 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 random map then when 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.069
 practically completed a mission 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.829
 this mission will not be saved either 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.680
 activities and finally added the 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.019
 confirm in the option buy all 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.630
 ammunition that would be the button that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.030
 appears before you start an activity 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.320
 any where you shoot them 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.940

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.010
