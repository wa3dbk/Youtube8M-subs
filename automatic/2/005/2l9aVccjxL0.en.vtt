00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.700
 how about friends today I bring you a 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.830
 new video in which I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.090
 this an application that I think is 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.930
 pretty good this drawer is called 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.930
 what is this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.470
 I like it because we can see more than anything 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.500
 live television 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.259
 this here come the best programs 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.169
 what has Aztec and live by 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.720
 example here is the island the reality I 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.280
 I see it just for being the king and visit 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.309
 when is the hour that approximately 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 eight thirty from Monday to Thursday 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.180
 I start to see and good for example 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.500
 right now is what we keep quiet about 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.129
 women right now we are seeing that it is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.129
 so commercial 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 it's just a bit late 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.770
 ready 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.170
 well here they are just using the 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.450
 commercial 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.979
 but it 's what I like that you can see 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.350
 the television totally live only 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.259
 you need 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.400
 and have a data connection either a 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 wifi connection a wireless connection or 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.540
 be with the data network that does not 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.180
 I recommend it a lot because if it consumes you 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.700
 many data 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.980
 but the important thing is that we can see the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.400
 television totally live obviously 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.720
 that goes a little more backward but what 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.230
 important is that we can see it and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.380
 enjoy 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.439
 well here we are seeing the example 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.119
 this has happened now and there is the 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.170
 another commercial that I just left does 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.000
 just a moment 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
 totally live the quality is 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.490
 pretty good me personally 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.890
 like not to be very distorted I do not know 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.630
 distorted the quality 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 It's pretty good 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.720
 good for example is live newscast 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.720
 we'll see 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.739
 cast 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.410
 and so and according to this we can also see 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.020
 News 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.040
 some videos that shows you here and the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.710
 galleries is live and the news 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.420
 good to download it we go to 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.599
 the store in this case I have it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.739
 with the windows store we are going to look for you 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.739
 we put Aztec 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.750
 and here this box appears and what 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.750
 we download we give in install or yes 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.790
 and then it would be good
