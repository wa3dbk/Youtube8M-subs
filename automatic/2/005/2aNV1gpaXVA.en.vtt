be<00:03:54.580> solved<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.150> little<00:03:55.450> understanding

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.560 

but<00:03:59.620> don't<00:03:59.830> get<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.100> wrong<00:04:00.190> idea<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.390> be

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
but don't get the wrong idea I can be

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.900 
but don't get the wrong idea I can be
tough<00:04:01.780> when<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:02.110> am

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
but I like to think that every citizen

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.220 
but I like to think that every citizen
on<00:04:10.400> Lego<00:04:10.730> Island<00:04:10.880> has<00:04:11.270> a<00:04:11.300> friend<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:11.960> Laura
