00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.680
 all 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.580
 good 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.580
 oh yes 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 we 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.719
 hello it's eric of the blog 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.550
 learning the guitar point fr then 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.699
 today I propose you to take the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.920
 piece zombies cranberries so that's 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.170
 a very easy very simple piece 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.000
 four chords the four chords are 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.100
 so more super simplified 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.080
 it's really the piece that I 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.850
 advises all mutants those who 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 want to start here it should be 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 the first piece we learn at the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.240
 guitar so this video is in two 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.369
 parts 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.990
 first part I will explain 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.990
 how to play the chords and the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.490
 rhythmic and a second part so 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.490
 under the video I will put a link 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.960
 to a second video that in 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.610
 which I will explain the little 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.399
 solo who initially 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250
 so we'll start right away 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:39.690
 you'll see it's very simple 4.5 in 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.690
 remember first agreement agreement of mina 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.229
 then second chord it's a 7th back 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.149
 major then started a bostjan 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.450
 bad luck it's very easy we do like 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.099
 a back deal except that we do not put the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 nex so we will only end up 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:05.099
 with the middle finger on the third string 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.209
 second box and the third ring 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.209
 box of the second string 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.980
 then a ground agreement but only 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.420
 with his right one year ago then 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 only on the first rope 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.590
 third box second rope second 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.590
 still ground box all that 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.980
 and finally the last agreement so that's 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.710
 an agreement of dirt and jazz dub nador and 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.240
 basta james leap in reality that's it 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.590
 very simple to remember the agreement 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.360
 you just hit the first string 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.840
 second box here is right on it and 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.840
 you play that 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.019
 here you have learned to play at best 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.709
 cranberries one of the biggest tubes 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.080
 planetary 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.120
 ah yeah you want to know the rhythmic 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.080
 then does not happen nor that she is very 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.670
 simple it's always rock rhythm 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 mao down my my my skin going and repeat 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 the four benefits to my ba ba at the bottom 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.610
 word and that's it and the piece turns 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.750
 basically on it so we're going 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.750
 play minor 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.180
 the back bah my share 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.780
 bah 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.780
 single parent 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.900
 and the fn to jason our there to 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.670
 So that's the piece 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.090
 so when you played with a 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.890
 singer or singer he'll have to 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.110
 we tried a little bit of nuances and 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.550
 the piece so the introduction you 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.940
 can really play all the strings 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.940
 Everytime 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.790
 and then there will be times when we are a 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.650
 little bit calmed the piece when we have 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.020
 calmed the piece does one go instead of 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.360
 play six strings like these one go 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.880
 just play and try to play them 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.410
 three biggest strings on the horns 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.170
 of basset en vitier play that these three 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.290
 strings and at the same you can insist there 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.290
 above 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.990
 when I play the three bath bodies in 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.520
 I do not do it all the time baba bas 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.960
 high down we can do it but here you go 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.809
 to aim more easily in fact I 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.669
 do that debate that respects the lab 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:08.379
 good ethnik it's not very conventional 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.539
 but here is baaba not good here we are 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.069
 respects well and boarding insisted 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.159
 than on the bass to calm a little the 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.159
 world 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.320
 alas how the singer takes over the 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.320
 refrain 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.650
 here it is an uncomplicated piece 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.900
 it's really the piece I'm telling you 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.789
 advise as being the first piece 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.669
 that you have to learn is really 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.110
 this one so we have two parts you 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.580
 play well all the strings you in 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.349
 see there you will be able to burst 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.789
 and then you calm down a little bit the game 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.229
 then you always keep the same 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.300
 rhythm it has to last the same time 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.210
 but just 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.039
 we are sixth at three strings sassi have a 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.159
 a bit heavy for roy like that who 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.530
 go outside 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:20.330
 here it is nice and here I think 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.370
 that you are going to burst 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.129
 you want to learn the little solo of 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.050
 start you have a link under the video 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.470
 otherwise I'll see you soon for a 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.470
 new video
