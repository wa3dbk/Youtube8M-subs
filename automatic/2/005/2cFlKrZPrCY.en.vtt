version and why am i using this version

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.069 
version and why am i using this version
because<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.510> preferences<00:00:31.260> i<00:00:32.329> can<00:00:33.329> turn<00:00:33.750> off

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
because in preferences i can turn off

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
because in preferences i can turn off
the<00:00:34.320> smart<00:00:34.680> highlighting<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> new<00:00:35.730> version

the smart highlighting and a new version

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.750 
the smart highlighting and a new version
doesn't<00:00:36.360> let<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.280> why<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.579> that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
doesn't let you do that and why is that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
with the middle mouse button option and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.210 
with the middle mouse button option and
see<00:02:17.930> how<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.290> right<00:02:18.530> now<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:18.770> don't<00:02:19.040> want

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
see how it is right now you don't want

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.790 
see how it is right now you don't want
it<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.200> an<00:02:21.410> average

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
it like that because it is an average

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.020 
it like that because it is an average
mode<00:02:22.070> if<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> look<00:02:22.610> at<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.830> bottom<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
mode if you look at the bottom of the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
mode if you look at the bottom of the
window<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.450> will<00:02:26.780> see<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.540> am<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:29.959> to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
window you will see it so I am going to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.020 
window you will see it so I am going to
hit<00:02:30.280> 24<00:02:31.280> long<00:02:31.610> edges<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:34.040> long<00:02:34.370> edges<00:02:34.640> mother

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
hit 24 long edges it's long edges mother

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.120 
hit 24 long edges it's long edges mother
now<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.910> use<00:02:38.900> constraints<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.830> have

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
now so just use constraints so I have

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.630 
now so just use constraints so I have
consistency<00:02:40.790> I'm<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.450> using<00:02:41.660> distance<00:02:42.230> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
consistency I'm just using distance to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.060 
consistency I'm just using distance to
click<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.010> next<00:02:46.390> three<00:02:47.390> flats

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
click like that on the next three flats

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.280 
click like that on the next three flats
now<00:02:49.070> faces<00:02:49.550> with<00:02:49.730> flats<00:02:50.030> as<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.140> each

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
now faces with flats as you can see each

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.580 
now faces with flats as you can see each
one<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> made<00:02:51.769> out<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.890> three<00:02:52.100> phases<00:02:52.519> now<00:02:52.730> i

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
one is made out of three phases now i

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.860 
one is made out of three phases now i
select<00:02:54.590> those<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:57.370> i<00:02:58.370> do<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.940> same<00:02:59.209> up<00:02:59.570> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
select those and i do the same up I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.199 
select those and i do the same up I
don't<00:03:00.260> want<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.769> selected<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
don't want that one selected I do the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.030 
don't want that one selected I do the
same<00:03:02.420> thing<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.900> next<00:03:03.230> three<00:03:03.440> flats<00:03:03.709> with

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
same thing on the next three flats with

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.210 
same thing on the next three flats with
staggering<00:03:04.489> with<00:03:04.670> one<00:03:04.850> face<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.269> between<00:03:06.220> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
staggering with one face in between and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.360 
staggering with one face in between and
in<00:03:07.970> sit<00:03:08.269> with<00:03:08.390> middle<00:03:08.690> mouse<00:03:08.720> button<00:03:09.370> same

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
in sit with middle mouse button same

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.140 
in sit with middle mouse button same
distance<00:03:10.940> along<00:03:11.360> edges<00:03:11.720> though<00:03:12.880> here<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.030> can

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
distance along edges though here you can

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.300 
distance along edges though here you can
see<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.720> have<00:03:15.579> control<00:03:16.579> loops<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.560> make<00:03:18.980> it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
see I have control loops that make it

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.530 
see I have control loops that make it
like<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.310> go<00:03:22.340> view<00:03:22.760> quick<00:03:23.239> smooth

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
like so if I go view quick smooth

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.690 
like so if I go view quick smooth
preview<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.320> can<00:03:24.350> see<00:03:24.739> why<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.040> control

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
preview you can see why this control

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.150 
preview you can see why this control
loops<00:03:25.880> are<00:03:26.090> important<00:03:26.540> because<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.950> get

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
loops are important because I get

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.090 
loops are important because I get
rounded<00:03:28.670> corners<00:03:29.150> but<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.019> still<00:03:30.260> have<00:03:30.709> some

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
rounded corners but I still have some

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.960 
rounded corners but I still have some
preservation<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.030> floods<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.790> am

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
preservation of the floods and I am

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.460 
preservation of the floods and I am
going<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.420> do<00:03:35.540> you

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
going to do you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.950 
going to do you
am<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.520> going<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.820> do<00:03:37.880> now<00:03:37.910> I'm<00:03:38.330> going<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.810> do<00:03:38.930> a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
am I going to do now I'm going to do a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:49.690 
am I going to do now I'm going to do a
quick<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.530> sit<00:03:42.610> smaller<00:03:45.640> yeah<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:48.700> those

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
quick and sit smaller yeah all those

00:03:49.700 --> 00:04:06.450 
quick and sit smaller yeah all those
edges<00:03:50.120> hard<00:03:53.920> dick<00:03:54.920> quads<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:58.390> and<00:04:00.940> this<00:04:01.940> side

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.780 

we<00:04:07.460> can<00:04:07.790> do<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.180> flat<00:04:08.510> bowl<00:04:08.750> like<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.640> this

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
we can do the flat bowl like so and this

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.949 
we can do the flat bowl like so and this
site<00:04:11.030> i'm<00:04:11.120> going<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.480> something<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.900> little

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
site i'm going to do something a little

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:23.440 
site i'm going to do something a little
different<00:04:14.740> to<00:04:15.740> you<00:04:19.780> slide<00:04:20.780> here<00:04:21.850> sit<00:04:22.850> out<00:04:23.090> by

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
different to you slide here sit out by

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.780 
different to you slide here sit out by
doing<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.840> I'm<00:04:24.050> hitting<00:04:24.770> G<00:04:25.010> to<00:04:25.250> select<00:04:25.670> our

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
doing that I'm hitting G to select our

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.080 
doing that I'm hitting G to select our
game<00:04:26.410> key<00:04:27.410> for<00:04:27.710> rain<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.160> see<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.520> connect<00:04:28.880> in

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
game key for rain and see to connect in

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.510

any<00:04:29.330> slide<00:04:29.630> but<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:31.669> I<00:04:31.880> added<00:04:32.180> extra<00:04:32.600> loop<00:04:33.520> set

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
any slide but so I added extra loop set

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.570 
any slide but so I added extra loop set
that<00:04:34.730> blew<00:04:35.000> hard

gonna do hi one more and connect and I
want<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.020> slide<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.770> one<00:05:31.980> up<00:05:32.190> like<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:32.700> I'm

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
want to slide that one up like so I'm

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.350 
want to slide that one up like so I'm
going<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.810> make<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.170> a<00:05:34.380> flared<00:05:34.740> met<00:05:35.070> hit<00:05:35.360> so

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
going to make this a flared met hit so

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.410 
going to make this a flared met hit so
right<00:05:36.480> now<00:05:36.510> it's<00:05:36.810> just<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:37.140> regular<00:05:37.290> heck<00:05:37.650> set<00:05:37.950> i

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
right now it's just a regular heck set i

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.780 
right now it's just a regular heck set i
am<00:05:39.420> going<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.690> flare<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.110> base<00:05:40.260> of<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.650> it's<00:05:41.640> a

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
am going to flare the base of it it's a

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.590 
am going to flare the base of it it's a
circular<00:05:42.210> base<00:05:46.220> that's<00:05:47.220> now<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.520> train<00:05:47.940> with

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
circular base that's now a train with

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.560 
circular base that's now a train with
the<00:05:48.750> g<00:05:49.020> by<00:05:49.590> picking<00:05:49.950> one<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.130> those<00:05:50.220> edges<00:05:50.610> go

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
the g by picking one of those edges go

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.710 
the g by picking one of those edges go
to<00:05:51.630> face<00:05:51.900> mood<00:05:52.370> now<00:05:53.370> i<00:05:53.430> have<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:54.030> face<00:05:54.390> loop

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
to face mood now i have a face loop

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.940 
to face mood now i have a face loop
instead<00:05:54.930> of<00:05:55.260> edging<00:05:56.250> we're<00:05:56.940> facing<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:57.690> said

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
instead of edging we're facing and said

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.840 
instead of edging we're facing and said
well<00:05:58.950> you<00:05:59.040> get<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.220> idea<00:05:59.370> now<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.390> hit<00:06:00.630> l<00:06:01.850> it's

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
well you get the idea now I hit l it's

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.120 
well you get the idea now I hit l it's
likes<00:06:03.210> both<00:06:03.480> of<00:06:03.690> those<00:06:05.000> edge<00:06:06.000> loops<00:06:07.130> anyway

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
likes both of those edge loops anyway

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.980 
likes both of those edge loops anyway
I'm<00:06:08.310> going<00:06:08.640> to<00:06:08.820> do<00:06:08.970> now<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:10.100> circular<00:06:11.100> eyes<00:06:11.990> but

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
I'm going to do now is circular eyes but

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.340 
I'm going to do now is circular eyes but
i<00:06:13.020> have<00:06:13.230> it<00:06:13.350> set<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.590> absolute<00:06:14.190> diameter<00:06:15.350> shake

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
i have it set to absolute diameter shake

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.560 
i have it set to absolute diameter shake

to you i am doing here is i'm a flare in
a<00:06:27.900> base<00:06:28.080> out<00:06:28.350> so<00:06:28.620> i<00:06:28.650> have<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:28.890> circular<00:06:29.190> flared

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
a base out so i have a circular flared

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.690 
a base out so i have a circular flared
base

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.910 

hecht<00:06:36.740> slide<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> little<00:06:37.950> bit<00:06:39.500> and<00:06:40.500> I'm<00:06:40.740> gonna

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
hecht slide a little bit and I'm gonna

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:49.740 
hecht slide a little bit and I'm gonna
make<00:06:41.010> that<00:06:41.370> hard<00:06:44.090> and

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.570 

Oh<00:06:50.400> slide<00:06:51.400> I<00:06:51.970> own<00:06:52.360> it<00:06:52.510> slightly<00:06:52.810> more<00:06:53.580> that

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
Oh slide I own it slightly more that

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.470 
Oh slide I own it slightly more that
hard

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:04.970 

and<00:06:57.990> I<00:06:58.230> can<00:06:58.500> actually<00:06:59.690> stick<00:07:00.690> quads<00:07:03.650> and<00:07:04.650> now

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
and I can actually stick quads and now

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.270 
and I can actually stick quads and now
as<00:07:05.220> you<00:07:05.400> can<00:07:05.550> see<00:07:05.610> that<00:07:06.180> is<00:07:06.360> a<00:07:06.390> bolt<00:07:06.840> head<00:07:10.280> quick

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
as you can see that is a bolt head quick

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.170 
as you can see that is a bolt head quick
smooth<00:07:11.640> preview<00:07:12.500> and<00:07:13.500> it<00:07:14.310> got<00:07:14.520> a<00:07:14.550> bolt<00:07:14.880> that

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
smooth preview and it got a bolt that

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.230 
smooth preview and it got a bolt that
could<00:07:15.360> be<00:07:15.420> a<00:07:15.450> lug<00:07:15.750> nut<00:07:15.780> or<00:07:16.200> bolt<00:07:16.940> but<00:07:17.940> it's<00:07:18.090> got

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
could be a lug nut or bolt but it's got

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.870 
could be a lug nut or bolt but it's got
a<00:07:18.270> flared<00:07:18.600> head<00:07:18.810> and<00:07:19.650> you<00:07:20.250> have<00:07:20.430> an<00:07:20.520> idea<00:07:20.820> of

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
a flared head and you have an idea of

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.250 
a flared head and you have an idea of
how<00:07:21.030> to<00:07:21.090> model<00:07:21.450> it<00:07:21.540> now<00:07:21.690> you<00:07:21.870> can<00:07:22.080> make

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
how to model it now you can make

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.010 
how to model it now you can make
different<00:07:22.560> sizes<00:07:23.190> ever<00:07:23.610> you<00:07:23.730> want<00:07:23.880> to<00:07:23.970> do<00:07:24.090> but

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
different sizes ever you want to do but

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.720 
different sizes ever you want to do but
that's<00:07:25.140> how<00:07:25.350> you<00:07:25.410> model<00:07:25.890> it<00:07:25.950> real<00:07:26.460> simple

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
that's how you model it real simple

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.030 
that's how you model it real simple
really<00:07:27.240> useful<00:07:27.690> you<00:07:28.440> can<00:07:28.470> plop<00:07:28.800> it<00:07:28.980> on

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.040 
really useful you can plop it on

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.290 
really useful you can plop it on
anything<00:07:29.370> and<00:07:31.460> it's<00:07:32.460> not<00:07:32.640> that<00:07:32.670> hard<00:07:33.120> to<00:07:33.240> me

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
anything and it's not that hard to me

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.650 
anything and it's not that hard to me
bolt<00:07:36.300> hit<00:07:36.540> their<00:07:37.350> you
