00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
pretty good but I think I'm going to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.100 
pretty good but I think I'm going to
start<00:01:54.910> I'm<00:01:55.120> going<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.330> redo<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.720> carpet

start I'm going to redo the carpet
pretty<00:01:56.350> soon<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.830> kind<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.190> give<00:01:57.729> a

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
pretty soon just to kind of give a

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.960 
pretty soon just to kind of give a
little<00:01:57.940> more<00:01:58.150> life<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:59.110> then<00:01:59.380> actually<00:01:59.970> you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
little more life and then actually you

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.940 
little more life and then actually you
can<00:02:01.600> see<00:02:01.720> there's<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.900> little<00:02:02.020> where<00:02:02.320> here<00:02:02.770> on

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
can see there's a little where here on

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.700 
can see there's a little where here on
this<00:02:03.550> seat<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.930> think<00:02:05.110> what<00:02:05.229> I'll<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.500> is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
this seat and I think what I'll do is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.600 
this seat and I think what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:06.130> go<00:02:06.280> ahead<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:06.850> redo<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> leather

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I'll go ahead and just redo the leather

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.460 
I'll go ahead and just redo the leather
when<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> go<00:02:09.850> ahead<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.209> I'll<00:02:10.840> do<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.110> carpet

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
when I go ahead and I'll do the carpet

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.770 
when I go ahead and I'll do the carpet
first<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.980> then<00:02:12.100> I'll<00:02:12.220> redo<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> leather<00:02:15.780> so

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
first and then I'll redo the leather so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.760 
first and then I'll redo the leather so
get<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> shot<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.800> motor<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:23.470> is

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
get a shot of the motor for you that is

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.890 
get a shot of the motor for you that is
the<00:02:23.980> motor<00:02:24.220> there<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:27.300> well<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.360> think<00:02:28.600> that's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the motor there so well I think that's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.500 
the motor there so well I think that's
it<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.160> my<00:02:30.660> 1983<00:02:31.660> 500<00:02:32.350> SL<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.299> been

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
it this is my 1983 500 SL it's just been

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.800 
it this is my 1983 500 SL it's just been
a<00:02:34.540> dream<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.380> own<00:02:36.150> once<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.269> get<00:02:37.420> all<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.630> bugs

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
a dream to own once you get all the bugs

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.590 
a dream to own once you get all the bugs
out<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.799> really<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> good<00:02:39.730> car<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.450> use

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
out it really is a good car you can use

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.259 
out it really is a good car you can use
this<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> daily<00:02:41.170> driver<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.730> only<00:02:42.910> thing<00:02:43.090> is

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
this as a daily driver the only thing is

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.360 
this as a daily driver the only thing is
you<00:02:43.959> kind<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.320> have<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.830> go<00:02:45.100> through

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you kind of have to really go through

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.670 
you kind of have to really go through
them<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.580> order<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.360> these<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.560> know

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
them in order to do that these you know

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.440 
them in order to do that these you know
in<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.130> engine<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.000> most<00:02:49.209> part

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
in the engine here for the most part

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390 
in the engine here for the most part
most<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> vacuum<00:02:50.709> valves<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:51.250> been

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
most of the vacuum valves have been

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.130 
most of the vacuum valves have been
Repub<00:02:51.760> backing<00:02:52.209> lines<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:52.600> been<00:02:52.750> replaced

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
Repub backing lines have been replaced

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.250 
Repub backing lines have been replaced
and<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.950> rubber<00:02:54.160> tubing<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.750> stuck<00:02:56.049> it's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
and the rubber tubing that stuck it's

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.199 
and the rubber tubing that stuck it's
old<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.830> brittle<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.190> look<00:02:57.549> at<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.970> breaks

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
old and brittle you look at it it breaks

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.990 
old and brittle you look at it it breaks
I<00:02:58.660> actually<00:02:59.440> just<00:02:59.950> did<00:03:00.220> have<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.489> problem<00:03:00.910> with

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
I actually just did have a problem with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.479 
I actually just did have a problem with
the<00:03:01.090> mono<00:03:01.299> valve<00:03:01.630> over<00:03:02.019> here<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.370> can

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
the mono valve over here and as you can

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.910 
the mono valve over here and as you can
see<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:04.660> model<00:03:04.870> valves<00:03:05.350> actually<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> little

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
see this model valves actually a little

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.150 
see this model valves actually a little
different<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:08.230> has<00:03:08.290> dual<00:03:08.890> climate

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
different because it has dual climate

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.199 
different because it has dual climate
control<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:11.709> have<00:03:12.430> climate<00:03:12.970> for<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
control so I have climate for the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.590 
control so I have climate for the
passenger<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> driver<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.480> what<00:03:16.480> had

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
passenger and the driver and what had

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.110 
passenger and the driver and what had
happened<00:03:17.049> actually<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.070> mono<00:03:18.580> valve<00:03:18.880> didn't

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
happened actually the mono valve didn't

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.780 
happened actually the mono valve didn't
go<00:03:19.269> bad<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.989> coil<00:03:20.350> actually<00:03:20.860> came<00:03:21.160> be

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
go bad the coil actually came be

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.660 
go bad the coil actually came be
soldered<00:03:22.530> off<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.250> had<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.519> go

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
soldered off of that so I had to go

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.190 
soldered off of that so I had to go
ahead<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.940> restore<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.630> but<00:03:25.870> everything's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
ahead and restore that but everything's

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.259 
ahead and restore that but everything's
working<00:03:26.560> good<00:03:26.920> enough<00:03:27.250> now<00:03:27.489> but<00:03:27.519> as<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.120> can

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
working good enough now but as you can

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.960 
working good enough now but as you can
see<00:03:28.540> there<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.799> dual<00:03:30.040> climate<00:03:30.370> control

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
see there is the dual climate control

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.140 
see there is the dual climate control
this<00:03:31.480> cars<00:03:31.720> an<00:03:31.870> 83<00:03:32.530> with<00:03:33.100> dual<00:03:33.310> climate<00:03:33.550> and<00:03:34.030> it

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
this cars an 83 with dual climate and it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.580 
this cars an 83 with dual climate and it
has<00:03:34.300> ABS<00:03:34.750> brakes<00:03:35.200> on<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.560> as<00:03:35.680> well<00:03:35.890> too

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
has ABS brakes on it as well too

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.619 
has ABS brakes on it as well too
80<00:03:36.890> floors<00:03:37.190> did<00:03:37.550> have<00:03:37.700> airbags<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.420> them<00:03:38.510> but

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
80 floors did have airbags on them but

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.440 
80 floors did have airbags on them but
this<00:03:38.810> one<00:03:38.989> doesn't<00:03:39.340> anyway<00:03:40.340> have<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.090> nice<00:03:41.209> day

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
this one doesn't anyway have a nice day

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.480 
this one doesn't anyway have a nice day
now
