00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:11.299
 in this video I 'm going to show you a way 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.910
 different from drawing a pentagon 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.350
 regular inscribed in a circle 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.350
 known the circumference 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.160
 first of all we will draw 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.960
 conference 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.460
 that will circumscribe our pentagon 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.230
 storm or 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 OK 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 in this circle we are going to draw 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.250
 a parallel the perpendicular challenges 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 is 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.989
 Yes Yes 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.530
 after forms eliminate the other 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.059
 method 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.059
 I am going to draw 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.390
 the sad half 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.070
 well half of the radius I'm going to mark 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.570
 purely from the radio for which I have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.570
 to draw the average 3 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.580
 It would be the half trize and stage 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.509
 with this point that ended already 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.550
 and drawing 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.810
 and with this point that I just found and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.810
 the point below 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.220
 and better 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.550
 once 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.409
 and this point here is the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.060
 circumference is the tangent 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.390
 of the circumference that I will be 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 closing 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.960
 Well these two points are already 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.800
 part 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 of the trousers 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.050
 and if I open a little more the compass 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140
 in this point 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.390
 as well 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.000
 which it's 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.150
 we thought it was next 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150
 love 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.590
 and you 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.120
 of those solutions 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.069
 from the alternative form to the other video 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.019
 What have I done 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.019
 to draw a pentagon like
