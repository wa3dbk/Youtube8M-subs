running<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:40.170> Tyler<00:01:40.530> gym<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
running and now Tyler gym is going to be

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
running and now Tyler gym is going to be
very<00:01:41.460> very<00:01:41.640> far<00:01:41.880> behind<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
very very far behind you can see now a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.080 
very very far behind you can see now a
pylon<00:01:43.350> being<00:01:43.560> built<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:44.430> home<00:01:44.759> it's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
pylon being built back at home it's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
pylon being built back at home it's
gonna<00:01:45.840> chrono<00:01:46.200> boost<00:01:46.470> out<00:01:46.649> probes<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
gonna chrono boost out probes the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
gonna chrono boost out probes the
gateway<00:01:48.060> m<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.780> he<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.290> let<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
gateway m is he going to actually let it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
gateway m is he going to actually let it
complete<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> key<00:01:50.790> key<00:01:51.030> question<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.780> he

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
complete is a key key question there he

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.569 
complete is a key key question there he
probably<00:01:52.470> shouldn't<00:01:52.829> even<00:01:53.009> let<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> complete

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
probably shouldn't even let it complete

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.700 
probably shouldn't even let it complete
only<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.180> SUVs<00:01:54.659> enough<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> stop<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.649> now

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
only for SUVs enough to stop it and now

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.880 
only for SUVs enough to stop it and now
in<00:01:55.950> comes<00:01:56.250> another<00:01:56.670> gateway<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.229> canceling<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in comes another gateway so canceling it

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.410 
in comes another gateway so canceling it
and<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.130> rebuilding<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> murine<00:02:00.210> now

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and then rebuilding in a murine now

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
and then rebuilding in a murine now
going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.750> trained<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.590> well<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.549> what

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
going to be trained up as well so what

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to be trained up as well so what
can<00:02:02.880> happen<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> marine<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
can happen here is a marine can just

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.039 
can happen here is a marine can just
simply<00:02:05.159> come<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.640> start<00:02:06.299> attacking<00:02:06.750> or

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
simply come out start attacking or

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
simply come out start attacking or
perhaps<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.530> after<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.220> probe<00:02:08.520> perhaps

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
perhaps go after this one probe perhaps

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
perhaps go after this one probe perhaps
even<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.629> take<00:02:09.840> down<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> pylon<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
even just take down the pylon as the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
even just take down the pylon as the
pylon<00:02:11.790> should<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.120> enough<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.450> now<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> marine

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
pylon should be enough as now a marine

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.710 
pylon should be enough as now a marine
it's<00:02:13.710> way<00:02:13.830> over<00:02:14.070> one<00:02:14.310> marine<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:15.120> started

it's way over one marine just started
shooting<00:02:15.840> away<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.470> see<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.740> probe

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
shooting away you can see that the probe

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.010 
shooting away you can see that the probe
still<00:02:17.220> coming<00:02:17.550> back<00:02:17.700> around<00:02:17.910> another<00:02:18.720> supply

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.880 
people is being built as a more SUVs are
still<00:02:21.720> making<00:02:22.050> their<00:02:22.140> way<00:02:22.200> over<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.560> Marines

dps<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.730> faster<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:25.080> still<00:02:25.350> needs<00:02:25.680> at<00:02:25.830> least

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
dps is faster but still needs at least

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.310 
dps is faster but still needs at least
two<00:02:26.070> SUVs<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.940> order<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.360> shut<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:27.960> this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
two SUVs in order to shut down this

out<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.209> moment<00:02:30.510> there<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.260> believe

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
out in just a moment there and I believe

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.740 
out in just a moment there and I believe
this<00:02:31.740> gateway<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.910> pylon<00:02:33.330> are<00:02:33.510> pretty

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
this gateway and this pylon are pretty

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.260 
this gateway and this pylon are pretty
much<00:02:33.959> done<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.680> as<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:35.580> Marines<00:02:35.910> are<00:02:36.030> still

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
much done for as more Marines are still

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.730 
much done for as more Marines are still
being<00:02:36.420> added<00:02:36.690> where<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.990> Marines<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.410> why

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
being added where the Marines going why

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.650 
being added where the Marines going why
the<00:02:37.800> Marines<00:02:38.160> not<00:02:38.400> taking<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.030> perhaps

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the Marines not taking this down perhaps

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.540 
the Marines not taking this down perhaps
going<00:02:39.870> after<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> probe<00:02:40.530> instead<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.250> probe

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
going after the probe instead the probe

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.610 
going after the probe instead the probe
the<00:02:41.940> Gateway<00:02:42.270> has<00:02:42.300> been<00:02:42.750> cancelled<00:02:43.200> once<00:02:43.410> more

here<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.750> looked<00:02:46.050> at<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> Marines<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.500> gonna

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
here it looked at the Marines are gonna

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.960 
here it looked at the Marines are gonna
be<00:02:46.739> able<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.070> some<00:02:47.220> shots<00:02:47.520> off<00:02:47.730> pretty

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
be able to get some shots off pretty

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
be able to get some shots off pretty
easily<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.420> Marines<00:02:48.840> already<00:02:49.260> ready<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
easily a Marines already ready and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.310 
easily a Marines already ready and
waiting<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:50.970> over<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> Down<00:02:52.290> Goes

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
waiting down over here and Down Goes

waiting down over here and Down Goes
that<00:02:52.800> probe<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.550> pylon<00:02:53.910> will<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:54.300> taken

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
that probe and this pylon will get taken

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660 
that probe and this pylon will get taken
down<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:54.989> well<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.160> now<00:02:56.340> more

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
down as well we can see now more

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610 
down as well we can see now more
gateways<00:02:56.970> being<00:02:57.390> built<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.750> behind<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
gateways being built right behind it and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.820 
gateways being built right behind it and
we<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.610> be<00:02:59.670> getting<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.000> zealot<00:03:00.510> now

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
we are going to be getting a zealot now

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.050 
we are going to be getting a zealot now
so<00:03:01.830> let's<00:03:01.980> sell<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.370> perhaps<00:03:02.580> they<00:03:02.850> try<00:03:03.000> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so let's sell it perhaps they try to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.610 
so let's sell it perhaps they try to
counteract<00:03:03.480> any<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.870> those<00:03:03.959> Marines<00:03:04.320> these

the losses abnormally large but you got

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.490 
the losses abnormally large but you got
to<00:03:09.120> remember<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.690> when<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> building<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500

to remember that when a building is
cancelled<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.640> full<00:03:11.940> losses<00:03:12.420> are<00:03:12.630> shown<00:03:13.020> not

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
cancelled the full losses are shown not

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.890 
cancelled the full losses are shown not
the<00:03:14.040> actual<00:03:14.340> refunded<00:03:15.000> losses<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.720> not

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the actual refunded losses so it is not

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.080 
the actual refunded losses so it is not
really<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> far<00:03:16.860> behind<00:03:17.040> unless<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.910> take<00:03:18.060> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
really that far behind unless you take a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.979 
really that far behind unless you take a
look<00:03:18.239> at<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.390> harvesters<00:03:18.810> 21<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.620> 18<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.430> 18<00:03:20.989> 18

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
look at the harvesters 21 to 18 so 18 18

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.870 
look at the harvesters 21 to 18 so 18 18

harvesters coming in as we now see what

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.070

is this probe doing perhaps

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.550 
is this probe doing perhaps

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
transitioning into a proxy Stargate so

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.850
