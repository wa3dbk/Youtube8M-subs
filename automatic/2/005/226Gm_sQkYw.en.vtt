00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
like to go down the sides of the nails

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.070 
like to go down the sides of the nails
this<00:00:39.550> just<00:00:39.790> keeps<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.180> really<00:00:40.480> really<00:00:40.900> neat

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
this just keeps it really really neat

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.250 
this just keeps it really really neat
and<00:00:41.350> gives<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.370> professional<00:00:43.330> look<00:00:43.510> so

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
and gives it that professional look so

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.130 
and gives it that professional look so
once<00:00:44.530> I've<00:00:44.770> done<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.040> I<00:00:45.580> like<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.450> then<00:00:46.630> shape

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
once I've done that I like to then shape

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.980 
once I've done that I like to then shape
mine<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.920> square<00:00:48.400> oval<00:00:48.910> shape<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:49.840> they're

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
mine in a square oval shape so they're

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.470 
mine in a square oval shape so they're
quite<00:00:50.140> square<00:00:50.860> at<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.070> tip<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.610> then<00:00:52.240> they're

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
quite square at the tip and then they're

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.870 
quite square at the tip and then they're
rounded<00:00:52.930> off<00:00:53.080> at<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.560> corner<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.580> means

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
rounded off at the corner and that means

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.400 
rounded off at the corner and that means
for<00:00:55.180> me<00:00:55.330> that<00:00:55.540> they<00:00:55.690> don't<00:00:55.810> catch<00:00:56.110> on<00:00:56.380> anything

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
for me that they don't catch on anything

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.340 
for me that they don't catch on anything
and<00:00:57.070> they're<00:00:57.400> less<00:00:57.640> likely<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:58.150> rip<00:00:58.600> which<00:00:59.140> is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
and they're less likely to rip which is

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.900 
and they're less likely to rip which is
always<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.829> pain<00:01:00.160> when<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.490> grow<00:01:00.700> on<00:01:00.760> your

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
always a pain when you grow on your

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.120 
always a pain when you grow on your
nails<00:01:01.090> so<00:01:01.720> for<00:01:01.900> me<00:01:02.020> this<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.230> probably<00:01:02.500> one<00:01:03.100> of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
nails so for me this is probably one of

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.009 
nails so for me this is probably one of
the<00:01:03.280> most<00:01:03.460> important<00:01:04.059> steps<00:01:04.329> in<00:01:04.540> getting<00:01:04.930> that

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
the most important steps in getting that

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.440 
the most important steps in getting that
professional<00:01:05.650> finish<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.369> nail<00:01:06.549> so<00:01:07.329> if

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
professional finish to the nail so if

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.480

you<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.930> have<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.170> really<00:01:08.650> smooth<00:01:09.040> like

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
and it looks bumpy and uneven then this

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.080 
and it looks bumpy and uneven then this
is<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> necessary<00:01:16.840> step<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.710> get<00:01:18.429> lots<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.759> ridges

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090

really smooth and it does this in

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.330 
really smooth and it does this in
seconds<00:01:45.789> so<00:01:46.299> it<00:01:46.420> saves<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:46.959> with<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.469> manual

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
seconds so it saves you with that manual

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.819 
seconds so it saves you with that manual
buffer<00:01:48.819> you<00:01:49.149> know<00:01:49.270> go<00:01:49.959> on<00:01:50.049> eye<00:01:50.139> out<00:01:50.289> for<00:01:50.319> ages

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
buffer you know go on eye out for ages

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.160 
buffer you know go on eye out for ages
you<00:01:50.979> do<00:01:51.249> this<00:01:51.429> for<00:01:51.609> two<00:01:51.789> seconds<00:01:52.299> per<00:01:52.600> nail<00:01:52.899> and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
you do this for two seconds per nail and

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.679 
you do this for two seconds per nail and
it's<00:01:53.619> smooth<00:01:54.039> as<00:01:54.279> a<00:01:54.310> baby's<00:01:54.789> bottom<00:01:55.149> so<00:01:55.569> it's

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
it's smooth as a baby's bottom so it's

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.269 
it's smooth as a baby's bottom so it's
very<00:01:55.840> easy<00:01:55.959> to<00:01:56.259> use<00:01:56.380> I'm<00:01:56.829> just<00:01:56.979> going<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.159> show

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
very easy to use I'm just going to show

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:58.830 
very easy to use I'm just going to show
you<00:01:57.340> quickly<00:01:57.700> how<00:01:57.999> to<00:01:58.029> start<00:01:58.450> off<00:01:58.569> with<00:01:58.719> this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
you quickly how to start off with this

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.809 
you quickly how to start off with this
so<00:01:59.319> first<00:01:59.499> of<00:01:59.709> all<00:01:59.799> it<00:02:00.039> has<00:02:00.189> the<00:02:00.429> on/off<00:02:00.639> switch

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
so first of all it has the on/off switch

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.839 
so first of all it has the on/off switch
and<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:02.079> has<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.409> cup<00:02:02.649> which<00:02:02.950> comes<00:02:03.249> off<00:02:03.429> very

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
and it has the cup which comes off very

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.760 
and it has the cup which comes off very
easily<00:02:04.119> now<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.049> doesn't<00:02:05.349> work<00:02:05.499> because

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
easily now it doesn't work because

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.919 
easily now it doesn't work because
there's<00:02:06.249> no<00:02:06.429> batteries<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:07.599> to<00:02:07.659> put

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
there's no batteries in it so to put

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.839 
there's no batteries in it so to put
batteries<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:09.160> press<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.610> unlock

off then inside you can put the
batteries<00:02:16.090> in

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
batteries in

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.770 
batteries in
I<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.140> two<00:02:17.319> batteries<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.569> they<00:02:19.569> go

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
I get two batteries with it and they go

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.430 
I get two batteries with it and they go
in<00:02:20.050> different<00:02:20.260> ways<00:02:20.800> each<00:02:21.370> side<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.660> make<00:02:23.260> sure

in different ways each side so make sure
you<00:02:23.530> look<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.980> plus<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.459> minus<00:02:24.849> sign<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
you look for the plus and minus sign and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.620 
you look for the plus and minus sign and
then<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.709> pop<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.250> batteries<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:30.360> do<00:02:31.360> make

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
then just pop the batteries in do make

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.970 
then just pop the batteries in do make
sure<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> off<00:02:32.739> position

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
before you put the batteries in there

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.330 
simply take it off and put the white one
on<00:03:38.340> because<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.660> time<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.410> shine<00:03:40.650> so

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
on because now it is time to shine so

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
on because now it is time to shine so
we're<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.580> do<00:03:41.700> exactly<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.360> same<00:03:42.630> as<00:03:42.900> we

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
we're going to do exactly the same as we

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.110 
we're going to do exactly the same as we
did<00:03:43.230> before<00:03:43.380> remember<00:03:44.130> about<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.580> seconds

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
did before remember about two seconds

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.330 
did before remember about two seconds
per<00:03:45.390> Neil<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.990> you're<00:03:46.650> going<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.830> see<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.190> go

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
per Neil and you're going to see it go

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.850 
per Neil and you're going to see it go
from<00:03:47.370> quite<00:03:47.880> dull<00:03:48.210> as<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.900> now<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.500> really

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
from quite dull as it is now to really

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:04.410 
from quite dull as it is now to really
shiny

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.720 

so<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.650> what<00:04:05.800> I<00:04:05.830> wanted<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.220> show<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.430> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
so this is what I wanted to show you the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.640 
so this is what I wanted to show you the
difference<00:04:07.240> between<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.810> hands<00:04:08.200> this<00:04:08.440> one

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
difference between the hands this one

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.559 
difference between the hands this one
obviously<00:04:08.890> has<00:04:09.310> been<00:04:09.340> dirt<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:10.060> one<00:04:10.300> hasn't

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
obviously has been dirt this one hasn't

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.090 
obviously has been dirt this one hasn't
and<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.020> can<00:04:11.170> see<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.680> difference

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and you can see the difference

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.160 
and you can see the difference
immediately<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:13.330> almost<00:04:13.569> looks<00:04:13.900> like<00:04:13.959> I've

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
immediately it almost looks like I've

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.960 
immediately it almost looks like I've
got<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.350> topcoat<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.250> way<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.550> light<00:04:15.730> just

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
got a topcoat on the way the light just

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.360 
got a topcoat on the way the light just
bounces<00:04:16.480> around<00:04:16.600> there<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:17.829> what<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.310> to

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
bounces around there so what I like to

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.550 
bounces around there so what I like to
do<00:04:18.670> if<00:04:18.940> I'm<00:04:19.090> not<00:04:19.209> applying<00:04:19.540> nail<00:04:19.750> polish<00:04:20.140> is<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
do if I'm not applying nail polish is to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.830 
do if I'm not applying nail polish is to
just<00:04:20.799> take<00:04:21.040> some<00:04:21.280> oil<00:04:21.459> I'm<00:04:21.790> just<00:04:22.450> going<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.630> use

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
just take some oil I'm just going to use

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.100 
just take some oil I'm just going to use
this<00:04:23.110> quarterly<00:04:23.680> oil<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.370> place<00:04:25.150> this<00:04:25.480> around

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
this quarterly oil and place this around

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.950 
this quarterly oil and place this around
my<00:04:26.440> nail<00:04:26.650> or<00:04:26.980> on<00:04:27.160> my<00:04:27.340> nail<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:28.060> round<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
my nail or on my nail and a round on the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.170 
my nail or on my nail and a round on the
cuticle<00:04:29.230> just<00:04:30.160> on<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.490> sides<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.940> nails

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
cuticle just on the sides of the nails

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.150 
cuticle just on the sides of the nails
as<00:04:31.360> well<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:32.140> just<00:04:32.410> keeps<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:32.830> really

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
as well this just keeps it really

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.630 
as well this just keeps it really
hydrated<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.210> lot<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.840> peeling<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.680> snappin<00:04:36.430> is

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
hydrated a lot of peeling and snappin is

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.550 
hydrated a lot of peeling and snappin is
caused<00:04:36.970> because<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.540> nails<00:04:37.720> dry<00:04:38.169> and<00:04:38.410> brittle

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
caused because the nails dry and brittle

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.890 
caused because the nails dry and brittle
so<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.310> just<00:04:39.460> need<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.669> keep<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.120> hydrated

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
so you just need to keep that hydrated

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.310 
so you just need to keep that hydrated
with<00:04:41.200> oils<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.040> cuticle<00:04:42.550> creams<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:44.080> just

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
with oils and cuticle creams and it just

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.409 
with oils and cuticle creams and it just
keeps<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.740> nail<00:04:44.890> really<00:04:45.250> strong<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.060> healthy

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
keeps the nail really strong and healthy

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.510 
keeps the nail really strong and healthy
so<00:04:47.260> if<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:47.560> want<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.770> ply<00:04:47.950> nail<00:04:48.190> polish

so if you do want to ply nail polish

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.450 
so if you do want to ply nail polish
then<00:04:48.730> don't<00:04:49.120> use<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.750> oil<00:04:49.780> just<00:04:50.290> yet<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.830> I
