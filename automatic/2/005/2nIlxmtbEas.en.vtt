00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.670
 delicious dessert let's make a flan 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.130
 of chocolate that we will accompany with 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.110
 seasonal fruit this dessert is going to 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.110
 Do the delight of the whole family 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.550
 to prepare our plan we already have 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.210
 here the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.610
 need 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 We are going to use liquid candy that 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.560
 we can buy it ready or do it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.290
 ourselves to your liking we are going to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 need 600 milliliters of milk to be 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.040
 possible whole 5 eggs of which 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.129
 We will use 3 whole eggs and 2 yolks 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 Let it be the big size 150 grams of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.370
 chocolate this coverage has a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.320
 70% cocoa and 180 grams of sugar and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 then the fruit that everyone wants 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.350
 I in this case have chosen a bit of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.809
 I have all chosen peach paraguay or 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.200
 traditional peach cherries 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.590
 how many strawberries plums kiwis a little bit 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.590
 of everything 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.330
 The first thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.550
 a mold east flan 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 like all puddings can be done in 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.070
 an individual mold or in a different mold 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 of tiny molds for each for each 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.420
 person or in a big mold I have 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.430
 chosen a big mold to take it out to 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.140
 the table accompanied by the fruit that 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.080
 it looks like it will be much nicer 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.350
 we 're going to caramelize it well for all its 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.710
 surface and we will leave it reserved 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.710
 aside 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.159
 with the help of a brush I will go 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.340
 providing the walls of our 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.530
 mold although it will go down a bit but 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 it's always interesting that it's okay 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 So it's going to be dismantled with more 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.250
 easy facility well let's put a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.880
 saucepan on the fire or pan in which 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 let's put the milk all the milk 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.740
 we add the milk 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 half the sugar approximately 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.280
 neither do you need to weigh the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.530
 and all the chocolate we will put 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.170
 slow fire so that it is warming up 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.170
 and the chocolate melts 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.090
 stir to mix the sugar a little 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.489
 with chocolate and milk and we're going to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.349
 leave stirring often so that 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.599
 avoid that we are not going to stick the 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.780
 chocolate in the background and meanwhile 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.340
 let's prepare the eggs we're going to 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.340
 put 3 whole eggs 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 and we are going to separate 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.020
 the whites of the yolks is clear 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.020
 we will use for other preparation 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.189
 we are going to beat it 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.750
 with the rest of the sugar and the rods and 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.750
 we will be beating until it comes out 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.000
 some foam that are foamy 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 without haste and not take your eyes off 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.860
 to milk with chocolate 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.159
 mix and milk chocolate 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.680
 I have prepared nothing else that has broken 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.299
 I've boiled it away from the fire and I'm going 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.790
 to let the temperature lower during 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.340
 a few minutes stirring when in 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 while in the meantime I've been beating 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.379
 the eggs as has been said so that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.049
 take volume foaming without hurry 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.239
 and here little by little you get this 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.400
 octopus I have also put to preheat the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.560
 180 degree oven with a tray 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.940
 inside with water because we're going to bake 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.940
 our plan for a bain-marie 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.860
 Well, it has already cooled a few minutes 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.560
 of milk for chocolate and I already have 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.500
 the frothy egg mixture we are going to 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.080
 go putting a hunt 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.520
 to the mixture and beating quickly to 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.520
 that does not set in our eggs 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.550
 ah 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.550
 and we continue to do it little by little 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.810
 I already have the mixture well incorporated and 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.310
 let's see it in our mold 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.310
 and we'll put it to bake 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.540
 I already have the preheated oven and we're going to 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.490
 Bake our flan for 45 to 50 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.220
 minutes we will always check pricking 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.240
 with a skewer needle or a toothpick and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.970
 to bain-marie accord to 180 degrees 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.940
 good friends we already take our flan 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.740
 of the oven let it cool at room temperature 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.530
 environment then I passed it to the fridge and what 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.979
 I have disassembled and as I said I have cut 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.080
 the fruit fruit varied and I have arranged 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.080
 to decorate it a little and to serve it and 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.840
 that we find the fresh fruit that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.539
 it is delicious it has been very cool 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.569
 and it's delicious to try it 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.569
 love 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.939
