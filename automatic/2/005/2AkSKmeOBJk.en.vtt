and<00:02:00.689> chrominance<00:02:01.459> I'm<00:02:02.459> gonna<00:02:02.670> turn<00:02:03.359> off<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and chrominance I'm gonna turn off the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.739 
and chrominance I'm gonna turn off the
opacity<00:02:04.289> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> luminance<00:02:05.189> channel<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.850> I'm

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
opacity on the luminance channel and I'm

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.619 
opacity on the luminance channel and I'm
gonna<00:02:06.869> set<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.229> blending<00:02:07.649> mode<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:09.509> darken

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
gonna set the blending mode to darken

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.000 
gonna set the blending mode to darken
now<00:02:12.629> even<00:02:13.290> though<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.470> might<00:02:13.590> seem<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.830> little

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
now even though that might seem a little

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.619 
now even though that might seem a little
counterintuitive<00:02:14.430> by<00:02:15.000> setting<00:02:15.269> this<00:02:15.390> mode<00:02:15.599> to

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
counterintuitive by setting this mode to

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.820 
counterintuitive by setting this mode to
darken<00:02:15.959> I'm

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
darken I'm

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.860 
darken I'm
only<00:02:16.980> putting<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:18.150> yellow<00:02:18.570> color

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
only putting in this this yellow color

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.080 
only putting in this this yellow color
in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.680> highlights<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> be

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
in the highlights so that's going to be

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.170 
in the highlights so that's going to be
our<00:02:21.270> paper<00:02:21.570> toning<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.520> want<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
our paper toning and now if I want to I

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.020 
our paper toning and now if I want to I
can<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.780> dial<00:02:25.020> back<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.430> opacity<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.760> little

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
can just dial back the opacity a little

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.870 
can just dial back the opacity a little
bit<00:02:27.180> somewhere<00:02:28.020> around<00:02:28.140> 5060<00:02:28.890> percent<00:02:29.100> get

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
bit somewhere around 5060 percent get

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.470 
bit somewhere around 5060 percent get
that<00:02:30.060> yellow<00:02:30.450> paper<00:02:30.780> color<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.820> next<00:02:33.150> step<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that yellow paper color the next step is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.110 
that yellow paper color the next step is
to<00:02:33.570> add<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.930> silver<00:02:34.440> tone<00:02:34.800> color<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:36.000> do

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
to add the silver tone color and to do

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.180 
to add the silver tone color and to do
that<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.330> need<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.600> go<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.290> menu<00:02:37.650> bar<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that I need to go up to the menu bar and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.950 
that I need to go up to the menu bar and
hold<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.550> shift<00:02:38.760> key<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.510> my<00:02:39.720> keyboard

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
exact same thing as we did before I'm

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.980

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
to set the L value the luminance value

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.460 
to set the L value the luminance value
to<00:03:15.959> 70<00:03:17.390> I'm<00:03:18.390> gonna<00:03:18.540> click<00:03:18.840> OK<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:21.290> again<00:03:22.290> I'm

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
going to go and expand my opacity mixer

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.380 
going to go and expand my opacity mixer
and<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.590> time<00:03:26.000> again<00:03:27.000> I'm<00:03:27.120> going<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.269> do

and this time again I'm going to do

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.150 
and this time again I'm going to do
luminance<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.930> chrominance<00:03:28.080> at<00:03:28.680> luminance

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
to zero and now this time I'm going to

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.949 
to zero and now this time I'm going to
set<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> blending<00:03:32.459> mode<00:03:32.519> instead<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.390> darken

I'm going to choose lighten and then

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.690 
I'm going to choose lighten and then
dial<00:03:37.920> back<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:39.540> opacity<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.220> now<00:03:44.400> what<00:03:44.580> you

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
dial back on the opacity so now what you

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
dial back on the opacity so now what you
can<00:03:44.820> see<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.390> I've<00:03:45.780> got<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.390> light<00:03:48.390> tones

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
can see is I've got the the light tones

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.990 
can see is I've got the the light tones
colored<00:03:49.320> in<00:03:49.470> kind<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.830> yellow<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.250> I've<00:03:50.760> got

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.660 
colored in kind of yellow and I've got
the<00:03:51.269> dark<00:03:51.720> tones<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.739> bluish<00:03:53.280> purple

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
the dark tones in this bluish purple
