00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.680
 mice in gta san andreas and how it is from and 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.000
 how to get rid of it for a start 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 go to the folder with the game 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.360
 looking for a label from gta san andreas here it is well 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.100
 I have it right click on it 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.710
 click and click properties now 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.619
 go to the compatibility tab here we are 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.600
 set to run the program in mode 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.100
 compatibility with your operating 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.659
 I have a system of windows 7 and choose 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.659
 disable visual appearance 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.140

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.340

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.440
 buggy mouse 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.900
 when I entered the game I was even afraid 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.810
 press escape because after that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.570
