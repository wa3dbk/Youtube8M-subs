00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
old white which is a really versatile

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
old white which is a really versatile
color<00:00:52.250> it's<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.430> combination<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.300> white<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
cream so it's not one or the other so it

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:59.689

a<00:01:02.879> small<00:01:03.539> thin<00:01:04.350> nylon<00:01:04.860> brush<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.720> want

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
see the difference the thick brush is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.730 
see the difference the thick brush is
going<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.290> pick<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:14.040> too<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.430> paint<00:01:14.760> and

so when you're painting in the cracks
and<00:01:18.690> crevices<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:19.800> want<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> lot

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
application so to start painting the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.560 
you're going to want to go in little
small<00:01:41.520> circular<00:01:42.330> motions

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.860 

and<00:01:45.720> again<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.760> a<00:01:47.940> lot<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.540> paint

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
Kane the paint will get in between all

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.280 
Kane the paint will get in between all
of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.750> woven<00:01:55.110> pieces<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:57.660> really<00:01:58.020> want

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
of the woven pieces so you really want

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.010 
of the woven pieces so you really want
to<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.530> sure<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.280> your<00:02:00.180> brush<00:02:00.480> is<00:02:00.750> not

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to make sure that your brush is not

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.460 
to make sure that your brush is not
covered<00:02:01.560> very<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.720> not<00:02:03.720> only<00:02:03.990> are<00:02:04.320> you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
covered very well and not only are you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.980 
covered very well and not only are you
going<00:02:04.650> over<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.160> front<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> also<00:02:06.600> want

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
going over the front but you also want

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.530 
going over the front but you also want
to<00:02:07.050> reach<00:02:07.230> around<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.650> back<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:11.300> get<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to reach around the back and get the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.230 
to reach around the back and get the
areas<00:02:12.960> where<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.740> paint<00:02:14.070> will<00:02:14.490> push<00:02:14.880> through

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
areas where the paint will push through

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.320 
areas where the paint will push through
a<00:02:15.360> little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.380> other<00:02:16.560> side<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.940> just

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
a little bit on the other side so just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.050 
a little bit on the other side so just
like<00:02:18.600> when<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.350> your<00:02:19.590> paint<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.220> you're

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
