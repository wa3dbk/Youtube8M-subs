weak<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.090> South<00:04:03.300> border<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.140> it's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
weak in the South border I think it's

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.530 
weak in the South border I think it's
this<00:04:04.650> line<00:04:05.010> here<00:04:05.489> because<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.120> feel<00:04:06.360> it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
this line here because if you feel it

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.199 
this line here because if you feel it
it's<00:04:06.750> vibrating<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.319> little<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:08.069> we<00:04:08.610> think<00:04:09.060> it

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
it's vibrating a little but we think it

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.750 
it's vibrating a little but we think it
might<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.780> line<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:11.040> we're<00:04:11.550> not<00:04:11.580> sure<00:04:11.940> um

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
might be this line but we're not sure um

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.310 
might be this line but we're not sure um
it's<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:14.850> those<00:04:15.090> over<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.139> might

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
it's really those over to do it might

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.830 
it's really those over to do it might
possibly<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:17.160> just<00:04:17.489> simply<00:04:17.820> because<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.570> all

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
