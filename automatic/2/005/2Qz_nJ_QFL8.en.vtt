down<00:01:56.670> cool<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.060> motion<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.509> was<00:01:58.630> just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
down cool so that motion I was just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.449 
down cool so that motion I was just

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
doing with my back foot that's the

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:01.800 
doing with my back foot that's the
motion<00:02:00.610> you're<00:02:00.880> going<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.209> for<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.539> shove

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
motion you're going to do for the shove

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.959 
motion you're going to do for the shove
it<00:02:01.989> and<00:02:02.140> then<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.489> I<00:02:03.520> want<00:02:03.729> you<00:02:03.849> to

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
it and then this is what I want you to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.270 
it and then this is what I want you to
practice<00:02:04.209> just<00:02:05.200> stand<00:02:05.439> still<00:02:05.679> and<00:02:05.860> practice

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
practice just stand still and practice

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.729 
practice just stand still and practice
this<00:02:06.459> for<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.759> minute<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.329> don't<00:02:07.869> think<00:02:08.500> that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
this for a minute I don't think that

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.589 
this for a minute I don't think that
you're<00:02:08.890> too<00:02:09.190> bad<00:02:09.489> at<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:10.090> think<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
you're too bad at this I think that you

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.069 
you're too bad at this I think that you
do<00:02:10.869> probably<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.799> this<00:02:11.980> down<00:02:12.220> pretty<00:02:12.639> well

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
do probably have this down pretty well

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.330 
do probably have this down pretty well

then here's the next thing I want you to
do<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.489> want<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> practice<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.840> doing<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
shove it with no pop so just scoop your

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.770 
shove it with no pop so just scoop your
back<00:02:20.889> foot<00:02:21.160> super<00:02:21.609> hard<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.180> leave<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
back foot super hard and leave your

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.590 
back foot super hard and leave your
front<00:02:23.049> foot<00:02:23.319> on<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.500> whole<00:02:23.950> time<00:02:24.600> leaving

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
front foot on the whole time leaving

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.930 
front foot on the whole time leaving
your<00:02:25.750> front<00:02:25.959> foot<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.530> extremely<00:02:27.489> key

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
your front foot on is extremely key

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.270 
your front foot on is extremely key
because<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.049> you<00:02:29.170> go<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.319> popping<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> board

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
because when you go to popping the board

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
because when you go to popping the board
in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.549> air<00:02:30.579> you<00:02:31.389> have<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.660> leave<00:02:31.840> your<00:02:32.019> front

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
in the air you have to leave your front

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.379 
in the air you have to leave your front
foot<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.859> keep<00:02:33.069> your<00:02:33.310> board<00:02:33.549> from<00:02:33.760> turning

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
foot on to keep your board from turning

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.970
