futons<00:00:10.820> for<00:00:11.820> women's<00:00:12.120> shortcuts<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.719> you

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
futons for women's shortcuts do you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.350 
futons for women's shortcuts do you
prefer<00:00:13.110> scissor<00:00:13.410> over<00:00:13.500> comb<00:00:13.710> clippers<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:14.880> if

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
prefer scissor over comb clippers or if

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880 
prefer scissor over comb clippers or if
it's<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.870> half<00:00:16.109> an<00:00:16.260> inch<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> an<00:00:16.650> inch

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
it's about in half an inch to an inch

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.890 
it's about in half an inch to an inch
long<00:00:17.160> holding<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.119> fingers<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.600> cutting

long holding in your fingers and cutting
I<00:00:19.050> love<00:00:19.529> your<00:00:19.680> input<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> difference

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
I love your input on the difference

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
I love your input on the difference
first<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.779> Charlene<00:00:22.199> let's<00:00:22.410> talk<00:00:22.619> about

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
first of all Charlene let's talk about

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.670 
first of all Charlene let's talk about
scissor<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.279> comb<00:00:23.689> Clippers<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.930> don't<00:00:25.500> work

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
scissor over comb Clippers I don't work

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.560 
scissor over comb Clippers I don't work
with<00:00:25.710> Clippers<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> can't<00:00:26.789> answer<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> one

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with Clippers so I can't answer that one

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.790 
with Clippers so I can't answer that one
but<00:00:27.840> let's<00:00:27.869> talk<00:00:28.080> about<00:00:28.140> scissor<00:00:28.529> over<00:00:28.590> comb

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but let's talk about scissor over comb

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.679 
but let's talk about scissor over comb
when<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.789> working<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.210> scissor<00:00:30.660> over

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
when you're working with scissor over

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
when you're working with scissor over
comb<00:00:30.990> what's<00:00:31.500> important<00:00:31.980> number<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
comb what's important number one is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
comb what's important number one is
you're<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> work<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> longer<00:00:34.950> shear

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you're going to work with a longer shear

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
you're going to work with a longer shear
the<00:00:36.030> reason<00:00:36.450> being<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.860> can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the reason being is because you can

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
the reason being is because you can
cover<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.489> width<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.239> section<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> way

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
cover more width of a section that way

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
cover more width of a section that way
rather<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.950> working<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> short<00:00:41.670> shear

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
rather than working with a short shear

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
rather than working with a short shear
you're<00:00:42.090> only<00:00:42.270> covering<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.780> much<00:00:42.989> number<00:00:43.620> one

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you're only covering so much number one

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060 
you're only covering so much number one
number<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:45.210> movement<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.379> comb<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
number two the movement of your comb and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430 
number two the movement of your comb and
your<00:00:47.579> shear<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> consistent<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> way

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
your shear is consistent all the way

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 
your shear is consistent all the way
through<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.340> moment<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> stop<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> comb<00:00:51.870> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
through the moment you stop the comb and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
through the moment you stop the comb and
cut<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.399> fall<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> hard

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
cut you're going to fall with a hard

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.389 
cut you're going to fall with a hard
line<00:00:54.329> by<00:00:55.110> continually<00:00:55.710> keeping<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.219> moving

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
line by continually keeping this moving

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.740 
line by continually keeping this moving
I'll<00:00:56.670> give<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> profile<00:00:57.270> view<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I'll give you a profile view of this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
I'll give you a profile view of this
look<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.469> elevating<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> hair<00:00:59.250> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
look how I'm elevating the hair it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.209 
look how I'm elevating the hair it's
elevated<00:01:00.090> above<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.899> horizontal<00:01:01.590> line<00:01:01.710> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
elevated above a horizontal line it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.729 
elevated above a horizontal line it's
elevated<00:01:02.609> diagonally<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
elevated diagonally when you do that and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.210 
elevated diagonally when you do that and
you<00:01:04.860> close<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> fall<00:01:06.630> softer<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you close it's going to fall softer if I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
you close it's going to fall softer if I
elevate<00:01:08.820> straight<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.479> horizontally<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
elevate straight out horizontally and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.580 
elevate straight out horizontally and
close<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.270> fall<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.960> steps<00:01:13.320> or

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
close you're going to fall with steps or

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.940 
close you're going to fall with steps or
a<00:01:13.650> hard<00:01:13.979> line<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.939> remember<00:01:15.390> keep<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.200> shear

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
a hard line so remember keep the shear

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.330 
a hard line so remember keep the shear
and<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.520> comb<00:01:17.759> moving<00:01:18.210> consistently<00:01:18.840> next<00:01:19.590> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and the comb moving consistently next be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
and the comb moving consistently next be
aware<00:01:20.729> what's<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.600> distance<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:23.009> away

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
aware what's the distance you're away

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.570 
aware what's the distance you're away
from<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.150> head<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.049> distance<00:01:25.680> visually

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
from the head that distance visually

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
from the head that distance visually
needs<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.090> continue<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.380> way<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.770> when

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
needs to continue all the way up when

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.399 
needs to continue all the way up when
you<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.400> scissor<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.790> comb<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.200> come

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you work scissor over comb if you come

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
you work scissor over comb if you come
in<00:01:31.619> you're<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.979> distance<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
in you're this distance and then as you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090 
in you're this distance and then as you
move<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.140> move<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.560> closer

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
move in you move in closer

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.069 
move in you move in closer
now<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.790> getting<00:01:36.090> steps<00:01:36.450> you're<00:01:37.049> taking

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
now you're getting steps you're taking

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
now you're getting steps you're taking
it<00:01:37.530> shorter<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.670> keep<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.060> back

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it shorter you're gonna keep going back

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
it shorter you're gonna keep going back
and<00:01:39.390> cleaning<00:01:39.750> things<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.439> here's<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> hot

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and cleaning things up here's the hot

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
and cleaning things up here's the hot
tip<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.060> put<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:42.869> blunt<00:01:43.110> shear<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.680> and

that's<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> guarantee<00:01:50.430> every<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that's going to guarantee every time I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.740 
that's going to guarantee every time I
close<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> end<00:01:53.880> up<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> soft
