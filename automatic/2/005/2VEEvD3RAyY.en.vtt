00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.740
 then review dedicated to sonic from 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.959
 ski the title and the sigg 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.570
 the fastest hedgehog in the world returns 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.759
 in a new game where he will have to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.249
 Dodge the obstacles Jump over the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.949
 barriers accelerate in the circles and 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.660
 obviously defeat the enemies you don't 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.599
 main is made up of the top 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 game center button on the right e 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.619
 bonuses and items you need 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 collect during the journey in the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.269
 central part we can choose the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.900
 character as you see we can go 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.580
 to buy others and unlock with 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.370
 precisely the bonuses and items that 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.080
 we will collect the rate settings where 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 we can set music example and i 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.310
 sound effects reset the tutorial ad 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.560
 example in this case we reset it 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.830
 so let's go and see the game together 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.470
 then I will also show the other items 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.350
 then we have the challenge button 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.960
 of the day the key relative to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.840
 goals then to the missions that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 will serve to level up the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.549
 our character that obviously the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.689
 store you will be able to buy items 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.399
 the upgrades the ring obviously the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.380
 rings if they go to collect during 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.590
 the path and will also allow us then 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.679
 to unlock the objects and then also the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.039
 ring for free but we have a game e 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.079
 let's see immediately how the title works 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.649
 very simple 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 we are better I started in the tutorial 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.009
 so we see the keys practically 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 main features of the game with swipe toward 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.100
 the bass obviously will not 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.289
 only to lower ourselves but also and 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.719
 especially going to defeat i 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.399
 Enemies those rare balls of his 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.770
 we move from one side to another and in 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.310
 this case the tutorial is really 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.560
 very simple and immediate we enter the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.740
 real live of the game we make one 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.259
 very fast game in this case are 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.330
 immediately died so we went to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.600
 end up in the water 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.580
 the score shows us in what we have 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.050
 harvest that are added to the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.290
 others the various objects and records and we have 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.060
 a new game very fast 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.800
 to underline the excellent graphic care 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.040
 of the title in 3d really well-kept e 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.430
 obviously this is the bread for the teeth 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.780
 of sonic ie run avoid obstacles 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.120
 knock down the enemies and as you see graphics 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.810
 really well kept in the least 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.830
 details and then obviously bright colors 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.380
 how we're used to sonic titles 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.480
 but above all of physics therefore really 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.209
 very beautiful this part of the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.400
 we have completed the level on 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.100
 right completing and then collecting 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.560
 all the various rings fill this up 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.570
 slash this bar when completed 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.190
 will allow us to accelerate and 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.930
 use speed to destroy 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.030
 example of obstacles break down i 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.030
 enemies away saying we went to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.670
 slamming that we have therefore arrived at 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.410
 end of our ride therefore sonic 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.320
 from c is really an excellent title 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.030
 we have also unlocked another one 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.800
 mission that will take us back to 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 live the role of the fastest hedgehog 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.110
 of the world in and beautiful adventure e 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.510
 between dodging obstacles, jumping barriers 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.700
 accelerate in circles and defeat 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 lots of enemies using the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.130
 devastating attack in search of sonic 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.739
 for lovers of the genre but above all 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.310
 of this character we know 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.519
 very well can only have it at 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.519
 next
