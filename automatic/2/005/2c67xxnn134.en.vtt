00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.000
 from the beginning his was the voice 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.440
 I am elena silva 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.620

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.329
 audiovisual in a radio subject 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.730

 very happy we open a little bit of everything 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.830
 but I wanted to double because they came 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 several dubbing stars and I started to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.140
 put to put to put but as it is so 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.110
 complicated me from the beginning I started 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.390
 to look for banks of producing voices and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 send things and the senate advancing I 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.700
 minister of study and working on 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.780
 all on my own 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 I saw them transform into a very young girl 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 Shy 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.069
 wonderful I believe that's how 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 got what many of us dream of working 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.880
 with the greatest from his land 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.500
 Natal Asturias I have my own 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.509
 studio in asturias has also visited 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.619
 here through jobs but now I 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.950
 I'm specializing in working on 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.719
 everything abroad I have a client 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.380
 that is from canada we connect through 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.049
 from Skype 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.819
 he leads me sessions and I just 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.719
 recorded everything from asturias now we are 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:00.109

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.000
 They pay much more with much abroad 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.550
 before 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.290
 and it's where there's work if you're sick of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 move well learn from Ã¡lex and you have chosen 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.679
 another way to travel share with you 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 together English 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.920
 Then what do we do? 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.990
 who called us not to ride what you and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.850
 love you always from humility 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.000
 because of people who love each other 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.459
 too much and it's not good and look 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
 alternatives think don you need voice 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.560
 to this day it 's up to the elevators we 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.870
 speak is that it speaks everything so let's think 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.570
 which companies can devote to those 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.190
 things and you have to write them write 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.110
 and show them your work and I for example 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.050
 at the beginning I invented demos 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.489
 I invented ads that I had already made 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.620
 telephone exchanges because that's how it was 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.570
 the only way to give them something that is not 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.570
 was copied and they were not going to know 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.040
 yes yes it was real or not and they need 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.820
 our guys to ride it for their 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.950
 account 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.110
 patience that they bet on them and that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.380
 they spend money that they mount something 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.620
 They alone 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.230
 and that they persevere that they do not 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.110
 get tired and ignore anyone who 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.770
 if they believe filling that what is it 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.620
 continue because they will get it 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.720
 the dreams as we are going to know each other 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.540
 everybody me everything by email for 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 google and if you have a web page 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.780
 face-to-face because people find you 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.100
 I do not know how but it has finished you 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780
 find him 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.080
 you have to have your web your networks 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.750
 social via twitter goes a lot 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.330
 work 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.730
 and put the tags right 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.340
 and it works in fact I always say it 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.740
 that when they send me an email 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.810
 often look to see on what date 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.640
 I had sent the presentation already 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.650
 Sometimes two years pass or I am 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.170
 now receiving people who love me 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.060
 contract and send them an email in 2011 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.110
 a surprise and continue to follow me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.910
 I tell you that this life is like a 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.160
 roller coaster that sometimes you're up you 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.390
 It has come out a great job you have 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.580
 to go on a trip you pay all the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.610
 charges you charge a lot and then after two 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.640
 months and nothing 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.100
 but you have to know how to enjoy it so much 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.830
 to be above as below me when not 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.900

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.040
 the demos upload jobs to the web 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.080
 do the invasive 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.120
 and give it to the head to think I have 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.410
 a coil as well as very original with 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.650

 little things that we all have things 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.290

 between dubs and locutions the n imparts 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.100
