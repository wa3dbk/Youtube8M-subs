00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.250
 the blows with the palm of the hand and the 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.110
 hammer fist are surely the most 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.410
 natural and intuitive of all 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.300
 possible modalities probably the 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.090
 greater advantage that this group of 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.860
 hits is that it can be launched from both 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.020
 guards and disguised as from 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.369
 any other position allowing the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.090
 preparation to launch attacks 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.130
 immediate higher intensity 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 this sheet does not include the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 actions with the tips of your fingers and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.830
 phalanges that deserve treatment 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.370
 apart and that develop at the level 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.370
 4 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 the possibilities that this provides 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.410
 techniques are very varied in terms of 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 full hand including fingers 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.220
 obviously the additional scope that 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.230
 they provide facilitates the possibility of 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.760
 to be able to act on the opponent from 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 the longest possible distance 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 has the disadvantage that the fingers 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 They are the most fragile part of the hand and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 what the objectives should be according to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.229
 with this circumstance it is possible 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 apply the striking surface 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.240
 fully extended or supporting a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.039
 form of suction cup that allows to apply a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.080
 hit and with a significant increase in 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.390
 pressure which can cause effects 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390
 decisive over the ears of the adversary 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.920
 if the fingers are excluded 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.320
 allows to increase the strength of a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 relatively moderate mode has its 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.340
 maximum utility over vulnerable areas 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.600
 of the adversary as the face or the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.600
 neck around its perimeter 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.039
 at the base of the hand in this case the 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.429
 power that can be applied is a lot 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.619
 higher 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.929
 allowing considerable penetrations 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.090
 since the resistance of this part 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.680
 It allows to protect the bony areas of the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 fighter 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.120
 therefore in the strokes applied with the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.220
 hand the level of force increases 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.640
 as the surface of the area decreases 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.640
 hitting 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 in accordance with the indicated 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.810
 previously let's see the classification of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.790
 the blows with the palm of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.370
 according to the structure of dci 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.560
 in the front front hit as well 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.500
 than any other hit the phases to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.840
 detailed study effects are 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.859
 preparation and launch contact 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 penetration and recovery which is 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.010
 analyze in the subscriber card 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.079
 the front blow thrown by hand 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.810
 Forward is the fastest since 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.670
 presents the shortest trajectory in 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.829
 first cards of the operational courses 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.750
 more model analysis was developed 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.049
 simple of launch trajectory of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.430
 the blows at this level the student already 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.620
 It is in a position to evaluate 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.190
 certain details of character more 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.190
 advanced 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.550
 in the back front hit unlike 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.800
 from the previous case in this example it 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.660
 produces a minimum advance so the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.640
 Attack trajectory is shown without 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.470
 be affected just by the movement of 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.180
 the legs since they intervene 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.670
 mainly the hips in a 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.170
 very horizontal scroll so that 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.269
 the trajectory can be observed 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.269
 practically rectilinear of the blow 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.360
 both in the case of blows 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.130
 rectilinear as in the circular ones is 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.160
 possible to use any of the zones 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.840
 of hitting indicated above although 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.940
 in the case of the rectilinear ones the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.880
 Full hand contact is more 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.980
 indicated to push the blows 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.720
 circular however they have tours 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.390
 much longer than the hit affect and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.370
 lines 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.350
 part of these tours may 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.720
 hide the adversary by means of 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.240
 actions of distraction and of 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.640
 concealment of the advance as is the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.980
 escort tactics shown in this 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.470
 example and it is developed in the tab for 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.270
 subscribers in it the hand is used 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 right to remove any obstacle 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.980
 presented by the adversary 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.680
 all the backhand strokes are very 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.539
 effective thanks to the surprise effect that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 provoke as a consequence of what 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.719
 unexpected of the action and direction of the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.550
 attack 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.530
 as a disadvantage , there is little 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.150
 power that can be applied to them 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.219
 relationship with the previous blows 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.650
 although they are enough to neutralize 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.659
 the adversary and continue immediately 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.659
 taking advantage of the advantage situation
