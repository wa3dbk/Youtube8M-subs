00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
much like getting ready for Vancouver
the<00:01:16.320> track<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> everything<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.430> track<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the track and everything the track is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.130 
the track and everything the track is
actually<00:01:18.240> quite<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.990> but

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
actually quite a bit different but

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
actually quite a bit different but
there's<00:01:19.860> two<00:01:20.009> things<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.549> similar<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
there's two things that are similar the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.230 
there's two things that are similar the
start<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.590> grade<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> drop<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:24.000> similar

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
start the grade of drop is very similar

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420 
start the grade of drop is very similar
to<00:01:24.390> Vancouver<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> speed<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.280> go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to Vancouver as well as the speed we go

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
to Vancouver as well as the speed we go
about<00:01:26.640> 80<00:01:26.880> miles<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.210> hour<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
about 80 miles an hour here and in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
about 80 miles an hour here and in
Vancouver<00:01:28.409> we'll<00:01:28.590> probably<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.920> about<00:01:29.009> 90<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
Vancouver we'll probably go about 90 so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.039 
Vancouver we'll probably go about 90 so
this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.509> close<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this is about as close as you get to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.180 
this is about as close as you get to
that

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.950 
that
so<00:01:32.580> that's<00:01:33.090> pretty<00:01:33.300> good<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.690> then<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so that's pretty good but then the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
so that's pretty good but then the

this easy last step nothing was easy but

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.620 
this easy last step nothing was easy but
it<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:33.310> didn't<00:03:33.519> happen<00:03:33.670> last<00:03:33.970> time<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:34.600> I
