can get your account act which I'm

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.440

imagining<00:00:31.890> most<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.850> rather<00:00:33.120> avoid

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
imagining most of you would rather avoid

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.540 
imagining most of you would rather avoid
and<00:00:33.989> there's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.649> easy<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> avoid

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and there's a really easy way to avoid

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.160 
and there's a really easy way to avoid
this<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> today<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> teach<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
this and today I'm going to teach you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
this and today I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:37.320> other<00:00:37.980> than<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.910> knowing<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.420> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
how other than just knowing that it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
how other than just knowing that it's
very<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.469> unlikely<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.070> youtuber<00:00:41.520> will

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
very very unlikely that a youtuber will

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.910 
very very unlikely that a youtuber will
ever<00:00:41.820> post<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> link<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.469> comments<00:00:43.890> section

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
ever post a link in the comments section

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
ever post a link in the comments section
the<00:00:44.250> video<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.760> would<00:00:45.270> imagine<00:00:45.360> at<00:00:45.960> least<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the video I would imagine at least I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260 
the video I would imagine at least I
know<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.829> me<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.160> true<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.030> if

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
know this for me to be true that if

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
know this for me to be true that if
someone<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> link<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.469> something

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
someone is going to link you something

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
someone is going to link you something
they'll<00:00:50.070> post<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> description<00:00:50.700> in

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
they'll post it in the description in

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.670 
they'll post it in the description in
their<00:00:51.270> video<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> screen<00:00:52.379> somewhere

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
their video or on the screen somewhere

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.979 
their video or on the screen somewhere
generally<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> should<00:00:53.760> never<00:00:54.090> trust<00:00:54.480> links

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
generally you should never trust links

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.810 
generally you should never trust links
in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.350> comments<00:00:55.620> section<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> rule<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in the comments section as a rule of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
in the comments section as a rule of
thumb<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.780> there's<00:00:57.930> also<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:58.859> easy

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
thumb but there's also a very very easy

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
thumb but there's also a very very easy
way<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.430> tell<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
way to tell if it is actually the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
way to tell if it is actually the
uploader<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.070> video<00:01:02.250> making<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.760> comment
