this<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.290> has<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> little<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.819> 150

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
this it has a little little 150

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
this it has a little little 150
horse<00:02:14.629> engine<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> same

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
horse engine in it so it's the same

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.369 
horse engine in it so it's the same
plane<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> think<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.180> got<00:02:17.390> my<00:02:17.629> certification<00:02:18.290> on

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
plane I think I got my certification on

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.550 
plane I think I got my certification on
a<00:02:18.410> few<00:02:18.680> years<00:02:18.920> ago<00:02:19.099> and<00:02:19.849> did<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> test

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
a few years ago and did the test

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
a few years ago and did the test
I<00:02:20.590> think<00:02:21.130> it's<00:02:21.250> older<00:02:21.640> than<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.090> me<00:02:22.180> put

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
I think it's older than you and me put

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.720 
I think it's older than you and me put
together<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:23.350> crappie<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.160> no<00:02:24.400> it's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
together the crappie is it no it's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.960 
together the crappie is it no it's
probably<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.240> 73<00:02:26.140> 74<00:02:26.770> somewhere<00:02:27.250> right<00:02:27.400> there

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
probably a 73 74 somewhere right there

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.670 
probably a 73 74 somewhere right there
might<00:02:28.390> be<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.660> 78<00:02:30.720> well<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.930> floatplane<00:02:32.440> pilots

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
might be a 78 well and floatplane pilots

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.650 
might be a 78 well and floatplane pilots
are<00:02:33.190> about<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> rarest<00:02:33.850> pilots<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.480> can

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
are about the rarest pilots that you can

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
are about the rarest pilots that you can
find<00:02:34.900> as<00:02:35.080> well<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.130> lot<00:02:36.280> less<00:02:36.550> than

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
find as well I know it's a lot less than

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.910 
find as well I know it's a lot less than
private<00:02:37.300> pilots<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.989> commercial<00:02:38.440> pilots<00:02:38.800> as

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
private pilots and commercial pilots as

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.130 
private pilots and commercial pilots as
well<00:02:39.100> but<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.670> sure<00:02:39.880> as<00:02:39.910> heck<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.390> about<00:02:40.989> the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
well but it sure as heck is about the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.400 
well but it sure as heck is about the
most<00:02:41.319> fun<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:43.630> right<00:02:43.780> well<00:02:43.930> let's<00:02:44.080> go<00:02:44.200> fly

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
most fun all right well let's go fly

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.280 
most fun all right well let's go fly
okay<00:02:45.160> sounds<00:02:45.459> good<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.940> me

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.690 

well<00:02:51.290> there's<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.620> couple<00:02:51.799> reasons<00:02:52.159> you<00:02:52.489> want

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
well there's a couple reasons you want

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.399 
well there's a couple reasons you want
to<00:02:52.760> do<00:02:52.939> that<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.450> want<00:02:53.629> to<00:02:53.719> get<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.019> extra

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
to do that you want to get the extra

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.429 
to do that you want to get the extra
weight<00:02:54.650> out<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.879> aircraft<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:56.930> one<00:02:57.109> thing

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
weight out of the aircraft for one thing

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.130 
weight out of the aircraft for one thing
yeah<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.159> mean<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.510> too<00:02:59.719> much<00:02:59.900> weight

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
yeah I mean if you have too much weight

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.929 
yeah I mean if you have too much weight
on<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.560> side<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.069> airplane<00:03:01.370> versus<00:03:01.849> the

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
on one side of the airplane versus the

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.490 
on one side of the airplane versus the
other<00:03:02.060> side<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.480> aircraft<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.019> going<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> list

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
other side the aircraft is going to list

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.580 
other side the aircraft is going to list
in<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.519> if<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:05.060> gets<00:03:05.269> too<00:03:05.569> full<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.079> could<00:03:06.290> sink

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
in it if it gets too full it could sink

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.399 
in it if it gets too full it could sink
on<00:03:06.799> one<00:03:06.980> side<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.209> would<00:03:08.359> be<00:03:08.510> bad<00:03:08.689> you

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
on one side and that would be bad you

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.619 
on one side and that would be bad you
think<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:10.129> would<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.280> bad<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:14.150> soon<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:14.510> we

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
think that would be bad as soon as we

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.599 
think that would be bad as soon as we
shove<00:03:14.870> off<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.230> dock<00:03:15.439> I'm<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.189> jump<00:03:16.459> in

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
shove off the dock I'm going to jump in

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.490 
shove off the dock I'm going to jump in
and<00:03:16.639> get<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.030> engine<00:03:17.389> started<00:03:17.810> no<00:03:18.109> time<00:03:18.349> to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and get that engine started no time to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.440 
and get that engine started no time to
buckle<00:03:18.709> up<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.129> close<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.519> doors<00:03:19.790> because

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
buckle up or close the doors because

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.210 
buckle up or close the doors because
we've<00:03:20.750> got<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.049> get<00:03:21.170> power<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.650> rudder<00:03:21.920> so

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
we've got to get power to the rudder so

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.240 
we've got to get power to the rudder so
we<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.489> maintain<00:03:22.639> control<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.480> aircraft

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
we can maintain control of the aircraft

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.839 
we can maintain control of the aircraft
okay<00:03:27.040> okay

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.009 

Bill's<00:03:31.849> just<00:03:32.090> going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.299> hop<00:03:32.419> onto<00:03:32.629> one<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
Bill's just going to hop onto one of the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.080 
Bill's just going to hop onto one of the
floats<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.560> coach<00:03:34.099> me<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.519> go<00:03:34.639> along

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:04:24.899 

okay<00:03:39.120> where<00:03:41.270> there's<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> mess<00:03:42.960> right

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:31.760 

robbed

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.200 

flying<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.890> floatplane<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.520> all<00:04:33.670> about<00:04:33.910> touch

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
flying a floatplane is all about touch

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.450 
flying a floatplane is all about touch
you've<00:04:35.140> got<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.410> get<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.560> good<00:04:35.770> feel<00:04:36.070> for<00:04:36.100> when

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
you've got to get a good feel for when

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.600 
you've got to get a good feel for when
the<00:04:36.580> floats<00:04:36.940> get<00:04:37.750> up<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.080> plane<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.710> when

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
the floats get up on a plane and when

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.370 
the floats get up on a plane and when
they<00:04:39.730> break<00:04:39.940> away<00:04:40.120> from<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.420> cavitation<00:04:41.260> of

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
they break away from that cavitation of

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.620 
they break away from that cavitation of
the<00:04:41.470> water<00:04:42.120> sometimes<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.240> have<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.450> wiggle

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
the water sometimes you have to wiggle

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.480 
the water sometimes you have to wiggle
the<00:04:43.840> wing<00:04:44.020> from<00:04:44.320> side<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.590> side<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:44.980> get<00:04:45.250> one

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the wing from side to side to get one

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.050 
the wing from side to side to get one
float<00:04:45.760> off<00:04:45.940> first<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:47.080> once<00:04:47.230> they<00:04:47.410> get<00:04:47.530> off

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
float off first but once they get off

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.000 
float off first but once they get off
it's<00:04:49.060> smooth<00:04:49.480> sailing<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:50.650> only<00:04:50.800> thing<00:04:50.950> you

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
it's smooth sailing the only thing you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.200 
it's smooth sailing the only thing you
have<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.160> look<00:04:51.340> out<00:04:51.490> for<00:04:51.700> is<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.940> trees

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
have to look out for is the trees

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.330 
have to look out for is the trees
because<00:04:52.780> they<00:04:53.110> always<00:04:53.290> climb<00:04:53.680> faster<00:04:54.190> than

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
because they always climb faster than

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:05.310 
because they always climb faster than
the<00:04:54.430> plane<00:04:54.670> does<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:04.330> truly<00:05:04.720> takes<00:05:04.960> me<00:05:05.110> back

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
the plane does this truly takes me back

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.440 
the plane does this truly takes me back
to<00:05:05.350> my<00:05:05.530> roots<00:05:05.830> I<00:05:06.130> used<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:06.940> be<00:05:07.030> afraid<00:05:07.120> of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
flying now it's one of my most fun and
useful<00:05:09.790> hobbies

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
adventurer back in aviation for me even

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.980 
adventurer back in aviation for me even
acrobatics<00:05:25.210> have<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.420> more<00:05:25.690> controlled

precise feel flying on floats is all

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.680 
precise feel flying on floats is all
about<00:05:30.040> feel<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.640> judgment<00:05:31.150> as<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.330> pick<00:05:31.570> out

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
about feel and judgment as you pick out

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.630 
about feel and judgment as you pick out
a<00:05:31.750> suitable<00:05:32.140> body<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:32.740> water<00:05:32.920> set<00:05:33.430> down<00:05:33.580> your

no margin for error the biggest surprise

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.320 
no margin for error the biggest surprise
for<00:05:44.530> me<00:05:44.740> when<00:05:45.010> I<00:05:45.040> learned<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.460> fly<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:46.000> float

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
for me when I learned to fly a float

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.900 
for me when I learned to fly a float
plane<00:05:46.570> was<00:05:47.320> that<00:05:47.500> landing<00:05:47.950> was<00:05:48.100> so<00:05:48.370> difficult

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
plane was that landing was so difficult

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.180 
plane was that landing was so difficult
when<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.270> waters<00:05:49.600> glassy<00:05:49.930> if<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.950> think

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
when the waters glassy if you think

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.800 
when the waters glassy if you think
about<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:51.580> it's<00:05:51.730> just<00:05:51.910> like<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.150> mirror<00:05:52.540> so<00:05:52.720> you

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
about it it's just like a mirror so you

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.840 
about it it's just like a mirror so you
don't<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.140> any<00:05:53.380> depth<00:05:53.710> perception<00:05:54.400> you<00:05:54.730> have

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
don't have any depth perception you have

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.670 
don't have any depth perception you have
to<00:05:55.000> set<00:05:55.180> your<00:05:55.330> rate<00:05:55.450> of<00:05:55.510> descent<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:56.470> just

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
to set your rate of descent and just

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.020 
to set your rate of descent and just
trust<00:05:56.950> that<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.250> plane<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.610> going<00:05:57.700> to<00:05:57.760> come

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
trust that the plane is going to come

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.990 
trust that the plane is going to come
down<00:05:58.060> softly<00:05:58.720> on<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.110> water<00:05:59.320> then<00:06:00.250> when<00:06:00.880> it

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
down softly on the water then when it

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.520 
down softly on the water then when it
touches<00:06:01.330> down<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.720> can<00:06:01.870> start<00:06:02.110> to<00:06:02.170> pull<00:06:02.350> back

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
touches down you can start to pull back

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.500 
touches down you can start to pull back
the<00:06:02.740> power<00:06:02.950> always<00:06:03.550> keep<00:06:03.910> your<00:06:04.030> nose<00:06:04.210> up<00:06:04.450> so

core ideology for me with flying it
could<00:06:33.820> be<00:06:33.940> any<00:06:34.180> one<00:06:34.390> of<00:06:34.450> my<00:06:34.630> core<00:06:34.870> ideologies

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
talked about it before I got into flying

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.810 
talked about it before I got into flying
all<00:06:40.390> because<00:06:40.870> I<00:06:40.900> was<00:06:41.230> terrified<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:42.010> fly<00:06:42.220> when
