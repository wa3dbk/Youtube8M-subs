00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
stole his speed points and I did pretty

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.160 
stole his speed points and I did pretty
well<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.360> game<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.750> playing<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.020> two

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
well this game I was playing with two

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539 
well this game I was playing with two
other<00:01:40.320> people<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.710> were<00:01:40.799> cops<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.430> them

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
other people that were cops one of them

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.030 
other people that were cops one of them
did<00:01:41.670> better<00:01:41.880> than<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:43.110> uh<00:01:43.170> actually

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
did better than me but uh actually

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.770 
did better than me but uh actually
creamed<00:01:44.520> me<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.119> had<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.240> ninety

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

creamed me I think he had like ninety
six<00:01:45.990> thousand<00:01:46.320> speed<00:01:46.500> points<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
six thousand speed points I think I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
six thousand speed points I think I
ended<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.549> 43,000<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
ended with like 43,000 but as you can

I just want to keep getting up to him
and<00:01:57.960> take<00:01:58.110> him<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and take him out and this is kind of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.499 
and take him out and this is kind of
cool<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:01:59.850> some<00:02:00.090> guy<00:02:00.210> flies

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
cool right here I think some guy flies

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
cool right here I think some guy flies
right<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.079> miss<00:02:01.439> him<00:02:01.590> by<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:01.829> inch<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
right through me I miss him by an inch I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.319 
right through me I miss him by an inch I
probably<00:02:02.430> would<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.640> taken<00:02:02.909> him<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.119> one

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
probably would have taken him out one

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
probably would have taken him out one
shot<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.170> clip<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:05.100> right

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shot like in that first clip but right

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
probably one of the few games that I've

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.840 
probably one of the few games that I've
played<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.620> wasn't<00:03:50.070> called<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.340> duty<00:03:50.640> or

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
played that wasn't called a duty or

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.520
