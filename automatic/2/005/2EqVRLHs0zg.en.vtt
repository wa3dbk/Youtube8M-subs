00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.709
 infrared heat 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.239
 ionizes the air and has the effect 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.459
 magnetic therapy what is the use of 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.110
 turmanium ceramics and so let's by 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.640
 order 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.430
 infrared heat mat warms

 metabolism is restored 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.510
 positive reaction increases 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.840
 implemented a positive impact on 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.850
 all internal organs of ionization is 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 collision of oxygen molecules and turma

 air that fills com 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.840
 magnetic therapy is responsible for normalizing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 metabolism and recovery 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.830

 which is in the pyramids of the rug 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.350
 creates a weak magnetic field and improves 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.780
 work joints and does not cease to crackle 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.010

 muscle fiber contraction 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 pulsed low frequency current in nm-55 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.380
 and myostimulation function are presented 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.090
