00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.700
 automatic night light 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.300
 we usually have a light bulb that illuminates the entrance of our home on 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
 patio of clothes was the antejardÃ­n 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.920
 as it is an illumination that is outside of the house that has not been 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.919
 forgotten to pay it 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.760
 we left it on the day for hours and hours and sometimes for weeks doing 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.150
 unnecessary and sometimes exaggerated energy consumption 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.350
 thinking about a solution to this problem we have designed a device 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.550
 electronic that is responsible for turning on a light bulb at the moment when the sun 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 It hides and shuts off automatically when the sun comes back to the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.310
 early morning similar to lighting lamps of street lighting 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.940
 This circuit works with voltages from 115 to 220 volts without 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.350
 need to make is no change 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.830
 was to light a bulb of up to 100 watts 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.670
 if they want to sender more powerful devices 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.490
 you should only change the pri accept 136 for one that supports more amps like 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 from pp to but 8 600 that supports up to eight amps 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.230
 working 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.600
 the two-point condenser 2 liters for which the entrance is in serious 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.270
 of orchards of the republic restricts the passage of current only allows the passage 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.760
 of about 60 thousand and before them ap 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.560
 symantec 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.439
 The resistance of 330 kg is in parallel with this capacitor 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.920
 is responsible for unloading the capacitor at the time of disconnecting the circuit 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.930
 avoiding that the capacitor that has downloaded type can send us a 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.069
 electric shock when handling the circuit 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:12.279
 in the other entrance of the republic there is a resistance of 10 folios that 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.049
 It works as a fuse and also helps to limit the current 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.650
 after the current passes through the condensate the resistance reaches a 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.830
 god's bridge that is responsible for separating the positive hemicycles from the 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.580
 negative and then be rectified by a capacitor 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.580
 competing alternating current in direct current 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:40.309
 now that we have the rectified voltage and with a minimum current we should 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:45.209
 lower the voltage to about ten volts ps for this we use a god center 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.330
 the resistance of 47 k is the schooling resistance of the servef 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.909
 it needs to be 5 watts 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.620
 since the effort it makes when lowering the current generates a relatively warm 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.489
 tall 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.499
 the resistance viesca that goes in parallel to earth with God in him helps him to 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.429
 this one to bear the load 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:14.829
 the 47 micro condenser for god and the zero point ceramic capacitor 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.070
 a mike for god 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.740
 rectifies the current again, preventing curling 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.349
 now the circuit that is responsible for the ignition automation to the 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.450
 detect darkness and turn off when light is detected 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.849
 the revamped the bb1 is part of a voltage divider together with the photo 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:37.929
 resistance 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:41.709
 This gives the possibility to adjust the sensitivity of the circuit 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.429
 when the current passes through the river status and reaches the central point between 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:51.849
 reo spratly the photo resistance to the moment that the resistance photo receives 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.540
 light let's wait if done or united by negatively polarizing the base of the 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.300
 great fright 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.960
 but when the environment darkens the photo resistance rises to a 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.890
 very high impedance restricting the passage of current at that time is 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.530
 positively polarizes the base of the transistor 2 m 39 0 4 points 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:18.310
 at that moment the transistor conducts between collector and emitter polarizing 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.409
 negatively the base of the transistor 2 Jan 29 0 7 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.500
 which is polarity peking efe 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.860
 this means that it leads when a negative voltage arrives at its base 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.550
 when driving the transistor 2 Jan 29 0 7 a positive collector voltage passes 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.379
 transmitter and goes to lotto coupler lighting the led that is in 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:46.650
 its interior activating the triax photo that is between legs 4 and 6 of the object 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.840
 coupled 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.250
 the task photo they drive between their legs 4 and 6 by sending a current to the 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.250
 gate the day that the pp 136 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.850
 the tri a leads the current of the republic between its terminals t1 and t2 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.280
 and as the bulb is in series this one goes on 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.630
 when the resistance returns to receive them we were well france 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.650
 justice by ariza negatively the base of transistor two in the 39 0 4 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.590
 like this one transistors in the tennis player do not drive and therefore neither does the other 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.780
 transistor nor the other settler and logically will not drive the trial and it 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.240
 turn off the bulb 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.919
 in the pdf file that you can download at the end of the article of this project 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.440
 We have provided the protoboard mounting diagram thinking about the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.410
 electronic students who wish to practice and make their own 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.729
 circuit variations 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.060
 we hope it will be very useful for all
