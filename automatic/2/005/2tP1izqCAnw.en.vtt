comments that I get a lot from Hebrew
Israelites<00:00:23.380> is<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:24.099> quote<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.699> they<00:00:24.820> usually

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
Israelites is a quote that they usually

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.269 
Israelites is a quote that they usually
use<00:00:25.300> I<00:00:26.140> think<00:00:26.380> it's<00:00:26.500> one<00:00:26.680> of<00:00:26.800> their<00:00:26.950> proof

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
use I think it's one of their proof

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.569 
use I think it's one of their proof
texts<00:00:27.700> about<00:00:28.599> their<00:00:29.079> particular<00:00:29.710> concept<00:00:30.340> and

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
they usually go to I guess in the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
said Deuteronomy 28 68 and asked me to

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.710 
said Deuteronomy 28 68 and asked me to
explain<00:00:41.860> it<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.059> someone<00:00:43.420> who<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:43.570> told

same<00:00:47.260> thing<00:00:47.559> and<00:00:47.739> obviously<00:00:48.159> we<00:00:48.640> wouldn't

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
same thing and obviously we wouldn't

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
marked it here it's obviously different

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.390

than<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.230> texts<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.680> Hebrew<00:01:23.740> Israelites

use and the specific reason can be

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.950 
use and the specific reason can be
because<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.760> Hebrew<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.119> a<00:01:28.150> light<00:01:28.360> text<00:01:28.750> says

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
because the Hebrew is a light text says

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.690 
because the Hebrew is a light text says
it'll<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.650> guess<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:30.010> people<00:01:30.160> who<00:01:30.430> they

text to that specific situation you know

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.750 
text to that specific situation you know
and<00:03:12.959> I<00:03:13.260> mean<00:03:13.440> once<00:03:13.650> again<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.370> their

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and I mean once again this is just their

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
and I mean once again this is just their
thing<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.450> their<00:03:15.720> text<00:03:16.110> says<00:03:16.379> something

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
thing so if their text says something

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.319 
thing so if their text says something
different<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.519> have<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.790> admit<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.209> is

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
different you have to admit that this is

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.030 
different you have to admit that this is
obviously<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> different<00:03:19.139> text<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.859> once

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
obviously a different text and once

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.410 
obviously a different text and once
again<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:20.459> Hebrews<00:03:20.730> relates<00:03:21.030> keep<00:03:21.209> claiming

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
again if Hebrews relates keep claiming

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.090 
again if Hebrews relates keep claiming
