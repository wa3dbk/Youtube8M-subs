00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.190
 hello everyone i will show you today 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.990
 how do i do a unedged manicure on 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.380
 unedged manicure, I went wrong 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.150
 two and a half months ago and I am very 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.880
 happy i like it so much 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.260
 what fast 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 neat cuticle is that she is not 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.180
 increases as when trimming manicure 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.430
 so today I'll show you how i am doing 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.880
 unedged manicure for those who just 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.880
 no time 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.920
 the first thing I do is cut down the side 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.829
 rollers I do not cut them exactly like this 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.280
 cut down for this I have a file and not on 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.350
 like from a kind of sapphire she 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.250
 quite well cuts side 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 rollers but at the same time it doesn't tear here 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.460
 he does not wave his skin and I really like 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.399
 choose a nail file that was right here 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.740
 Such a little bit like a nail and 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.880
 you can see the nail 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.250
 we put on this wave and topology 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.720
 and then the nail is not injured 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.850
 slightly angled 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.270
 I cut this side roller and 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:24.399
 i also go through each marigold 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.289
 well that's what we finally got here 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.149
 it's all white dry, I specifically 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.179
 deleted so that you can see how much 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.070
 I cut it just like that 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.679
 this baby is very convenient for me with a brush 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.060
 comb and I had brushes 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.649
 professional but this one for me 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 for some reason, itâ€™s most convenient 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.700
 quite elastic but at the same time 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.159
 soft here these three nails 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.210
 if they are put here from here on 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.310
 cuticles like this i dub them and here 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.340
 they should be the same for me 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.560
 as you can see here this nail is longer 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.740
 that's why it should be cut more 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.689
 I just cut it down the hardest 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.450
 and they should end up with me 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.180
 same here is the little finger little finger 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.630
 should be well by about a millimeter 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.500
 one and a half less and this nail I 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 always comparing with this 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 i'm drinking 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.190
 I always saw sakh nail file 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.739
 in parallel, saw off a little bit these 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.650
 three nails then already put in order 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.820
 that's basically how I got it 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 square shape more or less 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.550
 looms and to the corners here I already 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 I took my grinder to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.020
 corners a little smooth so that they do not 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 were so straight sharp 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.920
 because in everyday life it is not very convenient I 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.140
 I use just the same 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.640
 grinder what I have already said in my 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.349
 former video about manicure 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.450
 but then I did a manicure I 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:55.720
 just doing photos I pass literally 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.630
 a little bit on the nails and so 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.590
 just smoothing these corners right now 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.310
 the most interesting i'm starting to process 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.720
 cuticle like this 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.090
 really like it worries take my 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.790
 Evelyn city and more than once I bought it 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.830
 it's pretty budget and yet 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.370
 time works fine carved manicure 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.950
 the first thing you need to always remember is care 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.680
 for the cuticle that is if all the time 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.560
 constantly let's take an example for 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.860
 habit moisturizes the cuticle and smear 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.200
 hands with cream then everything will be fine and 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.099
 cuticle so does not grow and she already 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.380
 so does not dry 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.660
 i'm smearing here so generously 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.540
 like this for about a minute I 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.090
 waiting for the cuticle to soften 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.820
 and then I start processing 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.370
 just like that spatula starting 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.990
 push away in no way pressing 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.750
 strongly on the nail plate as follows 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.650
 step I take just such a spatula and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.320
 she is very very comfortable to me and this one 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.690
 with a spatula I already clean everything out of 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:12.960
 cuticle and it also removes very well 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.320
 Now he's the edge that is if I did 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:21.060
 I put it like that I am from under the cuticle 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.150
 perfectly delete everything that is there too much 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.390
 when I turn it like that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.890
 very convenient hope you can see that very 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.780
 conveniently she removes this softened one 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.700
 Is this roller for now ? 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.110
 here in this cuticle which is here here 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.550
 so it grows a little 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.130
 way but they are here i'm right 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.820
 explained and you understand me there is this 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.190
 here is this shoulder blade for me just here 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.100
 irreplaceable thing wonderful thing here 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.100
 there is this for a pedicure goes but sometimes 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.550
 I clean it up here on the free 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.400
 land 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.580
 or else i can also calculate if i 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.290
 I see that I have a lot of something accumulated 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.870
 under the cuticle 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.850
 then neatly here and so she cleans 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.160
 copes with it just fine then 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.990
 I have no complaints here and 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.490
 I also go through all the nails 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.740
 I clean all the nails 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.660
 and that's all what happened already as you 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.190
 can see the cuticle perfectly 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.520
 neatly I have it already and can not see and no 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.310
 no move rusik further I start it 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.110
 nourish moisturize and for this i will show 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.199
 you a tool that I really like 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.090
 I just advise you all first. 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.699
 oil whose impudent all his beautiful 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.300
 probably know the teak oil crust 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.860
 and I use it as a brush 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.009
 so you can put in a set there 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.530
 pepe . but it is convenient for me to brush here I 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.960
 I can say girls beautiful butter 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.520
 works great but you need to 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.979
 consider that you need to use it 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.680
 only wet on steamed skin 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.979
 hand I use only after a shower 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.250
 when I already handles a little wet and 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.990
 so I dabbed them with a napkin and then 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.659
 I can only use it for the night 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.880
 this oil on dry skin of hands in no way 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:18.000
 the case can not be because it dries 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.120
 finally but oil works fine 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.090
 And here I now probably showed 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.860
 I do not remember the day myself and polishing wax 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.930
 there is still in my firming me 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.639
 like exactly polishing beautiful 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.889
 means here thanks to this 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.430
 means girls already see it for me 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.700
 there I switched to unedged manicure 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.690
 literally here 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.850
 with a bang and without any loss and was not 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.770
 I'm terrible such a cuticle to straight 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.440
 that was scary to come out as you see me 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.810
 here and so just rubbing at all with me 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.240
 skin dry cuticle dry therefore without 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.660
 this one baby here without this means 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.090
 I'm no longer difficult to get by just here I am 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:02.110
 delighted girls I advise everyone here I 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.910
 smeared cuticle and hole, even without my 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.010
 favorite cream protective hand cream on 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.000
 elk milk all now need to give 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.360
 soak in the cream 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.640
 a little bit to make it all oily 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.270
 it soaked and went away and then I after 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.970
 I do my usual nails 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.710
 manicure and what I did for you 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.260
 I'll show you probably in the next video in 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.960
 which I want to show you my set from 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.810
 steel and not all that I would like you

 advise for unedged manicure and 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.220
 Generally a complete set that I imagine 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.080
 gathered but for today I will be with you 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.330
