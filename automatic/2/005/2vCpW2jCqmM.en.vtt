00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
here's the Mac looking on the

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:56.889 
here's the Mac looking on the
motherboard<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.450> stuff

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
motherboard and stuff

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.010 
motherboard and stuff
so<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:58.039> thing<00:00:58.280> for<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.670> do<00:00:58.850> with<00:00:59.750> your

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
so one thing for you to do with your

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.529 
so one thing for you to do with your
MacBook<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:01.100> know<00:01:01.219> take<00:01:01.760> out<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.030> RAM<00:01:02.210> and

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
MacBook is you know take out the RAM and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:20.289 
MacBook is you know take out the RAM and
put<00:01:03.289> it<00:01:03.410> back<00:01:03.530> in<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.699> know

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.730 

and<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.080> rhymes<00:01:22.290> out<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.500> just

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and you know it rhymes out you know just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
and you know it rhymes out you know just
clean<00:01:27.049> you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:29.130> could<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.420> take

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
clean you know you could you could take

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.850 
clean you know you could you could take
it<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.110> put<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.830> doesn't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it out and put it back in if it doesn't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
it out and put it back in if it doesn't
work<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.549> probably<00:01:33.119> clean<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.479> contact

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
work you know probably clean the contact

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
work you know probably clean the contact
pins<00:01:34.310> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:36.090> here

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pins right here in here

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
pins right here in here
and<00:01:37.289> if<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> doesn't<00:01:38.369> work<00:01:40.310> here's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and if that doesn't work here's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.590 
and if that doesn't work here's
something<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:43.399> war<00:01:44.399> arm<00:01:44.820> probably<00:01:45.299> saved

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
something that at war arm probably saved

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
something that at war arm probably saved
a<00:01:45.750> lot<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> money<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:47.399> don't<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.820> buy<00:01:47.940> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
a lot of money you don't have to buy a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.380 
a lot of money you don't have to buy a
new<00:01:48.119> logic<00:01:48.299> board<00:01:48.690> or<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> ram<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:51.090> think

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
new logic board or a ram if you think

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.830 
new logic board or a ram if you think
that's<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.659> problem<00:01:52.340> really<00:01:53.340> sometimes<00:01:54.330> what

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's the problem really sometimes what

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.820 
that's the problem really sometimes what
is<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.080> was<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.470> happened<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.830> me<00:01:55.920> um<00:01:57.830> this

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
is it was what happened to me um this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.090 
is it was what happened to me um this
screw<00:01:59.490> right<00:01:59.789> here<00:01:59.850> these<00:02:00.659> four<00:02:01.020> screws<00:02:01.289> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
screw right here these four screws that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.870 
screw right here these four screws that
hold<00:02:02.429> this<00:02:02.700> socket<00:02:03.179> in<00:02:03.300> place<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.819> don't<00:02:05.819> know

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
hold this socket in place I don't know

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.600 
hold this socket in place I don't know
sometimes<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.539> might<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.840> tight<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> what

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
sometimes they might be tight so what

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:18.910 
sometimes they might be tight so what
you<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.850> do<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.390> arm<00:02:10.310> unscrew<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:13.620> screw

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.840 

because<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.549> too<00:02:20.640> tight

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.030 

and<00:02:28.850> you'll<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:29.780> all<00:02:30.050> them<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.620> then

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and you'll do that for all them and then

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.250 
and you'll do that for all them and then
you'll<00:02:31.190> screw<00:02:31.400> back<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.880> make<00:02:32.690> sure<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.020> do

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
you'll screw back in make sure you do

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.870 
you'll screw back in make sure you do
not<00:02:33.470> over-tighten<00:02:33.920> them<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:34.700> that's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
not over-tighten them because that's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.130 
not over-tighten them because that's
probably<00:02:35.180> what<00:02:35.390> happens

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
probably what happens

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.370 
probably what happens
that's<00:02:36.530> probably<00:02:36.710> what<00:02:37.420> makes<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.750> MacBook

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that's probably what makes the MacBook

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.050 
that's probably what makes the MacBook
not<00:02:39.590> work<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.920> got<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:43.340> from<00:02:43.550> MacRumors

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
not work and I got this from MacRumors

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.480 
not work and I got this from MacRumors
um<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:45.710> might<00:02:45.860> also<00:02:46.040> want<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.460> do<00:02:46.550> SMC<00:02:47.090> reset

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
um you might also want to do SMC reset

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.830 
um you might also want to do SMC reset
if<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:51.230> RAM<00:02:51.500> doesn't<00:02:51.830> work<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.850> um<00:02:55.850> if<00:02:56.390> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
if the RAM doesn't work and um if it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.240 
if the RAM doesn't work and um if it
doesn't<00:02:57.110> work<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.500> change<00:02:57.800> your<00:02:58.040> RAM

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
doesn't work and you change your RAM

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
doesn't work and you change your RAM
probably<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.150> problem<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.020> um<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.920> have

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
probably the problem is that um you have

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.040 
probably the problem is that um you have
the<00:03:01.160> wrong<00:03:01.340> type<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.820> RAM<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:05.690> the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
the wrong type of RAM because the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.480 
the wrong type of RAM because the
beeping<00:03:06.230> doesn't<00:03:06.650> mean<00:03:06.770> anything<00:03:07.130> else<00:03:07.400> it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
beeping doesn't mean anything else it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.220 
beeping doesn't mean anything else it
just<00:03:07.520> means<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.030> there's<00:03:08.270> or<00:03:08.630> there's<00:03:09.050> like

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
just means that there's or there's like

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.380 
just means that there's or there's like
the<00:03:09.830> RAM<00:03:10.190> cannot<00:03:10.520> be<00:03:10.640> detected<00:03:11.090> where<00:03:11.270> it's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
the RAM cannot be detected where it's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.200 
the RAM cannot be detected where it's
not<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.750> working<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.820> yeah<00:03:13.820> if<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.060> have<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
not like working so yeah if you have the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.310 
not like working so yeah if you have the
wrong<00:03:14.420> type<00:03:14.690> of<00:03:14.720> RAM

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
wrong type of RAM

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.620 
wrong type of RAM
that's<00:03:16.130> probably<00:03:16.370> why<00:03:17.150> or<00:03:17.510> um<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:19.100> know<00:03:19.910> if

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
that's probably why or um you know if

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.700 
that's probably why or um you know if
your<00:03:21.290> computer<00:03:22.220> doesn't<00:03:22.370> work<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.820> you're

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
your computer doesn't work and you're

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.350 
your computer doesn't work and you're
here<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:24.860> original<00:03:24.980> ramp<00:03:25.430> maybe<00:03:25.970> your<00:03:26.180> RAM

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
here the original ramp maybe your RAM

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.190 
here the original ramp maybe your RAM
went<00:03:26.600> bad<00:03:27.550> but<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.790> know<00:03:28.940> usually<00:03:29.840> sometimes

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
went bad but you know usually sometimes

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.340 
went bad but you know usually sometimes
it's<00:03:30.530> rare<00:03:30.800> if<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.580> remember<00:03:31.880> back<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.200> you

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
it's rare if you remember back but you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.480 
it's rare if you remember back but you
know<00:03:33.440> make<00:03:33.770> sure<00:03:33.800> you<00:03:33.950> just<00:03:34.130> clean<00:03:34.340> everything

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
know make sure you just clean everything

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.930 
know make sure you just clean everything
if<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:35.660> doesn't<00:03:35.960> work<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:37.370> know<00:03:37.490> make

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
if it doesn't work and you know make

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.760 
if it doesn't work and you know make
sure<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.570> everything<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:39.020> over<00:03:39.350> tightened

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
sure not everything is over tightened

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.270 
sure not everything is over tightened
and<00:03:39.970> also<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.690> does<00:03:41.750> work<00:03:42.320> because<00:03:42.590> really

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
and also this does work because really

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.520 
and also this does work because really
what<00:03:43.490> happened<00:03:43.820> with<00:03:43.910> me<00:03:44.060> was<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.630> um<00:03:47.530> one

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
what happened with me was that um one

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.750 
what happened with me was that um one
slot<00:03:48.860> didn't<00:03:49.310> work

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
slot didn't work

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.520 
slot didn't work
so<00:03:50.000> like<00:03:50.650> one<00:03:51.650> slot<00:03:52.010> was<00:03:52.760> on<00:03:53.050> if<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.260> just<00:03:54.380> had

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
so like one slot was on if you just had

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.440 
so like one slot was on if you just had
RAM<00:03:54.740> on<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.040> slot<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.520> would<00:03:55.640> work<00:03:55.820> but<00:03:56.330> if

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
RAM on that slot it would work but if

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.220 
RAM on that slot it would work but if
you<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.660> both<00:03:56.930> slots<00:03:57.350> on<00:03:57.710> the<00:03:59.140> wood<00:04:00.140> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
you have both slots on the wood it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.600 
you have both slots on the wood it
worked<00:04:00.470> even<00:04:01.600> with<00:04:02.600> with<00:04:02.990> us<00:04:03.260> with<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.310> I

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
worked even with with us with the I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.390 
worked even with with us with the I
tried<00:04:05.300> both<00:04:05.570> Rams<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.500> wall<00:04:06.710> on<00:04:06.890> one<00:04:07.130> slot

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
tried both Rams on that wall on one slot

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.860 
tried both Rams on that wall on one slot
and<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:08.060> worked<00:04:08.300> so<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:08.930> would<00:04:09.080> fix<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.530> too

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
and it worked so this would fix that too

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.360 
and it worked so this would fix that too
so<00:04:11.870> yeah<00:04:12.800> um<00:04:14.230> it'll<00:04:15.230> probably<00:04:15.530> work<00:04:15.710> now<00:04:16.040> your

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
so yeah um it'll probably work now your

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.729 
so yeah um it'll probably work now your
macbook<00:04:16.730> should<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.150> working<00:04:17.330> now<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.960> if<00:04:18.620> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
macbook should be working now and if it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.640 
macbook should be working now and if it
doesn't<00:04:19.010> work<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.280> could<00:04:19.430> just<00:04:19.580> check<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
doesn't work you could just check on the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.870 
doesn't work you could just check on the
internet<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.980> if<00:04:22.310> anything<00:04:22.700> like<00:04:22.850> that

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
internet and if anything like that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.430 
internet and if anything like that
doesn't<00:04:23.300> work<00:04:23.420> you<00:04:23.660> might<00:04:23.810> have<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.080> get<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.230> new

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
doesn't work you might have to get a new

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.740 
doesn't work you might have to get a new
RAM<00:04:24.710> or<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> new<00:04:25.220> logic<00:04:25.430> board<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.080> also<00:04:28.210> if<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
RAM or a new logic board and also if you

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.280 
RAM or a new logic board and also if you
have<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.590> MacBook<00:04:31.040> we<00:04:31.400> know<00:04:31.580> with<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.290> RAM

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
have a MacBook we know with the RAM

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.310 
have a MacBook we know with the RAM
soldered<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.010> motherboard<00:04:35.200> you're<00:04:36.200> gonna

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
soldered on the motherboard you're gonna

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.530 
soldered on the motherboard you're gonna
have<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> get<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> new<00:04:36.740> logic<00:04:36.919> board<00:04:37.370> because

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
have to get a new logic board because

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.410 
have to get a new logic board because
can't<00:04:39.840> change<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.480> thanks<00:04:42.480> for<00:04:42.540> watching<00:04:42.960> bye
