is<00:01:55.840> he<00:01:56.020> just<00:01:56.439> made<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.039> across<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> loop<00:01:58.000> for

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
is he just made it across the loop for

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.120 
is he just made it across the loop for
the<00:01:58.360> line<00:01:58.600> he<00:01:59.350> would<00:01:59.500> have<00:01:59.590> made<00:01:59.799> it<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.950> the

the line he would have made it to the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.090 
the line he would have made it to the
loop<00:02:00.340> would<00:02:00.880> have<00:02:01.000> lost<00:02:01.240> over<00:02:01.719> a<00:02:02.200> lap<00:02:02.619> with

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
loop would have lost over a lap with
