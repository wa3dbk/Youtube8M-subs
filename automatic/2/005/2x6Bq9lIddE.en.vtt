 printers we need to cook 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.000
 special composition and three types 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.179
 composition is acidic 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.550
 neutral and alkaline and acid it 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:55.149
 for color hp printers 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.949

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.730
 printers as well for stove us all all 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:11.630
 also alkaline composition is us for 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:16.660
 printers canon and 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.380

 for color dodge for that to us 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:31.820
 need 10 percent society 10 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.060
 cents now about the tenth 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.060
 part 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:59.330
 so 10 rosenthal jesus so pour 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.830
 it's a lot 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:25.090
 this is also a lot so 10 percent vinegar 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 more than 10 percent alcohol 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.569
 and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.069
 80 percent distilled one but i 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.120
 walked through our pharmacies and found us 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.329
 here and did yes well, somehow the day was not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 And they did not say how to buy 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.739
 make distilled water 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.220
 home conditions we need ordinary 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:07.109
 boil water three times and 80 percent 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:15.629
 distilled water well it all 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:20.329
 let's mix well this is our composition tag 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.329
 what does he do we need somehow 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:32.609
 put on katrich too i mean i am so 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 did we take a bandage and do and review 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:47.669
 small square to soak in him 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:49.919
 the solution we are doing now is to call . 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:54.859
 if we make picts for all of us 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.859
 printer, you can add it all 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.409
 are individuals irina 10 percent 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:09.470
 glycerol such 10 percent 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:12.920
 alcohol, that is, we made this 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:26.870
 further what we do need to soak in 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:32.120
 solution and we should lay down here 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.700
 a piece and we need a half to two days 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:41.500

 put on a half or two days put attacks in 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:58.870
 this solution and hayon otkisay 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.760
 if you have other printers like this movie 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.100
 we will need another 10 percent 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.530
 ammonia 10 in the spirit by ten 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.990
 percent glycerol and water but how 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.440
 hydroquinone we made and acidic 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 solution 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:20.050
