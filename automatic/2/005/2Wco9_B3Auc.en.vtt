there's a tiny dot above the air
corrector<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.930> might<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.829> able<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
corrector which I might be able to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
corrector which I might be able to
scrape<00:00:59.309> off<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.120> I'm<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.930> too<00:01:01.140> concerned

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
scrape off but I'm not too concerned

smudges articulation wise on both
figures<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> same

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
figures it's it's pretty much the same

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.170 
figures it's it's pretty much the same
it<00:01:24.630> works<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.900> little<00:01:25.020> better<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.470> think<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
it works a little better I think on the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.609 
it works a little better I think on the
war<00:01:27.180> machine<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.570> Iron<00:01:27.930> Man<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.380> um<00:01:28.880> he<00:01:29.880> has

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
war machine and Iron Man but um he has

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.149 
war machine and Iron Man but um he has
swiveling<00:01:31.619> hinged<00:01:32.159> um<00:01:33.380> ankles<00:01:34.380> they're<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
swiveling hinged um ankles they're a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.700 
swiveling hinged um ankles they're a
little<00:01:35.430> restrictive<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> because

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
little restrictive just kind of because

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.850 
little restrictive just kind of because
of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> piece<00:01:40.079> uh<00:01:40.110> that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
of the that the the piece uh that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.710 
of the that the the piece uh that
protrudes<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> top<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.329> foot

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
protrudes there from the top of the foot

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
protrudes there from the top of the foot
it<00:01:43.619> doesn't<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.100> slide<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:44.820> under

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it doesn't really slide that well under

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
it doesn't really slide that well under
the<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.380> shin<00:01:46.950> armor<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.810> there<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.960> some

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the the shin armor but there is some

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
the the shin armor but there is some
movement<00:01:49.829> there<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.490> seems<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> little

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
movement there it seems to be a little

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.859 
movement there it seems to be a little
better<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.659> foot<00:01:51.899> than<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> one

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
better on this foot than this one

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.219 
better on this foot than this one
he<00:01:54.869> has<00:01:55.079> single<00:01:55.920> hinge<00:01:56.159> dug<00:01:56.490> knees<00:01:57.079> they<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
he has single hinge dug knees they got a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
he has single hinge dug knees they got a
pretty<00:01:58.469> decent<00:01:58.530> range<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> motion<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.689> kind<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pretty decent range of motion I kind of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.060 
pretty decent range of motion I kind of
like<00:02:00.869> how<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> armor<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.590> sculpted

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
like how the armor was like sculpted

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.429 
like how the armor was like sculpted
right<00:02:02.299> right<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> joint

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
right right back in so as the joint

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.709 
right right back in so as the joint
slides<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:06.119> doesn't<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.540> hurt

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
slides in and out it doesn't really hurt

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.680 
slides in and out it doesn't really hurt
the<00:02:06.930> sculpt<00:02:07.170> too<00:02:07.320> much

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the sculpt too much

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.860 
the sculpt too much

hips<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.610> hips<00:02:18.090> um<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:19.530> Iron<00:02:20.010> Man<00:02:20.250> they

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
hips now the hips um on Iron Man they

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.190 
hips now the hips um on Iron Man they
don't<00:02:20.610> work<00:02:20.879> all<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.720> well

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
don't work all that well

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.780 
don't work all that well
just<00:02:22.500> because<00:02:22.830> kind<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> way<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.520> armor

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
just because kind of the way the armor

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.510 
just because kind of the way the armor
sculpted<00:02:24.239> here<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:25.260> tends<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.680> rub<00:02:26.220> against

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
sculpted here it tends to rub against

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.809 
sculpted here it tends to rub against
the<00:02:26.989> kind<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> side<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.709> armor<00:02:29.580> here

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
the kind of the side of the armor here

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.869 
the kind of the side of the armor here
so<00:02:30.660> um<00:02:30.989> but<00:02:31.379> if<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> kind<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.010> swivel<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
so um but if you kind of like swivel the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.979 
so um but if you kind of like swivel the
hip<00:02:33.060> around<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.800> actually<00:02:35.160> um<00:02:35.840> bend<00:02:36.840> his

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
hip around you can actually um bend his

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.420 
hip around you can actually um bend his
leg<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:37.920> rotate<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
leg up and then you just rotate it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.699 
leg up and then you just rotate it
around<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:40.230> doesn't<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.500> too<00:02:40.680> bad

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
around so and it doesn't look too bad

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.030 
around so and it doesn't look too bad
from<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> side<00:02:41.400> either<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:43.260> works<00:02:43.560> anyways

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
from the side either so it works anyways

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.140 
from the side either so it works anyways
to<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.430> him<00:02:44.580> actually<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.739> know<00:02:46.910> pulls<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to get him actually you know pulls a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.570 
to get him actually you know pulls a
little<00:02:48.390> more<00:02:48.629> dynamically<00:02:49.260> he's<00:02:50.190> got<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> nice

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
little more dynamically he's got a nice

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.280 
little more dynamically he's got a nice
ball<00:02:50.879> jointed<00:02:51.180> abdomen<00:02:52.459> works<00:02:53.459> well<00:02:54.290> he's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
ball jointed abdomen works well he's

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.410 
ball jointed abdomen works well he's
pretty<00:02:55.590> much<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.550> ball<00:02:56.879> junit<00:02:57.209> neck

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
pretty much just it is a ball junit neck

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.259 
pretty much just it is a ball junit neck
but<00:02:57.659> it's<00:02:57.810> more<00:02:58.140> or<00:02:58.200> less<00:02:58.319> kind<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> swivel

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
but it's more or less kind of a swivel

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.000 
but it's more or less kind of a swivel
it<00:03:00.269> has<00:03:00.510> some<00:03:00.720> decent<00:03:01.230> range<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:01.769> side<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
it has some decent range from side to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.520 
it has some decent range from side to
side<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.480> can't<00:03:03.690> really<00:03:03.870> bend<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.319> head

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
side but you can't really bend this head

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.890 
side but you can't really bend this head
forward<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.129> back<00:03:05.310> too<00:03:05.519> much<00:03:05.810> would<00:03:06.810> have

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
forward and back too much would have

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.330 
forward and back too much would have
been<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.230> nice<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.680> able<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.920> tilt<00:03:08.190> his

somewhere<00:04:16.259> when<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.739> opening<00:04:17.459> them<00:04:17.579> up<00:04:17.729> so

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
somewhere when I was opening them up so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.689 
somewhere when I was opening them up so
I'm<00:04:18.209> gonna<00:04:18.329> have<00:04:18.509> to<00:04:18.570> take<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> look<00:04:18.989> for<00:04:19.229> it

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
I'm gonna have to take a look for it

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.160 
I'm gonna have to take a look for it
hopefully<00:04:20.699> I<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.000> dig<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.359> up

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
hopefully I can dig it up

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.010 
hopefully I can dig it up
um<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.310> anyways<00:04:23.730> Ironman<00:04:24.570> was<00:04:24.810> pretty<00:04:25.020> cool

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
um so anyways Ironman was pretty cool

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.690 
um so anyways Ironman was pretty cool
war<00:04:28.020> machine<00:04:28.170> I<00:04:28.590> think<00:04:28.680> he<00:04:29.040> fared<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.460> little

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
war machine I think he fared a little

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.800 
war machine I think he fared a little
better<00:04:29.880> than<00:04:30.120> Iron<00:04:30.960> Man<00:04:31.170> did<00:04:32.030> his<00:04:33.030> sculpt<00:04:33.600> is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
better than Iron Man did his sculpt is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.600 
better than Iron Man did his sculpt is
uh<00:04:33.840> he's<00:04:34.680> got<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.890> little<00:04:35.100> more<00:04:35.220> detail

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
uh he's got a little more detail

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.970 
uh he's got a little more detail
happening

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
happening

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.280 
happening
the<00:04:37.980> paint<00:04:38.220> job<00:04:38.430> um<00:04:38.730> could<00:04:39.540> do<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.660> little<00:04:40.020> bit

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
the paint job um could do a little bit

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.870 
the paint job um could do a little bit
better<00:04:40.590> of<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.830> job<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.070> bringing<00:04:41.460> out<00:04:41.700> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
better of a job of bringing out the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.620 
better of a job of bringing out the
detail<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:44.130> still<00:04:44.640> really<00:04:44.910> nice<00:04:45.120> again

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
detail but it's still really nice again

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.780 
detail but it's still really nice again
the<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.290> paint<00:04:46.530> apps<00:04:46.710> on<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.040> silver<00:04:47.400> is<00:04:47.580> all

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
the the paint apps on the silver is all

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290 
the the paint apps on the silver is all
really<00:04:48.030> clean<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.920> arc<00:04:50.070> reactor<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.820> actually

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
really clean the arc reactor is actually

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.700 
really clean the arc reactor is actually
blue<00:04:51.570> on<00:04:51.750> him<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.230> just<00:04:52.620> colored<00:04:53.130> it<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.460> red<00:04:54.710> um

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
blue on him I just colored it in red um

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.020 
blue on him I just colored it in red um
you<00:04:56.160> know<00:04:56.220> just<00:04:56.370> make<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.730> little<00:04:56.820> more

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you know just make it a little more

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.880 
you know just make it a little more
accurate

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
accurate

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.350 
accurate
um<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.070> guess<00:04:59.220> one<00:04:59.430> thing<00:04:59.460> else<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.060> point<00:05:00.270> out

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
um I guess one thing else to point out

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.090 
um I guess one thing else to point out
on<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.600> Iron<00:05:00.750> Man<00:05:00.930> before<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.380> jump<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.950> war

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
on the Iron Man before I jump in the war

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.850 
on the Iron Man before I jump in the war
machine<00:05:02.370> um<00:05:02.580> on<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.720> helmet<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.350> eyes<00:05:04.530> are

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
machine um on the helmet the eyes are

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.680 
machine um on the helmet the eyes are
not<00:05:04.890> painted<00:05:05.520> they're<00:05:05.910> actually<00:05:06.240> just<00:05:06.270> gold

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
not painted they're actually just gold

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.010 
not painted they're actually just gold
just<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.740> same<00:05:07.920> as<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.130> rest<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:09.150> um<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:09.810> you

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
just the same as the rest so um if you

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540 
just the same as the rest so um if you
want<00:05:10.230> colored<00:05:10.860> eyes<00:05:10.980> you're<00:05:11.220> gonna<00:05:11.280> have<00:05:11.460> to

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
want colored eyes you're gonna have to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.120 
want colored eyes you're gonna have to
do<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.820> yourself<00:05:12.470> which<00:05:13.470> was<00:05:13.740> pretty

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
do that yourself which was pretty

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.690 
do that yourself which was pretty
disappointing<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:16.040> so<00:05:17.040> on<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> war<00:05:17.430> machine

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
disappointing but so on the war machine

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.700 
disappointing but so on the war machine
anyways<00:05:18.030> um<00:05:18.360> again<00:05:18.900> pretty<00:05:19.140> much<00:05:19.230> like<00:05:19.500> Iron

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
anyways um again pretty much like Iron

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.140 
anyways um again pretty much like Iron
Man<00:05:19.830> he<00:05:20.040> has<00:05:20.130> more<00:05:20.340> or<00:05:20.430> less<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.670> exact<00:05:20.970> same

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
Man he has more or less the exact same

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.320 
Man he has more or less the exact same
articulation<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:22.730> can't<00:05:23.730> really<00:05:23.850> think<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.180> any

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
articulation I can't really think of any

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.790 
articulation I can't really think of any
joints<00:05:24.930> he<00:05:25.140> has<00:05:25.910> over<00:05:26.910> our<00:05:26.940> Iron<00:05:27.300> Man<00:05:27.800> his

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
joints he has over our Iron Man his

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.190 
joints he has over our Iron Man his
torso<00:05:29.580> joint<00:05:30.000> here<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.360> do<00:05:30.450> believe<00:05:30.900> he<00:05:31.080> has<00:05:31.170> a

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
torso joint here I do believe he has a

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.070 
torso joint here I do believe he has a
ball<00:05:31.470> joint<00:05:31.650> though<00:05:31.950> on<00:05:32.340> mine<00:05:32.790> it's<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.540> guess

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
ball joint though on mine it's I guess

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.930 
ball joint though on mine it's I guess
it's<00:05:34.290> seized<00:05:34.770> up<00:05:34.980> or<00:05:35.220> there<00:05:35.490> isn't<00:05:35.670> one

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
it's seized up or there isn't one

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.450 
it's seized up or there isn't one
because<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.840> can't<00:05:37.530> get<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:37.920> move<00:05:38.070> anyways

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
because I can't get it to move anyways

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.540 
because I can't get it to move anyways
like<00:05:38.610> not<00:05:38.790> even<00:05:38.940> budge<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.270> little<00:05:39.420> bit<00:05:40.100> um<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
like not even budge a little bit um the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.780 
like not even budge a little bit um the
ball<00:05:42.060> jointed<00:05:42.390> neck<00:05:42.600> on<00:05:42.780> war<00:05:43.470> machine<00:05:43.740> works<00:05:44.640> a

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
ball jointed neck on war machine works a

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.880 
ball jointed neck on war machine works a
lot<00:05:44.970> better<00:05:45.030> than<00:05:45.480> iron<00:05:45.690> moon<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.440> can<00:05:46.560> see<00:05:46.770> he

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
lot better than iron moon you can see he

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.470 
lot better than iron moon you can see he
can<00:05:47.010> actually<00:05:47.370> bend<00:05:47.550> up<00:05:47.730> and<00:05:47.880> down<00:05:48.060> in<00:05:48.270> from

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
can actually bend up and down in from

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.080 
can actually bend up and down in from
side<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.720> side<00:05:49.020> so<00:05:50.960> he<00:05:51.960> also<00:05:52.110> has<00:05:52.410> the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
side to side so he also has the

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.600 
side to side so he also has the
articulated<00:05:54.090> cannon<00:05:54.480> on<00:05:54.600> his<00:05:54.720> shoulder<00:05:55.610> kind

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
articulated cannon on his shoulder kind

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.820 
articulated cannon on his shoulder kind
of<00:05:56.730> just<00:05:56.880> go<00:05:57.000> from<00:05:57.210> side<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.480> side<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:57.960> back

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
of just go from side to side and back

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.540 
of just go from side to side and back
and<00:05:59.010> forward<00:06:00.110> it's<00:06:01.110> not<00:06:01.170> too<00:06:01.440> bad<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.920> would

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
and forward it's not too bad I would

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.100 
and forward it's not too bad I would
have<00:06:02.670> been<00:06:02.760> nice<00:06:02.880> if<00:06:03.090> it<00:06:03.180> what<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.300> had<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:03.660> ammo

have been nice if it what I had the ammo

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.100 
have been nice if it what I had the ammo
belt<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.890> other<00:06:05.310> figures<00:06:05.700> have<00:06:06.110> the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
belt that the other figures have the

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.550

small one in the Walmart version his
hips<00:06:10.860> also<00:06:11.100> work<00:06:11.370> a<00:06:11.490> lot<00:06:11.520> better<00:06:11.790> you<00:06:12.180> can

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
hips also work a lot better you can

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.960 
hips also work a lot better you can
actually<00:06:12.450> pull<00:06:12.780> them<00:06:12.930> out<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.490> forward<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.700> I

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
actually pull them out and forward and I

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.420 
actually pull them out and forward and I
think<00:06:15.570> he<00:06:15.690> has<00:06:15.780> much<00:06:15.990> better<00:06:16.200> range<00:06:16.920> of<00:06:17.070> motion

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
think he has much better range of motion

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.120 
think he has much better range of motion
I<00:06:18.320> shouldn't<00:06:19.320> say<00:06:19.470> maybe<00:06:19.650> better<00:06:20.010> than

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
I shouldn't say maybe better than

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.660 
I shouldn't say maybe better than
Ironman<00:06:20.670> but<00:06:21.020> it's<00:06:22.020> a<00:06:22.170> lot<00:06:22.350> more<00:06:22.470> friendly<00:06:22.920> you

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
Ironman but it's a lot more friendly you

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.940 
Ironman but it's a lot more friendly you
don't<00:06:23.850> have<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.210> kind<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:25.140> distort<00:06:25.620> his<00:06:25.740> legs

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
don't have to kind of distort his legs

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.260 
don't have to kind of distort his legs
all<00:06:26.130> over<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.400> place<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.760> get<00:06:26.910> him<00:06:27.000> to<00:06:27.090> pull

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
all over the place to get him to pull

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.260 
all over the place to get him to pull
off<00:06:27.420> a<00:06:27.450> pose

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
off a pose

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.080 
off a pose
um<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.140> guess<00:06:30.650> another<00:06:30.980> feature<00:06:31.250> both<00:06:31.580> figures

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
um I guess another feature both figures

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:42.040 
um I guess another feature both figures
have<00:06:33.460> is<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:35.290> removable<00:06:36.290> face<00:06:36.740> masks<00:06:40.900> it<00:06:41.900> has

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
have is the removable face masks it has

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.070 
have is the removable face masks it has
a<00:06:42.080> pretty<00:06:42.410> decent<00:06:42.770> likeness<00:06:43.250> I<00:06:43.400> think<00:06:43.640> to<00:06:44.080> don

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
a pretty decent likeness I think to don

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.120 
a pretty decent likeness I think to don
cheadle<00:06:45.320> I<00:06:45.760> think<00:06:46.760> a<00:06:46.820> little<00:06:47.030> better<00:06:47.180> than<00:06:47.240> the

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
cheadle I think a little better than the

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.850 
cheadle I think a little better than the
Iron<00:06:49.130> Man's<00:06:49.490> Tony<00:06:49.820> Stark<00:06:50.210> but<00:06:50.960> and<00:06:51.590> then<00:06:51.710> the

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
Iron Man's Tony Stark but and then the

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.530 
Iron Man's Tony Stark but and then the
helmet<00:06:52.250> can<00:06:52.460> just<00:06:52.640> plug<00:06:52.790> into<00:06:52.970> the<00:06:53.120> holes<00:06:53.330> on

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
helmet can just plug into the holes on

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.500 
helmet can just plug into the holes on
the<00:06:53.660> top<00:06:53.840> of<00:06:53.990> the<00:06:54.050> head<00:06:54.200> so<00:06:55.150> it<00:06:56.150> works<00:06:56.330> pretty

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
the top of the head so it works pretty

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.810 
the top of the head so it works pretty
nicely<00:06:56.660> so<00:06:57.170> let<00:06:57.860> quick<00:06:58.220> let<00:06:58.400> you<00:06:58.550> have<00:06:58.670> a<00:06:58.700> look

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
nicely so let quick let you have a look

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:07.720 
nicely so let quick let you have a look
at<00:06:58.940> Iron<00:06:59.150> Man<00:06:59.300> as<00:06:59.450> well<00:06:59.660> I<00:07:06.490> think<00:07:07.490> it's<00:07:07.610> not

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:07.730 
at Iron Man as well I think it's not

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.670 
at Iron Man as well I think it's not
it's<00:07:07.880> not<00:07:08.000> a<00:07:08.060> bad<00:07:08.330> likeness<00:07:08.570> but<00:07:08.990> um<00:07:09.350> it's

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
it's not a bad likeness but um it's

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.640 
it's not a bad likeness but um it's
definitely<00:07:10.100> not<00:07:10.250> as<00:07:10.460> good<00:07:10.640> as<00:07:10.930> the<00:07:11.930> war

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
definitely not as good as the war

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.800 
definitely not as good as the war
machine<00:07:15.910> one<00:07:16.910> other<00:07:17.030> thing<00:07:17.210> I<00:07:17.300> don't<00:07:17.360> like<00:07:17.540> is

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
machine one other thing I don't like is

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.420 
machine one other thing I don't like is
the<00:07:17.840> the<00:07:18.440> big<00:07:18.620> holes<00:07:18.890> in<00:07:19.070> the<00:07:19.190> forehead

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
the the big holes in the forehead

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.430 
the the big holes in the forehead
they're<00:07:20.180> kind<00:07:20.390> of<00:07:20.480> hidden<00:07:20.630> off<00:07:20.900> to<00:07:21.140> the<00:07:21.230> side

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
they're kind of hidden off to the side

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.870 
they're kind of hidden off to the side
of<00:07:21.620> his<00:07:21.740> face<00:07:21.920> so<00:07:22.130> you<00:07:22.190> don't<00:07:22.250> see<00:07:22.520> him<00:07:22.610> as<00:07:22.700> much

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
of his face so you don't see him as much

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.840 
of his face so you don't see him as much
but<00:07:23.810> him<00:07:24.050> they're<00:07:24.230> kind<00:07:24.440> of<00:07:24.500> right<00:07:25.250> smack<00:07:25.580> dab

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
but him they're kind of right smack dab

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.980 
but him they're kind of right smack dab
in<00:07:26.060> the<00:07:26.090> middle<00:07:26.180> saw<00:07:27.880> but<00:07:28.880> when<00:07:29.480> you<00:07:29.600> do<00:07:29.750> have

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
in the middle saw but when you do have

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.140 
in the middle saw but when you do have
the<00:07:30.200> helmet<00:07:30.920> on<00:07:31.040> top<00:07:31.250> it's<00:07:31.520> not<00:07:31.670> so<00:07:31.820> bad<00:07:31.970> you

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150 
the helmet on top it's not so bad you

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.960 
the helmet on top it's not so bad you
don't<00:07:32.300> really<00:07:32.390> see<00:07:32.630> them<00:07:32.860> so<00:07:36.340> anyway<00:07:37.340> some<00:07:37.400> I

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 
don't really see them so anyway some I

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.590 
don't really see them so anyway some I
got<00:07:38.690> I<00:07:38.750> got<00:07:38.990> each<00:07:39.140> one<00:07:39.320> for<00:07:39.500> about<00:07:39.650> $20<00:07:40.250> a<00:07:40.280> pop

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
got I got each one for about $20 a pop

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.240 
got I got each one for about $20 a pop
so<00:07:41.600> um<00:07:41.960> I<00:07:42.260> would<00:07:42.590> definitely<00:07:42.620> say<00:07:43.070> they're

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.250 
so um I would definitely say they're

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.570 
so um I would definitely say they're
worth<00:07:43.400> the<00:07:43.520> money<00:07:44.590> if<00:07:45.590> you<00:07:45.950> could<00:07:46.160> pick<00:07:46.400> up<00:07:46.520> the

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.580 
worth the money if you could pick up the

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.640 
worth the money if you could pick up the
the<00:07:46.760> Walmart<00:07:47.720> versions<00:07:48.110> you<00:07:48.260> might<00:07:48.410> want<00:07:48.590> to

the Walmart versions you might want to

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.850 
the Walmart versions you might want to
skip<00:07:48.770> these<00:07:49.100> but<00:07:49.940> I<00:07:50.480> was<00:07:51.050> still<00:07:51.230> happy<00:07:51.440> picking

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860
