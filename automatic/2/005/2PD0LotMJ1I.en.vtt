00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
drops people pretty much quicker and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.640 
drops people pretty much quicker and
drops<00:04:58.120> people<00:04:58.390> quicker<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.870> reckon<00:04:59.350> it's<00:04:59.470> got<00:04:59.620> a

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
drops people quicker I reckon it's got a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.070 
drops people quicker I reckon it's got a
larger<00:05:00.280> clip<00:05:00.790> then<00:05:01.090> like<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.480> scorpions

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
larger clip then like the scorpions

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.230 
larger clip then like the scorpions
though<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.590> scorpions<00:05:03.040> have<00:05:03.160> no<00:05:03.520> recoil<00:05:04.000> now

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
though the scorpions have no recoil now

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.350 
though the scorpions have no recoil now
if<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.960> get<00:05:05.110> up<00:05:05.260> close<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.590> personal<00:05:05.830> with

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
if you get up close and personal with

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.030 
if you get up close and personal with
against<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.450> scorpions<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.050> fmg9<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
against the scorpions and fmg9 so the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.470 
against the scorpions and fmg9 so the
fmg9<00:05:09.460> zar<00:05:09.820> probably<00:05:10.090> going<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.330> win<00:05:10.450> because

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
fmg9 zar probably going to win because

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.210 
fmg9 zar probably going to win because
they<00:05:10.840> just<00:05:11.050> shoot<00:05:11.200> so<00:05:11.410> much<00:05:11.440> faster<00:05:11.830> and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
they just shoot so much faster and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.950 
they just shoot so much faster and
there's<00:05:12.760> so<00:05:12.850> much<00:05:13.000> more<00:05:13.180> ammo<00:05:13.419> in<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.720> clip

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
there's so much more ammo in the clip

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.190 
there's so much more ammo in the clip
now<00:05:14.830> that's<00:05:15.370> why<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.640> reckon<00:05:16.210> fmg<00:05:16.780> lines<00:05:16.990> are<00:05:17.169> a

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
now that's why I reckon fmg lines are a

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.530 
now that's why I reckon fmg lines are a
bit<00:05:17.410> more<00:05:18.000> overpowered<00:05:19.000> than<00:05:19.150> any<00:05:19.300> other

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
bit more overpowered than any other

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.330 
bit more overpowered than any other
secondary<00:05:20.140> like<00:05:20.380> I<00:05:20.590> don't<00:05:20.890> know<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.100> guys

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
secondary like I don't know you guys

fmg9 s but you know what are you going
to<00:05:25.240> do<00:05:25.360> like<00:05:25.570> everyone<00:05:25.870> else<00:05:26.020> uses<00:05:26.380> them<00:05:26.700> you

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
to do like everyone else uses them you

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.100 
to do like everyone else uses them you
got<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:27.940> play<00:05:28.090> on<00:05:28.240> their<00:05:28.390> level<00:05:28.570> until<00:05:28.930> they

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
got to play on their level until they

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.570 
got to play on their level until they
patch<00:05:29.410> them<00:05:29.590> to<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> point<00:05:30.100> where<00:05:30.250> you<00:05:30.340> can't

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
patch them to the point where you can't

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.450 
patch them to the point where you can't
use<00:05:30.850> them<00:05:31.030> which<00:05:31.290> which<00:05:32.290> maybe<00:05:32.830> they<00:05:33.070> might<00:05:33.280> do

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
use them which which maybe they might do

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.040 
use them which which maybe they might do
but<00:05:33.669> knowing<00:05:33.880> Infinity<00:05:34.390> Ward<00:05:34.630> they<00:05:34.780> probably

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
but knowing Infinity Ward they probably

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.300 
but knowing Infinity Ward they probably
won't<00:05:35.440> because<00:05:35.710> they<00:05:35.830> said<00:05:36.010> they're<00:05:36.130> already

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
won't because they said they're already

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.460 
won't because they said they're already
patched<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.210> am<00:05:37.419> really<00:05:37.690> done<00:05:37.990> much<00:05:38.020> about

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
patched and I am really done much about

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.260 
patched and I am really done much about
it<00:05:38.650> but<00:05:38.800> yeah<00:05:39.550> I<00:05:39.580> don't<00:05:39.820> know<00:05:39.880> what<00:05:40.060> are<00:05:40.120> your
