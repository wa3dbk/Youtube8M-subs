and you have to play the game while it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.680 
and you have to play the game while it's
on<00:03:01.709> when<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.310> trying<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.640> explain<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.480> game

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690

to me it's really annoying but what can

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.590 
to me it's really annoying but what can
you<00:03:07.709> do<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.400> Thomas<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> middle<00:03:09.450> line

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
you do so Thomas is in the middle line

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.590 
you do so Thomas is in the middle line
it's<00:03:10.079> always<00:03:10.290> nice<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.500> see<00:03:11.000> Jenna<00:03:12.000> there's

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
although the phone call did give me like

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.300 
although the phone call did give me like
a<00:03:24.870> bit<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.230> Rage<00:03:25.410> deep<00:03:25.739> down<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.709> this

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a bit of Rage deep down so this
