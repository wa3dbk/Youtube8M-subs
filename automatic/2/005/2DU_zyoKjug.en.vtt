00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi friends yes this is a movie about world of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.819
 tanks on my channel 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.130
 never understood those people who 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 watered something shit themselves don't count not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.210
 passed but oh well I'll tell you what 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.700
 is this a game and is it worth it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 amounts of insults since i 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.560
 always objective and if you think that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 I pour water with shit then by no means 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 There are lots of other games and a variety of them. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.060
 the background is still nothing but it is home tirsk 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.310
 shooter but this is how business works in the cis and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 easier for people to download and play with donatti 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 frame than spend 40 bucks on the battles or 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 call of duty to play on the balance here the most 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 funny that these people will be humiliated 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.219
 schoolchildren what's there and that's why they 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.079
 just don't want to throw away 40 dollars 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 ok cho you walked away from the topic in short 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.700
 never played world of tanks and knowing 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.730
 what does it give risk and shit tanks for 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.219
 than the ray and other slogan and the first thing 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.050
 I want to start this community I thought that 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 here I will cover known 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.719
 reproductive organs, or worse yet 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 there is really a community from 7 years to 70 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.619
 come across to me when he and schoolchildren so 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.810
 and adults because from the first minute 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.390
 I play mixed feelings and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 that's what truth disgusts me 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 I'll show you now 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.020
 I go into the game and here you immediately first 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.930
 cause of annoyance when you travel 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.840
 by studying the menu is all that's annoying and 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 this is actually having studied the game i 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 I chose a tank and drove me into battle noob and how 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.570
 would choose by appearance and by country 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.180
 I pressed the button to the battle and waited a little 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.340
 I saw somehow style tanks on others 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.320
 channels showed how many fps gives out 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 This game is what kind of graphics card 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.439
 do i need a processor for them 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 it seemed terribly creepy 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.110
 demanding game though texture me 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.479
 somewhere in 2009 until here is not the most 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 advanced grafon but here is what 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.549
 not enough for most games 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.790
 I 'm talking about the atmosphere that is what 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.790
 I mean, a field or a battlefield is done. 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.040
 very nice where to hide there is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.979
 where to ride well until you were killed 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 naturally but generally very interesting and 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.770
 very elaborate made these here 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.590
 cards 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.990
 And now a few words about the gameplay if 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.110
 someone played it first most likely 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.180
 climbed him killed seconds in 30 then 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.240
 from the back of the mouth argued that all noobs 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.640
 he king removed the game and started watering 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.370
 her shit somewhere in public or in 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.980
 comments on youtube but then I turned 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.050
 brains and realized that you do not need to climb 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.660
 and you need to wait neatly while my 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.180
 enemies with one bend will go to me and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.120
 what do you think of me like this 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.120
 hit his first tank then played another 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.790
 I didnâ€™t understand a couple of games . 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 why do we play that game so shit well 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.280
 Yes, I understand Donat is a worthy reason 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.920
 But who if anyone to donat here for 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.350
 a piece of bucks i got fanny threw none 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.380
 pennies like or think hundreds and thousands 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.840
 players around the world after an accident with 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.720
 friends to play this even interesting 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.210
 purely for a change what is the result guys 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.670
 write the cons you see in this 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.100
 the game for myself, I singled out only one and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.040
 It is natural Donat and so very 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.380
 not a bad fritupley you have no money and you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 want to protest something new come in 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.900
 in the world of tanks, why exactly 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.210
 no tell me what tanks play cattle 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 no talk but honestly there is a cattle 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.100
 in any game just somewhere more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.340
