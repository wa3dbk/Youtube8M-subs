 the vienna lovers please again 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.329
 a bit by tram 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.640

 Lines courses made that you at 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:42.780
 keep the speed and not me 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:45.299
 say it reluctantly but as some turn 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.210
 Of course, people mean you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.360
 to think we'll just drive times 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.390
 instead of 50 ministers, there are 80 with the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.479
 tram or bus also 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.720
 Of course, please stick to the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.860
 Traffic rules The Stvo is your friend 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.380
 and helper already tries you in 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.530
 in front of a control center and shares 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 do this by putting that in front of your name 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.959
 So write abc or d 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.209
 what I mean by that you will find again 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.700
 here in the time as I think I am talking 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.900
 I'll make a picture of it 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.700
 there you see him or him yes if that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.459
 picture does not work then you see 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 below again a link to it because you have to 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.550
 choose the control center and yes 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.640
 then you really need yours 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.350
 own number and look for the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 perfect attitude out for the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.760
 ears so that it is fluid playable 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.970
 and be sure with one 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.690
 Internet connection on the safe side 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.269
 because it is so this time so who flies once 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.920
 because you do not believe even if he does 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.060
 again the truth speaks such a kind 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.829
 I have that is a bit free 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.910
 motor pronounced 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.240
 it is so 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.360
 We think it is a come one 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.820
 bigger rush and that is then 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.090
 it's difficult to get a bit on track 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.740
 keep or even everything to plan 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.270
 so be careful that yours 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.700
 Internet connection stable in any case 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.100
 be careful that you then for the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.350
