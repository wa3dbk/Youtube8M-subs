00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.440
 answer a question that many of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 You left past videos and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
 was also one of the outstanding questions 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 from that video I did for work 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 which I thought deserved a video 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.660
 talking about it and the question is that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.180
 course I need to do to become the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.039
 illustrator or comic strip then 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.039
 know the answer is still in the video 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.230
 It's good to start the video I wanted. 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.260
 To say that I've been in your place I 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 I was a young girl who liked very much 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.190
 to draw and that I dream of achieving 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.699
 live from my drawings 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.690
 so I guess who likes to draw 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.400
 who likes to do anything 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.850
 related to arts 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.370
 some already wondered how to do this 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.250
 how to become a illustrator draftsman 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.979
 the cartoonist or whatever 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.170
 I've already been in your shoes and I already 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.810
 I was confused not knowing if it was really 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.150
 What I wanted to do is suffer the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 pressure from the very society of our 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 family members in the expectation that they 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.080
 we had to go to college and 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.420
 form and be someone in life so I 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.210
 I think that's the way I would like to have it. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.430
 watched a video or chatted with 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.220
 someone who could say go back there 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.070
 When I had these doubts then I think 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.200
 that this video also goes to Mariana 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.409
 the past and for all the people who 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.999
 one day feeling insecure and would like 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.920
 of having a path there to hold a light 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.749
 to know that it is possible to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.539
 This is what concerns me about the 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:52.509
 truth is all youth in general 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.340
 even at the start, but it was only 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.079
 perceived later, usually the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.939
 We really put our heads and 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.579
 people put our heads that the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.289
 college will solve our life and the 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.719
 truth is not quite so 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.310
 Of course college was a 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.289
 very important thing for me in my 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 life I learned a lot from an experience 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.090
 very rich and if you are interested in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.920
 know more about my experience in the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.750
 my visual arts course and do not put 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 the video here I speak a little 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.650
 about my course and my experience 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.300
 So you can go there and see this video is 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.650
 So it's clear that college was 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.050
 very important but only after a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.209
 time I realized that it does not define the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.209
 What are you going to do? What are you going to do? 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.550
 for the rest of your life and may be 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.560
 not that you do the same thing for 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.719
 solve your life that you change 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.579
 teacher you do things 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.459
 so I think it's important that you 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.430
 are you at school are you graduating in 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.519
 high school that's there choosing a 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.870
 course in college think it is not 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.969
 definitive 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.489
 it's not a thing you'll ever go 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.859
 you can go back and it is not a choice 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.469
 which will bring terrible consequences 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.540
 in case you do not choose first is 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.700
 that you wanted to do things 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.129
 not so I know it may seem on the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.139
 it is the principle that is the choice of your life 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.030
 but the truth is not this and I wanted it 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.829
 You know that you do not have much. 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.620
 sure you want to do 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.980
 I had a year of your life to study 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.780
 do work travel 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.730
 exchange anything because when 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.609
 Are you going back to college? 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.340
 waiting and you can decide if you 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.849
 whether or not you choose from each 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.730
 one 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.950
 Let's finally get the answer that you 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.370
 both wanted to know what course to do for 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.049
 to become an illustrator and comic strip 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.479
 technically do not need to be trained 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.659
 in nothing for you to become the illustrator 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.459
 and actually in this area 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.560
 The most important thing is that you have a 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.040
 portfolio is you show to people 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.530
 that you do not know how to do is also very 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.299
 common that people and areas make 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.989
 self-taught herself on account of 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:05.389
 owning other types of courses is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.519
 was there to take a shorter course a 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:10.159
 course more focused on what you 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.599
 whether it is not as high as the 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.479
 college course you will not 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.289
 stay four years only study all that 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:20.539
 when you have a very objective goal 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.849
 in your life so the paths are 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.210
 several exist are path and you do not 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:28.400
 needs to be accurately formed in some 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.229
 thing to be an illustrator to people who 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.620
 They are going to hire or am not worried 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.050
 if you are to form one place to another or only 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.430
 They want to know if you can solve it. 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.009
 what they need if you 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.020
 can make an illustration that is 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.990
 exactly what they are looking for and 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.400
 I particularly think that there are 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.270
 some things that you only learn in 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.110
 maybe college practice can 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.560
 open many a way 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.390
 And do you know people who take it? 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.930
 take the job market is the 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.870
 important factor you are inserted in the 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.330
 where people already have a certain 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 experience and will be 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.420
 environment too 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.330
 so in that sense I think it's very 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.520
 interesting professionally but it is not 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.100
 The only way I said it, I think 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.000
 the most important thing in this is you 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.950
 always want to get over you always 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.430
 is looking for a better person 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.770
 even and looking to evolve 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.670
 professionally evolve your techniques 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.080
 luiz his theoretical knowledge is this 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.820
 is an important factor that will 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.850
 influence your work directly 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.110
 in the result because you are doing 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.270
 I think this is independent of any 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.430
 The course that you make I think this 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.270
 Can you two be going to college? 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.610
 doing is a technical course and is not 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.970
 depends on the course depends on you then 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.010
 I think the most important is you are 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:58.430
 figure out what you want to do what 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.440
 Do you want to make and run after looking? 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.650
 professionals who already work with this 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.140
 Catch tips Know what they have What 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.570
 they have to say is contact 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.940
 these people get in touch with who 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.010
 is already in the job market send 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.860
 Portfolio for these people send 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.170
 resume and letter do things 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.270
 roll so I think so I 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:24.230
 I tried to answer this question the best 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.510
 without getting stuck here 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.670
 rule for you saying that it has to be 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.400
 this way or it does not have to be from another 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.740
 The way it does not exist I 'd be 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.830
 if he said that there is only one 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.500
 and it exists in some things I think 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:43.310
 that people only learn by living then 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.740
 you decide something will try 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.410
 do you will never know if you do not 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.510
 this is basically what I had 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.850
 pleasure to you guys, you still have 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.510
 doubts about this about any other 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.610
 thing 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.260
