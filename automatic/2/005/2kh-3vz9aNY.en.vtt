not<00:02:09.320> as<00:02:09.500> smooth<00:02:09.890> as<00:02:10.220> other<00:02:10.729> two<00:02:10.940> cars<00:02:11.209> it's<00:02:11.750> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
not as smooth as other two cars it's a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:22.640 
not as smooth as other two cars it's a
nice<00:02:12.050> car<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:13.340> well<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.270> big<00:02:14.420> w

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.500 

well<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> audit<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.819> well-balanced<00:02:25.390> car

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
well the audit it is a well-balanced car

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.839 
well the audit it is a well-balanced car
so<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.050> cannot<00:02:26.440> really<00:02:26.739> find<00:02:27.220> weak<00:02:27.580> or

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
so you cannot really find weak or

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.589 
so you cannot really find weak or
extreme<00:02:28.629> good<00:02:29.349> points<00:02:29.830> about<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.420> which<00:02:31.420> is

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
extreme good points about that which is

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.660 
extreme good points about that which is
good<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.989> which<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.290> also<00:02:32.470> bad<00:02:32.860> somebody

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
good and which is also bad somebody

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
good and which is also bad somebody
would<00:02:33.819> say<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.599> boring<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.560> will<00:02:35.980> say

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
would say it's boring but I will say

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.040 
would say it's boring but I will say
it's<00:02:36.519> it's<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.060> well-balanced<00:02:37.540> car<00:02:37.629> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
it's it's a well-balanced car is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.680 
it's it's a well-balanced car is
probably<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.250> most<00:02:39.610> boring<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> three

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
probably the most boring of the three

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.809 
probably the most boring of the three
cars<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.620> at<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.830> same<00:02:41.980> time<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.550> quite

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
cars but at the same time it is quite

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.979 
cars but at the same time it is quite
competent<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.880> at<00:02:46.150> least<00:02:46.420> by<00:02:46.750> my

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
competent and it is at least by my

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.890 
competent and it is at least by my
opinion<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.220> car<00:02:48.489> which<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:49.569> which<00:02:49.750> you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
opinion the car which with which you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.110 
opinion the car which with which you
cannot<00:02:50.200> miss<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.830> course<00:02:51.069> still<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:52.000> as

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
cannot miss but of course still not as

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.360 
cannot miss but of course still not as
good<00:02:52.330> as<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.590> Mercedes

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
good as as the Mercedes

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.300 
good as as the Mercedes
I<00:02:54.400> think<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> Audi<00:02:55.209> q5<00:02:55.799> stands<00:02:56.799> out<00:02:56.980> really

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
I think the Audi q5 stands out really

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.900 
I think the Audi q5 stands out really
good<00:02:57.580> considering<00:02:58.420> its<00:02:58.720> age<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.400> nice<00:03:00.549> car

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
good considering its age it's a nice car

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.780 
good considering its age it's a nice car

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
but though in this car that I drove some

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.479 
but though in this car that I drove some
of<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:04.090> interior<00:03:04.780> things<00:03:05.739> were<00:03:05.980> not<00:03:06.160> really

to drive to drive fast it's not a sports

to drive to drive fast it's not a sports
car<00:03:45.140> I<00:03:45.260> think<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> BMW<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.280> more<00:03:46.520> sporty<00:03:46.970> more

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
car I think the BMW is more sporty more

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.480 
car I think the BMW is more sporty more
direct<00:03:47.900> well<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.830> first<00:03:49.070> thing<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
direct well the first thing that is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.380 
direct well the first thing that is
obvious<00:03:49.640> is<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.120> it's<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.660> new<00:03:50.810> car<00:03:51.200> it's

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
obvious is that it's a new car it's

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.090 
obvious is that it's a new car it's
road-holding<00:03:53.390> it's<00:03:53.890> practically<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.010> best

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
road-holding it's practically the best

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.230 
road-holding it's practically the best
it's<00:03:55.960> very<00:03:56.960> comfortable<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.370> inside<00:03:58.910> looks

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
it's very comfortable the inside looks

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.540 
it's very comfortable the inside looks
the<00:03:59.480> most<00:03:59.630> prestigious<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.740> all<00:04:01.040> three<00:04:01.310> cars

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
the most prestigious of all three cars

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.490 
the most prestigious of all three cars
so<00:04:01.820> it's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.510> would<00:04:02.870> say<00:04:03.020> that<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:03.320> at<00:04:03.470> least

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
so it's a I would say that it's at least

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.740 
so it's a I would say that it's at least
and<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:03.920> half<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.370> step<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.790> ahead<00:04:05.630> of

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
and a half a step in ahead of

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.400 
and a half a step in ahead of
competition

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
competition

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.030 
competition
I<00:04:06.550> think<00:04:07.550> it's<00:04:07.670> little<00:04:07.820> bit<00:04:07.970> shame<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.480> they

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
I think it's little bit shame that they

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.060 
I think it's little bit shame that they
have<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.250> fake<00:04:10.880> exhaust<00:04:11.840> pipes<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.890> rear

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
have this fake exhaust pipes in the rear

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.280 
have this fake exhaust pipes in the rear
that's<00:04:13.760> not<00:04:13.970> worthy<00:04:14.270> of<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.750> commercial

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
that's not worthy of the commercial

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.650 
that's not worthy of the commercial
expense<00:04:15.620> but<00:04:16.340> it's<00:04:16.850> nice<00:04:17.060> family<00:04:18.019> SUV
