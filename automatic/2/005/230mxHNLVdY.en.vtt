a<00:02:13.260> good<00:02:13.560> set<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.800> macros<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.790> fat<00:02:15.090> carbs

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a good set of macros for fat carbs

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.440 
a good set of macros for fat carbs
protein<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.430> sour<00:02:17.430> results<00:02:17.819> I'm<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.150> 40

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
protein and sour results I'm like 40

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.660 
protein and sour results I'm like 40
pounds<00:02:18.660> lighter<00:02:19.020> putting<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.099> that<00:02:20.459> thing

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
pounds lighter putting up that thing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
almost the same lifting almost the same

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
almost the same lifting almost the same
and<00:02:23.130> even<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.700> than<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and even more than when I was like the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.720 
and even more than when I was like the
same<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.349> saintly<00:02:25.680> same<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.069> me<00:02:26.220> guys<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:26.640> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
same a saintly same with me guys when I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
same a saintly same with me guys when I
was<00:02:26.880> 2<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.349> 20<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> 30<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> only<00:02:29.370> thing<00:02:29.489> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
was 2 like to 20 to 30 the only thing I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.979 
was 2 like to 20 to 30 the only thing I
was<00:02:29.790> really<00:02:30.090> stronger<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.630> was<00:02:30.750> bench

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
was really stronger at was bench

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.540 
was really stronger at was bench
pressing<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.830> only<00:02:32.069> reason<00:02:32.370> why<00:02:32.489> is

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
pressing and the only reason why is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.160 
pressing and the only reason why is
because<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.150> training<00:02:33.450> at<00:02:33.630> two<00:02:33.780> times<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because I was training at two times a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.680 
because I was training at two times a
week<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.060> focusing

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
week and I was pretty much just focusing

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.180 
week and I was pretty much just focusing
on<00:02:36.780> bench<00:02:37.020> pressing<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.470> didn't<00:02:37.739> train<00:02:38.010> my

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
on bench pressing I didn't train my

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.210 
on bench pressing I didn't train my
delos<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.850> hard<00:02:39.300> core<00:02:39.569> or<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:40.019> squat<00:02:40.680> hard<00:02:40.950> core

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
delos a hard core or my squat hard core

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.210 
delos a hard core or my squat hard core
so<00:02:42.000> my<00:02:42.360> pressing<00:02:42.780> was<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.140> strong<00:02:43.440> but<00:02:43.950> how

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
so my pressing was really strong but how

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.630 
so my pressing was really strong but how
for<00:02:44.489> pound<00:02:44.700> I'm<00:02:45.000> stronger<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.340> I'm<00:02:47.340> Way

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
for pound I'm stronger now and I'm Way

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.479 
for pound I'm stronger now and I'm Way
stronger<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:48.959> Delavan<00:02:49.500> squat<00:02:49.830> even<00:02:50.280> being

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
stronger on my Delavan squat even being

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.420 
stronger on my Delavan squat even being
at<00:02:50.819> bodybuilding<00:02:51.600> fat<00:02:52.260> percentage

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
at bodybuilding fat percentage

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.340 
at bodybuilding fat percentage
you<00:02:53.670> know<00:02:53.760> contest<00:02:54.269> pretty<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.720> staged<00:02:55.019> lean

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
you know contest pretty much staged lean

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.140 
you know contest pretty much staged lean
right<00:02:55.620> now<00:02:55.769> I'm<00:02:56.340> lifting<00:02:56.610> more<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
right now I'm lifting more on the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.120 
right now I'm lifting more on the
deadlift<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.049> squat<00:02:58.410> than<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.709> was<00:02:58.890> when<00:02:59.040> I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
deadlift and the squat than I was when I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.300 
deadlift and the squat than I was when I
was<00:02:59.220> 220<00:03:00.090> 230<00:03:00.540> at<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.110> 25<00:03:01.560> percent<00:03:01.830> body<00:03:02.190> fat

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
was 220 230 at like 25 percent body fat

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.300 
was 220 230 at like 25 percent body fat
so<00:03:02.959> tracking<00:03:03.959> macros<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.920> definitely

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
so tracking macros is definitely

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.400 
so tracking macros is definitely
important<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.120> lean<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:06.720> when

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
important when you get this lean on when

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.340 
important when you get this lean on when
you're<00:03:07.560> bulking<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.220> would<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:08.970> try<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.780> keep

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
you're bulking I would just try to keep

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.130 
you're bulking I would just try to keep

and the carb intake I mean it's just

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.840 
and the carb intake I mean it's just
depends<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.920> who<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.190> are<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.430> mean<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:20.760> you

you if you wanted to get super shredded
that<00:04:34.600> you've<00:04:34.870> got<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.110> start<00:04:35.290> tracking<00:04:35.590> macros

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
that you've got to start tracking macros

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370 
that you've got to start tracking macros
and<00:04:36.639> your<00:04:36.760> fat<00:04:37.000> intake<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.630> your<00:04:37.780> calorie<00:04:38.169> and

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
and your fat intake and your calorie and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.350 
and your fat intake and your calorie and
take<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> certain<00:04:38.950> at<00:04:39.280> certain<00:04:39.639> point<00:04:39.880> yeah

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
take a certain at certain point yeah

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.790 
take a certain at certain point yeah
what<00:04:40.720> point<00:04:40.930> would<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.139> be<00:04:41.440> really

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
what point would that be really

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.290 
what point would that be really
important<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.250> think<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.790> what<00:04:42.940> percent

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
important to think like what percent

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.110 
important to think like what percent
body<00:04:43.330> fat<00:04:43.800> like<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:45.010> seven<00:04:45.580> or<00:04:45.610> eight<00:04:45.880> eight

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
body fat like think seven or eight eight

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.940 
body fat like think seven or eight eight
percent<00:04:46.540> for<00:04:46.720> me<00:04:46.840> probably<00:04:47.290> they<00:04:47.440> can<00:04:47.620> start

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
percent for me probably they can start

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.070 
percent for me probably they can start
really<00:04:48.070> well<00:04:48.760> actually<00:04:48.970> know<00:04:49.240> maybe<00:04:49.930> like

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
really well actually know maybe like

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.159 
really well actually know maybe like
yeah<00:04:50.290> eight<00:04:50.830> or<00:04:50.980> nine<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.900> when<00:04:53.050> you're

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
yeah eight or nine so so when you're

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.600 
yeah eight or nine so so when you're
bulking<00:04:53.380> up<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:53.980> make<00:04:54.160> sure<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.430> go<00:04:54.580> over

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
bulking up just make sure you go over

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.150 
bulking up just make sure you go over
caloric<00:04:55.270> intake<00:04:55.630> getting<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.290> know<00:04:56.410> you<00:04:57.070> know

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
caloric intake getting you know you know

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.450 
caloric intake getting you know you know
good<00:04:57.340> amount<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.610> protein<00:04:58.030> in<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:59.190> you<00:05:00.190> know<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
good amount of protein in and you know I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.580 
good amount of protein in and you know I
saw<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.669> guys<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.080> important<00:05:02.560> to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
saw that guys so it is important to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.909 
saw that guys so it is important to
track<00:05:02.860> macros<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.910> really<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.419> but<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:05.470> depends

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
track macros it really is but it depends

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.620 
track macros it really is but it depends
on<00:05:05.980> what<00:05:06.160> your<00:05:06.280> goals<00:05:06.490> are<00:05:06.730> if<00:05:07.300> you're<00:05:07.450> trying
