00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
and so what she taught me really was

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.470 
and so what she taught me really was
that<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.020> scars<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> inside<00:02:56.120> had<00:02:57.120> become

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that the scars on the inside had become

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.120 
that the scars on the inside had become
far<00:02:57.720> more<00:02:57.750> disfiguring<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.530> scars<00:02:58.770> ever<00:02:58.980> were

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
far more disfiguring the scars ever were

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.730 
far more disfiguring the scars ever were
on<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.340> outside<00:02:59.870> really<00:03:00.870> wasn't<00:03:01.080> my<00:03:01.290> physical

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
on the outside really wasn't my physical

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.680 
on the outside really wasn't my physical
appearance<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.940> was<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.210> issue<00:03:03.360> was<00:03:03.570> my

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
appearance that was the issue was my

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.910 
appearance that was the issue was my
person<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> issue

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
person that was the issue

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.460 
person that was the issue
and<00:03:05.840> granted<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> devastating

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and granted that was a devastating

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.730 
and granted that was a devastating
moment<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.540> also<00:03:09.660> very<00:03:09.780> liberating<00:03:10.500> for

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
moment but it's also very liberating for

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.500 
moment but it's also very liberating for
me<00:03:10.830> because<00:03:11.310> suddenly<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.790> put<00:03:12.000> everything<00:03:12.300> in

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
me because suddenly it put everything in

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.230 
me because suddenly it put everything in
perspective<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.340> realized<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.000> didn't

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
perspective and I realized that I didn't

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.960 
perspective and I realized that I didn't
need<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.480> figure<00:03:15.690> out<00:03:16.220> how<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.250> find<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.700> next

one we got and that is what I'm gonna
use<00:06:10.040> on<00:06:10.430> you<00:06:10.670> if<00:06:10.790> you<00:06:10.880> don't<00:06:10.970> go<00:06:11.120> to<00:06:11.180> the

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
use on you if you don't go to the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.110 
use on you if you don't go to the
bathroom<00:06:11.480> pretty<00:06:11.930> quick

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
bathroom pretty quick

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.540 
bathroom pretty quick
guess<00:06:13.780> what<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.230> went<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.680> bathroom<00:06:15.070> really

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
guess what I went to the bathroom really

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.890 
guess what I went to the bathroom really
quick<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.830> the<00:06:20.980> the<00:06:21.699> point<00:06:22.000> is<00:06:22.150> really<00:06:22.419> that<00:06:22.690> I

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
quick so the the point is really that I

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.770 
quick so the the point is really that I
think<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.229> can<00:06:23.470> motivate<00:06:23.710> patients<00:06:24.780> in

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
think you can motivate patients in

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.500 
think you can motivate patients in
different<00:06:26.250> in<00:06:27.250> different<00:06:27.580> ways<00:06:27.970> and<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.330> can

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
different in different ways and you can

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.140 
different in different ways and you can
employ<00:06:29.020> humor<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:30.460> don't<00:06:30.610> have<00:06:30.729> to<00:06:30.880> employ

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
employ humor you don't have to employ

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.830 
employ humor you don't have to employ
fear<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:33.370> don't<00:06:33.550> wish<00:06:33.760> adversity<00:06:34.300> on<00:06:34.479> anyone

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
fear you don't wish adversity on anyone

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.409 
fear you don't wish adversity on anyone
obviously<00:06:35.410> but<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.280> got<00:06:36.430> to<00:06:36.520> tell<00:06:36.669> you<00:06:36.850> I<00:06:36.880> know<00:06:37.090> a

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
obviously but I got to tell you I know a

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.510 
obviously but I got to tell you I know a
lot<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:38.020> cancer<00:06:38.530> survivors<00:06:39.040> and<00:06:39.190> I've<00:06:39.250> never

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
lot of cancer survivors and I've never

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.969 
lot of cancer survivors and I've never
met<00:06:39.790> one<00:06:40.110> who's<00:06:41.110> ever<00:06:41.290> told<00:06:41.560> me<00:06:41.740> that<00:06:41.860> they

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
met one who's ever told me that they

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.189 
met one who's ever told me that they
wish<00:06:42.220> they<00:06:42.400> didn't<00:06:42.639> have<00:06:42.729> cancer<00:06:43.000> and<00:06:43.479> the

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
wish they didn't have cancer and the

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.860 
wish they didn't have cancer and the
reason<00:06:44.560> is<00:06:44.800> is<00:06:45.040> that<00:06:45.430> it<00:06:45.850> enabled<00:06:46.330> them<00:06:46.479> to

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
reason is is that it enabled them to

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.129 
reason is is that it enabled them to
reflect<00:06:47.169> to<00:06:47.620> reevaluate<00:06:48.360> reassess<00:06:49.360> to
