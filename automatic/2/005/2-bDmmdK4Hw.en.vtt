so you got to a quick D in there so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.940 
so you got to a quick D in there so
you're<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> seat<00:01:49.370> it's<00:01:50.370> really<00:01:51.360> quick<00:01:51.570> just

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
you're on a seat it's really quick just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.610 
you're on a seat it's really quick just
and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.730> back<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.910> an<00:01:54.180> E<00:01:54.360> minor<00:01:54.620> down

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
and then you go back to an E minor down

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.230 
and then you go back to an E minor down
on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> west<00:01:56.400> coast<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.000> could

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
on the west coast I get this it I could

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:10.470 
on the west coast I get this it I could
happen<00:02:00.890> that's<00:02:01.890> why

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.940 

but<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.230> second<00:02:12.530> time<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.800> don't

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
but that like the second time you don't

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.100 
but that like the second time you don't
do<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.280> indeed<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.540> scene<00:02:14.810> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
do that indeed it's just a scene and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.180 
do that indeed it's just a scene and
then<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.709> go<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.940> pre-chorus<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.190> you're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
then you go to the pre-chorus and you're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.750 
then you go to the pre-chorus and you're
feeling<00:02:19.610> hotter<00:02:19.880> than<00:02:20.270> show<00:02:20.540> I'm<00:02:20.959> feeling

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.600 

miss<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.239> much

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.380 

so<00:02:31.610> that's<00:02:31.879> just<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.300> minor<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:33.700> see<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.180> then

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so that's just a minor we see and then

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.940 
so that's just a minor we see and then
go<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.650> me<00:02:36.980> again<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.950> your
