poster<00:00:06.109> ideas<00:00:07.330> some<00:00:08.330> people<00:00:08.630> may<00:00:08.750> think<00:00:08.780> that

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
poster ideas some people may think that

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.890 
poster ideas some people may think that
every<00:00:09.920> idea<00:00:10.099> is<00:00:10.429> a<00:00:10.460> good<00:00:10.700> poster<00:00:11.090> idea<00:00:11.389> they

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
every idea is a good poster idea they

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.680 
every idea is a good poster idea they
have<00:00:12.309> some<00:00:13.309> have<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.549> good<00:00:13.730> time<00:00:13.969> a<00:00:14.000> good<00:00:14.420> place

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
have some have a good time a good place

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.200 
have some have a good time a good place
but<00:00:15.559> they<00:00:15.710> all<00:00:15.860> basically<00:00:16.100> should<00:00:16.699> have<00:00:16.880> the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
but they all basically should have the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.189 
but they all basically should have the
same<00:00:17.420> components<00:00:17.840> as<00:00:18.230> far<00:00:18.439> as<00:00:18.590> design<00:00:19.010> goes

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
same components as far as design goes

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.040 
same components as far as design goes
format<00:00:21.199> could<00:00:22.100> vary<00:00:22.400> some<00:00:22.880> do<00:00:23.150> large

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
format could vary some do large

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.550 
format could vary some do large
horizontal<00:00:24.410> wider<00:00:25.340> photos<00:00:26.080> some<00:00:27.080> do<00:00:27.260> tall

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
horizontal wider photos some do tall

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.939 
horizontal wider photos some do tall
skinny<00:00:28.570> formats<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:30.410> can<00:00:30.560> do<00:00:30.710> them<00:00:30.859> on

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
skinny formats you can do them on

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.190 
skinny formats you can do them on
various<00:00:31.250> different<00:00:31.670> stock<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.960> could<00:00:33.080> be

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
various different stock it could be

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.050 
various different stock it could be
glossy<00:00:33.470> stock<00:00:33.770> they<00:00:34.280> could<00:00:34.490> be<00:00:34.640> lit<00:00:34.850> from

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
glossy stock they could be lit from

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.210 
glossy stock they could be lit from
behind<00:00:35.270> they<00:00:35.870> could<00:00:36.110> just<00:00:36.290> be<00:00:36.440> plastered<00:00:37.040> on<00:00:37.190> a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
behind they could just be plastered on a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.030 
behind they could just be plastered on a
wall<00:00:37.520> but<00:00:38.480> again<00:00:38.900> they<00:00:39.110> all<00:00:39.260> should<00:00:39.590> encompass

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
wall but again they all should encompass

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.240 
wall but again they all should encompass
the<00:00:40.430> same<00:00:40.670> design<00:00:41.150> parameters<00:00:42.070> whether<00:00:43.070> it's

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
the same design parameters whether it's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.000 
the same design parameters whether it's
black<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:43.730> white<00:00:43.880> or<00:00:44.090> color<00:00:44.620> black<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.830> white

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
black and white or color black and white

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.040 
black and white or color black and white
has<00:00:46.490> different<00:00:46.940> shades<00:00:47.240> of<00:00:47.510> black<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:47.990> white

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
has different shades of black and white

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.590 
has different shades of black and white
so<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.560> can<00:00:48.800> play<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.400> sort<00:00:49.880> of<00:00:50.000> against<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
so you can play that sort of against the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.960 
so you can play that sort of against the
color<00:00:52.510> text<00:00:53.510> obviously<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.260> important<00:00:54.970> but

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
color text obviously is important but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.060 
color text obviously is important but
sometimes<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.750> most<00:00:56.900> important<00:00:57.500> thing<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.920> an

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
sometimes the most important thing is an

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.440 
sometimes the most important thing is an
image<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.730> good<00:00:59.480> strong<00:00:59.780> image<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.290> draw<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.560> in

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
image a good strong image to draw you in

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.810 
image a good strong image to draw you in
this<00:01:02.450> can<00:01:02.690> vary<00:01:03.260> based<00:01:03.770> on<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.519> different

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
this can vary based on the the different

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.760 
this can vary based on the the different
type<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.000> content<00:01:05.360> that's<00:01:05.810> in<00:01:06.080> there<00:01:06.320> if<00:01:06.560> it's

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
type of content that's in there if it's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.370 
type of content that's in there if it's
say<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.070> photography<00:01:07.880> show<00:01:08.120> or<00:01:08.450> an<00:01:08.600> art<00:01:08.810> show<00:01:09.080> it

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
say a photography show or an art show it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.770 
say a photography show or an art show it
would<00:01:09.470> be<00:01:09.530> very<00:01:09.770> image<00:01:10.130> heavy<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:11.390> if<00:01:11.510> it<00:01:11.630> was

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
would be very image heavy but if it was

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.630 
would be very image heavy but if it was
more<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.170> an<00:01:12.320> informational<00:01:12.650> poster<00:01:13.490> or

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
more of an informational poster or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.420 
more of an informational poster or
advertising<00:01:14.210> poster<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:15.440> may<00:01:15.620> have<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:16.190> little

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
advertising poster it may have a little

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.900 
advertising poster it may have a little
more<00:01:16.550> text<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.190> all<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.430> those<00:01:19.550> should<00:01:19.850> be

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
more text so all of those should be

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.150 
more text so all of those should be
taken<00:01:20.270> into<00:01:20.390> consideration<00:01:20.980> you<00:01:21.980> should

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
taken into consideration you should

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.190 
taken into consideration you should
always<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.550> thinking<00:01:22.580> about<00:01:23.080> hierarchy<00:01:24.080> of

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
always be thinking about hierarchy of

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800 
always be thinking about hierarchy of
images<00:01:24.710> versus<00:01:25.190> text<00:01:25.640> what's<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.570> first

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
images versus text what's the first

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.230 
images versus text what's the first
thing<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.290> want<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.860> viewer<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.340> see<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.850> it

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
thing you want the viewer to see is it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.720 
thing you want the viewer to see is it
the<00:01:29.960> name<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.590> location<00:01:30.980> where<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.520> show

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
the name of the location where the show

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.640 
the name of the location where the show
is<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.900> art<00:01:33.050> itself<00:01:33.530> or<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.090> date<00:01:35.500> there<00:01:36.500> are

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
is the art itself or the date there are

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.110 
is the art itself or the date there are
various<00:01:37.010> other<00:01:37.130> components<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:37.909> come

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
various other components that can come

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.330 
various other components that can come
into<00:01:38.270> play<00:01:38.360> but<00:01:38.900> those<00:01:39.860> are<00:01:40.040> kind<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
into play but those are kind of the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.160 
into play but those are kind of the
three<00:01:40.670> main<00:01:40.850> things<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.480> hierarchy<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.080> very

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
three main things in hierarchy is very

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.050 
three main things in hierarchy is very
important<00:01:42.860> with<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.100> poster<00:01:43.460> design<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
important with the poster design so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.250 
important with the poster design so
keeping<00:01:47.060> all<00:01:47.180> of<00:01:47.240> those<00:01:47.420> in<00:01:47.630> mind<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:48.080> sort

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
keeping all of those in mind it's sort

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.810 
keeping all of those in mind it's sort
of<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.409> balancing<00:01:48.920> act<00:01:49.100> then<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.460> have<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
of a balancing act then you have to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.980 
of a balancing act then you have to
think<00:01:50.000> about<00:01:50.710> balance<00:01:52.090> color<00:01:53.090> scheme<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.870> all

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
think about balance color scheme and all

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.560 
think about balance color scheme and all
of<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:54.710> hierarchy<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.390> main

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
of that but hierarchy is one of the main

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.950 
of that but hierarchy is one of the main
keys<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.080> poster<00:01:57.440> design<00:01:58.390> my<00:01:59.390> name<00:01:59.570> is<00:01:59.720> Karl
