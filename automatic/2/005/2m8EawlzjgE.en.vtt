00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:44.270
 but a much better variety of events 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:47.120
 first of all the accent is there agreed that 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.030
 some hope mobile what it is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.010
 besides, it was thought of favelas 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.320
 that's the case we had the draws of 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.300
 hens so now who knows of 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.810
 future opponents of the Nordics if we 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 can say that it's safe to ask who 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 except the names state but it was my 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.360
 group I think after I watched all 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.610
 the teams that's true it was my 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.820
 team then we can not say that it's okay 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.800
 to be easy but at the same time of course 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.380
 our goal is sure it'll be 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 to pass the group 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.899
 yeah bah yeah why not but after 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.020
 it passed me play a quarter-final 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.850
 it's peace are yet more especially 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.039
 at home anyway blow bah yes but 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.800
 it is necessary to believe it is sure no 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.990
 but it's true but after we'll see 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.149
 we do not know anything there now and we 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 has a share of which we have a new coach 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.860
 and one has one is not there is stuff 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.530
 who change then we'll see but 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.530
 frankly for me it's 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.750
 I really think we can do a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.330
 same time it's home what 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.630
 it's Gothenburg more then it's done 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.000
 pleasure 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.190
 of more responsibility of being 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.650
 captain bah yes and not at the same time 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.130
 first of all it's not just me and I'm going 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.000
 share this and with someone l'insee 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 badly we are two 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 after frankly in our team he 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.680
 there are a lot of leaders there are a lot 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.630
 many girls who took her 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.780
 super gt so that I'm not going 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.850
 a lot changed I 'm like I'm 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.280
 I hope that what you do on the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.519
 field it shows the example 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.459
 you have to try to stay well 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.030
 to always do yeah 100% a whole thing 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.680
 do you want that yes that's it 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.209
 thing that afterwards it's an honor 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.730
 no frankly I'm happy 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.980
 at the same time I try not to overdo it 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.600
 change to everyone all to the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.730
 girls 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.730
 m and then ignore it
