00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
now if you notice our message has ended

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.570 
now if you notice our message has ended
up<00:00:06.299> over<00:00:06.420> here<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.930> left<00:00:07.910> so<00:00:10.400> let's<00:00:11.400> move

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
up over here on the left so let's move

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.509 
up over here on the left so let's move
that<00:00:11.730> back<00:00:11.940> over<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.360> content<00:00:12.840> area<00:00:13.139> so

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
that back over to the content area so

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.150 
that back over to the content area so
instead<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.969> echoing<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.160> success

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
instead of actually echoing the success

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
instead of actually echoing the success
or<00:00:17.369> air<00:00:17.699> handling<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:20.570> we<00:00:21.570> could<00:00:21.689> do

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
or air handling right here we could do

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.790 
or air handling right here we could do
this<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> couple<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.439> ways<00:00:24.410> we<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.590> change

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
this a couple of ways we could change

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
this a couple of ways we could change
the<00:00:26.039> name<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> result<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:30.300> move<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.750> if

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the name of result and move this if

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
the name of result and move this if
statement<00:00:31.410> down<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:32.669> column<00:00:33.120> number

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
statement down here into column number

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.410 
statement down here into column number
two<00:00:34.399> because<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.550> doesn't<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.030> need

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
two because this doesn't actually need

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.360 
two because this doesn't actually need
to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.100> for

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to be are all the time but for

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.900 
to be are all the time but for
consistency<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.239> continue<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> use<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.910> but

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
consistency we continue to use our but

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.600 
consistency we continue to use our but
if<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.120> put<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:42.890> here<00:00:43.890> without<00:00:44.070> changing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
if we put it down here without changing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
if we put it down here without changing
the<00:00:44.670> name<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the name of it well our is gonna be a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
the name of it well our is gonna be a
totally<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.879> we're

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
totally different thing because we're

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
totally different thing because we're
redefining<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.710> 75<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.610> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
redefining our right here on 75 so we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.639 
redefining our right here on 75 so we
don't<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.440> can

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
don't want to do it that way but we can

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.160 
don't want to do it that way but we can
also<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.390> ahead<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.809> save<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
also do is go ahead and just save a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.750 
also do is go ahead and just save a
variable<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:01.079> let's<00:01:01.109> try<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.370> instead<00:01:02.520> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
variable so let's try that so instead of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
variable so let's try that so instead of
echo<00:01:03.409> let's<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> variable<00:01:05.129> called

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
echo let's make a variable called

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.310 
echo let's make a variable called
message<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> message<00:01:08.369> equals<00:01:08.790> page<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.659> added

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.840 

now<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.590> come<00:01:13.710> down<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.369> replace

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
now we can come down here and replace

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
now we can come down here and replace
echo<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.020> message

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 

but<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.580> two<00:01:23.759> lines<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.479> we

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
but now we have two lines and what we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
but now we have two lines and what we
could<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.590> ahead<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.100> add<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
could do is just go ahead and add this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
could do is just go ahead and add this
up<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> string<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.200> some<00:01:28.380> more

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
up here to the string do some more

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.690 
up here to the string do some more
concatenating<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.570> show<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> another

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
concatenating or I can show you another

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
concatenating or I can show you another
thing<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> PHP<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.930> which<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
thing you can do in PHP here which is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.350 
thing you can do in PHP here which is
add<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> string<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.250> let's<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.729> message

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
add to a string so now let's do message

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
add to a string so now let's do message
and<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.600> concatenate<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
and we can concatenate this way we do

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850 
and we can concatenate this way we do
dot<00:01:44.700> equals<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.830> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
dot equals and what that will do is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.510 
dot equals and what that will do is
pretty<00:01:47.820> much<00:01:48.350> take<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:49.680> added<00:01:50.039> here

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
pretty much take what we've added here

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.930 
pretty much take what we've added here
and<00:01:51.049> tack<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.080> on<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> end<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.550> now

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
and tack it on to the end of this so now

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.490 
and tack it on to the end of this so now
what<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.149> need<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.720> display<00:01:58.289> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
what we need to do is display this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.779 
what we need to do is display this
message<00:01:58.679> somewhere<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.460> let's<00:01:59.580> come<00:01:59.759> down

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
message somewhere so let's come down

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.559 
message somewhere so let's come down
here<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.840> where<00:02:00.929> we<00:02:01.110> had<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> query

gonna<00:02:28.470> get<00:02:28.650> an<00:02:28.769> error<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> warning<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> let's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
gonna get an error or a warning so let's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:41.290 
gonna get an error or a warning so let's
do<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:33.019> set<00:02:37.100> message

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.490 

then<00:02:42.300> let's<00:02:42.690> just<00:02:42.840> go<00:02:42.930> ahead<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.380> on

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
then let's just go ahead and do this on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.780 
then let's just go ahead and do this on
one<00:02:43.530> line<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.040> keep<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> clean

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
one line to keep it clean

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.600 
one line to keep it clean
echo<00:02:49.250> message<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.459> actually

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
echo message and then we can actually

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.949 
echo message and then we can actually
bump<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.240> up<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.660> one<00:02:54.810> line

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.339

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
and save that let's go ahead and test it

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.830 
and save that let's go ahead and test it
let's<00:03:08.349> go<00:03:08.530> ahead<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.769> reload<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.219> page<00:03:09.840> and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
of those more vague messages I was

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.080 
of those more vague messages I was
talking<00:04:30.110> about<00:04:30.340> says<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.550> an<00:04:31.610> error<00:04:31.819> in<00:04:31.969> my

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
talking about says I have an error in my

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.200 
talking about says I have an error in my
SQL<00:04:32.270> syntax<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.379> it<00:04:34.159> says<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.550> look<00:04:34.849> in<00:04:35.060> the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
SQL syntax and it says to look in the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.629 
SQL syntax and it says to look in the
manual<00:04:35.830> for<00:04:36.830> MySQL<00:04:38.110> for<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.430> correct<00:04:40.430> syntax

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
manual for MySQL for the correct syntax

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.230 
manual for MySQL for the correct syntax
to<00:04:41.060> use<00:04:41.240> right<00:04:41.569> around<00:04:41.870> here<00:04:42.759> which<00:04:43.759> it's

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
to use right around here which it's

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.270 
to use right around here which it's
pretty<00:04:44.509> vague<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.020> that's<00:04:45.710> why<00:04:45.830> we<00:04:45.979> echoed

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
pretty vague and that's why we echoed

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.300 
pretty vague and that's why we echoed
out<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.430> copy<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.939> query<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.080> can<00:04:48.259> kind<00:04:49.250> of

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
out a copy the query so we can kind of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.770 
out a copy the query so we can kind of
take<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> look<00:04:49.729> at<00:04:49.879> this<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.180> examine<00:04:50.599> what's

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
take a look at this and examine what's

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.740 
take a look at this and examine what's
going<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.979> here<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.460> see<00:04:55.639> our<00:04:55.849> apostrophe

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
going on and here you see our apostrophe

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.680 
going on and here you see our apostrophe
or<00:04:56.990> single<00:04:57.560> quote<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.039> you<00:04:58.789> can<00:04:58.940> see<00:04:59.150> if<00:04:59.569> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
or single quote and you can see if you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.450 
or single quote and you can see if you
look<00:04:59.719> at<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.139> pretty<00:05:00.319> close<00:05:00.620> here's<00:05:01.219> what's

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
look at it pretty close here's what's

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.570 
look at it pretty close here's what's
happening<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:03.530> single<00:05:03.949> quote<00:05:04.129> is<00:05:04.280> actually

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
happening the single quote is actually

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.089 
happening the single quote is actually
breaking<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.030> string<00:05:06.310> it<00:05:07.310> doesn't<00:05:07.639> like<00:05:07.789> that

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
breaking the string it doesn't like that

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:14.439 
breaking the string it doesn't like that
same<00:05:10.099> would<00:05:10.279> go<00:05:10.310> for<00:05:10.729> a<00:05:11.199> double<00:05:12.199> quote<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:14.330> we

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
same would go for a double quote so we

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.029 
same would go for a double quote so we
actually<00:05:14.599> need<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.960> run<00:05:15.139> a<00:05:15.199> function<00:05:15.620> to

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
actually need to run a function to

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.159 
actually need to run a function to
correct<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:16.759> so<00:05:17.479> what<00:05:17.629> we're<00:05:17.750> going<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.900> use

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
correct that so what we're going to use

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.890 
correct that so what we're going to use
is<00:05:18.379> the<00:05:18.529> MySQL<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.699> real<00:05:20.330> escape<00:05:20.870> string

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
is the MySQL I real escape string

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.450 
is the MySQL I real escape string
function<00:05:23.199> and<00:05:24.199> this<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:24.800> going<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.129> escape

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
function and this is going to escape

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.610 
function and this is going to escape
those<00:05:26.090> characters<00:05:27.310> which<00:05:28.310> escaping<00:05:29.029> is<00:05:29.620> if

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
those characters which escaping is if

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.600 
those characters which escaping is if
we're<00:05:30.770> going<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.949> do<00:05:31.039> by<00:05:31.190> hand<00:05:31.460> you<00:05:31.580> would

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
we're going to do by hand you would

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.659 
we're going to do by hand you would
place<00:05:31.849> a<00:05:32.120> backslash<00:05:32.900> before<00:05:33.889> the<00:05:34.219> characters

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
place a backslash before the characters

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.010 
place a backslash before the characters
that<00:05:34.819> you<00:05:34.879> need<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.300> tell<00:05:35.479> MySQL<00:05:36.080> take<00:05:36.349> these

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
that you need to tell MySQL take these

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.869 
that you need to tell MySQL take these
literally<00:05:39.020> don't<00:05:39.409> use<00:05:39.650> these<00:05:39.860> as<00:05:40.069> the<00:05:40.339> end<00:05:40.550> of

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:40.879 
literally don't use these as the end of

literally don't use these as the end of
my<00:05:41.089> string<00:05:43.509> so<00:05:44.509> what<00:05:44.659> we<00:05:44.750> need<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:44.990> do<00:05:45.199> is

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
my string so what we need to do is

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.260 
my string so what we need to do is
escape<00:05:46.490> pretty<00:05:47.089> much<00:05:47.270> every<00:05:47.629> one<00:05:47.779> of<00:05:47.839> these
