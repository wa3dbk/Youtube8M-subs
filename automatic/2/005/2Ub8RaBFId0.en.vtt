here's<00:00:00.690> animated<00:00:01.410> shockwave<00:00:02.040> flash<00:00:02.520> long<00:00:03.270> arm

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
here's animated shockwave flash long arm

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.380 
here's animated shockwave flash long arm
I've<00:00:04.350> gotten<00:00:04.560> requests<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.220> do<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.520> video<00:00:06.270> on

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I've gotten requests to do a video on

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.009 
I've gotten requests to do a video on
his<00:00:06.660> transform<00:00:07.350> because<00:00:08.090> you<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.300> he<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.780> kind

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
his transform because you can he is kind

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.749 
his transform because you can he is kind
of<00:00:10.110> interesting<00:00:10.370> transform<00:00:11.370> figure<00:00:11.610> which

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
of interesting transform figure which

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.990 
of interesting transform figure which
part<00:00:12.240> goes<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.750> which<00:00:12.929> mode<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.160> i'll<00:00:14.880> start

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
part goes in which mode so i'll start

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.849 
part goes in which mode so i'll start
off<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.509> his<00:00:15.900> shock<00:00:16.410> wave<00:00:16.619> mode<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.369> now

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
off with his shock wave mode here now

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
off with his shock wave mode here now
his<00:00:19.859> gun<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.270> foot<00:00:21.480> has

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
his gun when I like when my foot has

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
his gun when I like when my foot has
gone<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:23.400> these

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
gone on I like to have it what these

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.420 
gone on I like to have it what these
extended<00:00:24.359> these<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.810> things<00:00:24.840> here<00:00:25.430> just

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
extended these little things here just

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.310 
extended these little things here just
kind<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.730> outside<00:00:27.119> guns<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:28.140> up

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
kind of like outside guns but that's up

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
kind of like outside guns but that's up
to<00:00:28.640> preference<00:00:30.019> and<00:00:31.489> there's<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.850> that

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
to preference and there's one thing that

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
to preference and there's one thing that
I<00:00:33.450> didn't<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.079> quite<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.649> time<00:00:34.680> my

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
I didn't know for quite some time my

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.700 
I didn't know for quite some time my
friend<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:35.579> showed<00:00:36.360> me<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.110> his<00:00:37.320> waist

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
friend actually showed me that his waist

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.459 
friend actually showed me that his waist
here<00:00:38.360> only<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.450> he<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.719> shock<00:00:39.899> wave<00:00:40.140> mode

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
here only when he was in shock wave mode

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.299 
here only when he was in shock wave mode
it<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.640> been<00:00:42.540> got<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.710> extra<00:00:44.040> snap

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it actually been got a little extra snap

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.630 
it actually been got a little extra snap
in<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.730> didn't<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.010> I've<00:00:47.010> had<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> figure

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
in there didn't it I've had this figure

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.279 
in there didn't it I've had this figure
4<00:00:47.820> months<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.210> didn't<00:00:48.539> realize<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.899> he's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
4 months and I didn't realize that he's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
4 months and I didn't realize that he's
like<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.280> could<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.640> now<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
like I really could do that now it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.080 
like I really could do that now it
doesn't<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.350> add<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.770> whole<00:00:52.949> bunch<00:00:53.670> kind

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
doesn't really add to a whole bunch kind

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
doesn't really add to a whole bunch kind
of<00:00:54.149> give<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> hunched<00:00:54.660> pose<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.440> hey

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of give them a hunched pose but hey

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.229 
of give them a hunched pose but hey
which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> own<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.940> find<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> good

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
which is own if you can find a good

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
which is own if you can find a good
creative<00:00:57.690> pose<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.230> him<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.859> more

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
creative pose for him with it then more

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.299 
creative pose for him with it then more
power<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> let<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.980> anyway<00:01:01.980> so

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
power to you let me know anyway so

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
power to you let me know anyway so
here's<00:01:02.550> shock<00:01:02.699> wave<00:01:02.910> mode<00:01:03.210> notice<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> red

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
down here that's the long arm up here is

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.679 
down here that's the long arm up here is
for<00:01:21.270> shock<00:01:21.450> wave<00:01:21.799> he<00:01:22.799> hands<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.509> hand

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
for shock wave he hands the little hand

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
for shock wave he hands the little hand
is<00:01:24.780> thumb<00:01:25.259> these<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> fingers<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.640> go

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
is thumb these are the fingers that go

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.530 
is thumb these are the fingers that go
on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> outside<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.770> arms<00:01:29.220> extend<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
on the outside these can arms extend so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
on the outside these can arms extend so
the<00:01:30.570> extended<00:01:31.259> fully<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> way<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.340> for

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the extended fully all the way is for

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.560 
the extended fully all the way is for
shock<00:01:33.060> waves<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> waist<00:01:35.310> part<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:36.119> purple

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
shock waves the waist part these purple

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
shock waves the waist part these purple
sections<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.320> slide<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
sections they slide up and down and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
sections they slide up and down and
there<00:01:38.700> they<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.150> extended<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.439> shock<00:01:40.740> wave

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
there they are extended for shock wave

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.560 
there they are extended for shock wave
mode<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.460> well<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> tank<00:01:42.090> treads<00:01:42.390> are

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
mode as well as the tank treads are

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
mode as well as the tank treads are
pushed<00:01:42.869> they<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> tank

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
pushed they can get it so the tank

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.490 
pushed they can get it so the tank
treads<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> way<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
treads go all the way up there and the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.010 
treads go all the way up there and the
part<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> shins<00:01:47.399> face<00:01:47.790> forward<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
part of the shins face forward at the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
part of the shins face forward at the
shock<00:01:49.229> wave<00:01:49.470> mode<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:50.909> we'll<00:01:51.149> take

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
shock wave mode so right now we'll take

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.139 
shock wave mode so right now we'll take
them<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.630> long<00:01:51.990> arm<00:01:52.439> mode<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
them into long arm mode will do that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.749 
them into long arm mode will do that
will<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.630> arm<00:01:54.840> stuff<00:01:55.170> first<00:01:55.579> put<00:01:56.579> these

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
will do the arm stuff first put these

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.830 
will do the arm stuff first put these
around<00:01:57.619> like<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.130> pivot<00:01:59.659> take<00:02:00.659> his

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
around like that is pivot take his

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.060 
around like that is pivot take his
shoulders<00:02:01.280> bring<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.490> down

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
shoulders bring them down

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
shoulders bring them down
arms<00:02:05.070> aren't<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> actually<00:02:06.210> shove

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
arms aren't going to actually shove

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
arms aren't going to actually shove
right<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.470> into<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.310> arm<00:02:08.580> shoulder<00:02:09.179> I

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
right up into it for arm shoulder I

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.090 
right up into it for arm shoulder I
guess<00:02:10.009> fingers<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.340> push<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.100> they've

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
guess fingers will push back and they've

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.370 
guess fingers will push back and they've
got<00:02:14.220> joint<00:02:15.030> therefore<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.480> calvo<00:02:15.840> his<00:02:16.170> arm

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
got joint therefore this calvo his arm

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.300 
got joint therefore this calvo his arm
is<00:02:16.500> shorter<00:02:17.690> yeah<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.080> fingers<00:02:20.010> go<00:02:20.190> over

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
is shorter yeah and fingers go over

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.170 
is shorter yeah and fingers go over
there<00:02:21.200> that's<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.890> up<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.310> if<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.060> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
there that's like to go up and if it is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.699 
there that's like to go up and if it is
right<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.380> you're<00:02:25.530> done

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
right there then you know you're done

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.490 
right there then you know you're done
with<00:02:25.860> long<00:02:26.040> arms<00:02:26.190> arms<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.959> course<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.319> gotta

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
with long arms arms of course we gotta

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400 
with long arms arms of course we gotta
flip<00:02:28.739> around<00:02:28.860> tues<00:02:29.870> Autobot<00:02:30.870> symbol<00:02:31.050> there

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
flip around tues Autobot symbol there

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.010 
flip around tues Autobot symbol there
now<00:02:32.250> here<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.360> his<00:02:33.420> head<00:02:33.630> there's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
now here on the back of his head there's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.720 
now here on the back of his head there's
the<00:02:34.230> little<00:02:34.380> thingy<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.250> kind<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.489> pushes

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the little thingy that kind of pushes

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.120 
the little thingy that kind of pushes
down<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.569> when<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.750> push<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.110> base<00:02:38.100> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
down see that when you push it base a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.360 
down see that when you push it base a
flop<00:02:38.489> down<00:02:38.840> far<00:02:39.840> along<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.260> mode<00:02:40.530> well<00:02:41.220> if

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
flop down far along are mode well if

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.020 
flop down far along are mode well if
that<00:02:41.519> goes<00:02:41.670> down<00:02:41.940> there<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:43.760> whole<00:02:44.760> hip

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that goes down there the whole hip

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.300 
that goes down there the whole hip
section<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.380> push<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.310> these

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
section going to push up and these

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.380 
section going to push up and these
actually<00:02:53.610> clip<00:02:54.709> up<00:02:55.709> into<00:02:56.160> his<00:02:57.200> torso<00:02:59.180> now<00:03:00.180> his

like using it as a shield and when
you're<00:03:34.560> doing<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.890> shield<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.549> either

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
you're doing is a shield you can either

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.840 
you're doing is a shield you can either
have<00:03:35.880> these<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.299> or<00:03:36.810> down<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:38.489> them<00:03:38.640> down

have these up or down I like them down
sometimes<00:03:39.269> I'll<00:03:39.540> flip<00:03:39.690> them<00:03:39.810> up<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.650> be

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
sometimes I'll flip them up just to be

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.910 
sometimes I'll flip them up just to be
part<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> transform<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.739> there<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
part of the transform but there is a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.199 
part of the transform but there is a
sophist<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.760> shield<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.950> there<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.370> long<00:03:47.970> arm

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
sophist is shield so there is long arm

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.110 
sophist is shield so there is long arm
and<00:03:48.450> then<00:03:49.049> when<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.560> into<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:50.010> crane<00:03:50.400> mode

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and then when you go into is crane mode

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.650 
and then when you go into is crane mode
will<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.660> queen<00:03:51.870> note<00:03:52.079> first<00:03:52.290> from<00:03:52.620> longer

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
will be queen note first from longer

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.120 
will be queen note first from longer
we're<00:03:54.660> going<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.989> push<00:03:55.410> his<00:03:55.530> head<00:03:55.650> all<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.920> way

is<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.560> tricky<00:05:09.830> part<00:05:10.430> for<00:05:10.670> some<00:05:10.970> people<00:05:11.300> is<00:05:11.660> that

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
is a tricky part for some people is that

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.070 
is a tricky part for some people is that
these<00:05:12.860> kind<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.340> bend<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.270> quits<00:05:14.510> down<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:14.990> a

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
these kind of bend it quits down in a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.050 
these kind of bend it quits down in a
place<00:05:15.290> like<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.190> do<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.460> first<00:05:16.730> and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
place like that so you do that first and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.000 
place like that so you do that first and
which<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:17.690> there<00:05:17.900> then<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.260> can<00:05:18.410> slide<00:05:18.710> the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
which is there then you can slide the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.320 
which is there then you can slide the
one<00:05:19.460> piece<00:05:19.700> into<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.120> other<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.970> serves<00:05:22.970> legs

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
one piece into the other and serves legs

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.470 
one piece into the other and serves legs
go<00:05:23.660> down<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:24.170> internet<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:26.210> can<00:05:26.240> leave

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
go down that internet and you can leave

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.300 
go down that internet and you can leave
the<00:05:26.630> top<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.350> him<00:05:27.440> that<00:05:27.590> way<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.890> kind<00:05:28.070> of<00:05:28.160> don't

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
the top of him that way I kind of don't

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.770 
the top of him that way I kind of don't
like<00:05:28.430> those<00:05:28.640> gaps<00:05:28.880> there<00:05:29.120> so<00:05:29.390> I<00:05:29.600> actually

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
like those gaps there so I actually

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.730 
like those gaps there so I actually
extend<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.560> fingers<00:05:31.960> over<00:05:32.960> like<00:05:33.230> that<00:05:33.410> kind

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
extend the fingers over like that kind

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.680 
extend the fingers over like that kind
of<00:05:33.800> give<00:05:33.920> the<00:05:33.950> smoother<00:05:34.400> look<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:35.030> we're

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
of give the smoother look and we're

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.590 
of give the smoother look and we're
going<00:05:35.870> into<00:05:35.990> crane<00:05:36.290> mode<00:05:36.500> so<00:05:37.450> you're<00:05:38.450> just

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
going into crane mode so you're just

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.400 
going into crane mode so you're just
kind<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:38.870> strict<00:05:39.170> bending<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:41.169> single<00:05:42.169> pieces

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
kind of strict bending the single pieces

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.310 
kind of strict bending the single pieces
to<00:05:42.830> there

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
to there

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.550 
to there
and<00:05:44.410> crane<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.960> kind<00:05:47.140> of<00:05:47.170> like<00:05:47.320> putting

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
and crane and I kind of like putting

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.280 
and crane and I kind of like putting
those<00:05:47.740> up<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.190> make<00:05:48.370> little<00:05:48.580> like<00:05:49.210> control<00:05:49.690> of

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
those up and make little like control of

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.470 
those up and make little like control of
the<00:05:50.410> hook<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:54.190> part<00:05:54.460> goes<00:05:54.730> right<00:05:55.270> there

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
the hook and that part goes right there

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.440 
the hook and that part goes right there
and<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:56.830> side<00:05:57.070> over<00:05:57.190> here<00:05:57.640> it's<00:05:57.940> got<00:05:58.120> more<00:05:58.420> of

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
and this side over here it's got more of

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.890 
and this side over here it's got more of
a<00:05:58.690> docking<00:05:59.470> bay<00:05:59.650> type<00:05:59.980> of<00:06:00.190> area<00:06:00.640> or<00:06:01.420> your<00:06:01.720> hook

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
a docking bay type of area or your hook

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.990 
a docking bay type of area or your hook
to<00:06:02.140> move<00:06:02.320> new<00:06:02.770> ver<00:06:02.890> in<00:06:03.070> as<00:06:03.340> opposed<00:06:03.670> to<00:06:03.880> this

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
to move new ver in as opposed to this

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.240 
to move new ver in as opposed to this
side<00:06:04.270> you<00:06:05.020> can<00:06:05.260> work<00:06:05.380> on<00:06:05.470> that<00:06:05.620> way<00:06:05.740> too<00:06:05.800> but<00:06:06.100> I

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
side you can work on that way too but I

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.830 
side you can work on that way too but I
like<00:06:06.520> putting<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:06.970> way<00:06:07.180> especially

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
like putting it this way especially

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.810 
like putting it this way especially
because<00:06:08.350> the<00:06:08.710> cannon<00:06:09.310> looks<00:06:09.460> better<00:06:09.670> the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
because the cannon looks better the

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.420 
because the cannon looks better the
other<00:06:09.880> direction<00:06:10.090> so<00:06:10.480> this<00:06:10.570> wave<00:06:10.750> lips<00:06:11.020> around

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
other direction so this wave lips around

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.900 
other direction so this wave lips around
rope<00:06:12.430> mode<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.720> then<00:06:14.590> going<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:15.070> shock<00:06:15.670> wave

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
rope mode and then going to shock wave

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.530 
rope mode and then going to shock wave
tank<00:06:16.690> mode<00:06:17.970> new<00:06:18.970> strings<00:06:20.010> back<00:06:21.010> front<00:06:21.550> out<00:06:21.820> and

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
tank mode new strings back front out and

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.650 
tank mode new strings back front out and
one<00:06:22.930> going<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.880> put<00:06:24.880> this<00:06:25.000> hook<00:06:25.210> games<00:06:25.420> of

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
one going to put this hook games of

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.930 
one going to put this hook games of
barrels<00:06:26.140> extended<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.490> can<00:06:27.640> have<00:06:27.790> these

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
barrels extended and you can have these

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.300 
barrels extended and you can have these
out<00:06:28.210> as<00:06:28.540> like<00:06:28.900> when<00:06:29.140> lasers<00:06:29.500> or<00:06:29.950> you<00:06:30.040> can<00:06:30.160> put

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
out as like when lasers or you can put
