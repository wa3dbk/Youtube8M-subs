00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.150
 We know that it has already happened to Aaron 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.619
 He told them to put aside the gold earrings 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.929
 that are in the ears of yours 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 they had in their ears and they brought them 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.620
 to aaron and he took from the hands of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.440
 them and shaped it with burin and made 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.559
 it a casting calf then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.989
 they said israel these are your gods that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149
 they took you out of the land of Egypt and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.910
 seeing this aaron built an altar 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.390
 in front of hills and trumpeted aaron and said 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.309
 tomorrow will be a holiday for jehovah and day 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 next they got up early and offered gold 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.679
 cautious and presented offerings of peace and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.920
 the people sat down to eat and drink and 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.860
 he rose to rejoice then jehovah 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 he said to moisÃ©s anda descends because you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 town that you took 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670
 Egypt has been corrupted soon they have 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 aside from the way which I commanded them be 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.900
 have made a casting calf and what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 they have worshiped and offered 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 sacrifices and they have said israel these are 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.480
 your gods that took you from the earth 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.890
 from egypt said more jehovah to moses 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.350
 magazine this town that by the way is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.840
 village of dura services now 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.360
 let me turn my anger on them and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.690
 I will consume them and from you I will make a nation 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.180
 big then Moses prayed in presence 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.640
 of jehovah his god and said oh jehovah 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.710
 for your fury will be kindled against you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.950
 village that you brought from the land of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.150
 Egypt with great power and strong hand 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.940
 because the Egyptians have to speak 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.160
 saying bad brought them out to kill them 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.040
 in the mountains and to attract them from 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.259
 the face of the earth turn from the burning 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.440
 of your wrath and repent of this evil 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.810
 against your people remember abraham's 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 Isaac and Israel 'your servants to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
 which is sworn by yourself and you have 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.540
 said I will multiply yours 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.300
 offspring as the stars of the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.569
 heaven and I will give your descendants all 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.790
 is 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.609
 land of which I have spoken and will take it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.859
 for real forever then 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.439
 Jehovah repented of the evil that he said 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.749
 what he had to do to his people and he returned 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.489
 Moses and descended from the mountain bringing in 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.519
 his hand the two tables of the testimony 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.459
 the tables written by both sides of 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.859
 both sides were written and the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.870
 tables were God's work and writing 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.659
 it was God's script will record over the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.780
 tables when I jumped the clamor of 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.939
 shouting people said shouting Moses 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.310
 of fight and in the camp and he 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:52.200
 he answered is not the voice of howls of 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.769
 strong nor voice of howls of weak 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.840
 pitcher's voice and I go and it happened that 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.359
 when he arrived at the camp and saw the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.669
 calf and the dances burned the wrath of 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.790
 Moses and threw the boards of his hands 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.949
 and broke them at the foot of the mountain and took the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.840
 calf they had made and burned it in 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.569
 the fire and moved it to reduce it to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.910
 dust that he scattered over the waters and what 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.850
 he gave drink to the children of israel 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.710
 and said Aaron Moses who has done this to you 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.310
 town that you have brought over the great 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.530
 sin and responded to aaron do not get angry 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.200
 my lord you know the town that is 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.240
 inclined to evil because they told me to do 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.430
 the gods that go before us 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.830
 because to this bassinet the man who 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.920
 pulled from the land of egypt we do not know 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.790
 what happened to him and I answered 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.100
 who has gold set it aside and they gave it to me 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.950
 and I threw it into the fire and it came out 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.960
 calf and watching bassinet that the town 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.270
 I was rampant because they aaron what 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.610
 had allowed to shame between their 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.180
 enemies got moses at the door of the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.190
 camp and said who is for jehovah 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.620
 join me and join him 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.220
 all the sons of levy and he told them 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.690
 This is how the god of Israel has said jehovah 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.060
 put each one of his sword on his 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.940
 thigh passed and back door to door 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.640
 through the camp and kill everyone his 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.290
 brother and his friend and his relative and 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.930
 the children of the ebb and they did it according to 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.370
 to the saying of moses and fell from the village 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.040
 in that day like three thousand men 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.470
 then Moses said today you have 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.389
 consecrated to jehovah, each one has 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.580
 consecrated in his son and his brother 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.070
 so that the blessing today on 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.860
 you and it happened that day 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.320
 next said Moses to the people you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.990
 you have committed a great sin but I 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.260
 I will go up now to jehovah maybe I will apply 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.290
 about your sin then he came back 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.960
 moses to jehovah and said I beg you then 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.970
 this town has committed a great sin 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.910
 because they became golden gods that 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.580
 forgive your sin now and if it does not reign 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.130
 now of your book that you have written in 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.850
 jehovah replied to Moses who to sin 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.650
 against me to this ray of my book 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.110
 later now it takes to this town to 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.720
 where have I told you here my angel will go 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.289
 in front of you but on the day of punishment 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.240
 I will punish them for their sin and jehovah 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.650
 wounded the people because they had done the 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.650
 calf which Aaron
