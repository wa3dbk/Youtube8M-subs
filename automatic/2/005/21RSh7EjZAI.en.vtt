can<00:00:41.610> lower<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.660> screen<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can lower this screen so it kind of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
can lower this screen so it kind of
darkens<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> shot<00:00:45.079> but<00:00:46.079> check<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:47.510> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
