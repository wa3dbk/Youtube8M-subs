about<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.280> physicists<00:00:35.700> say<00:00:35.940> glass

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
about this is when physicists say glass

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
about this is when physicists say glass
they<00:00:36.450> don't<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.780> mean<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> glass<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
they don't just mean the glass that you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.110 
they don't just mean the glass that you
have<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.129> windows<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.640> mean<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:38.910> kinds

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
have in your windows we mean all kinds

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
have in your windows we mean all kinds
of<00:00:39.329> different<00:00:39.450> materials<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.739> these

of different materials that have these

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.350 
of different materials that have these
funny<00:00:41.129> prophecies<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> being<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
funny prophecies of being a bit like a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
funny prophecies of being a bit like a
liquid<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> solid<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
liquid and a bit like a solid and one

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.590 
liquid and a bit like a solid and one
way<00:00:45.059> there's<00:00:45.600> quite<00:00:45.780> easy<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> visualize<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
way there's quite easy to visualize a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.650 
way there's quite easy to visualize a
glass<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.660> analogy

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
glass is if you think about the analogy

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.229 
glass is if you think about the analogy
of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> atoms<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.520> glass<00:00:53.760> or<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of the atoms in in the glass or the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
of the atoms in in the glass or the
material<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.140> general<00:00:55.590> being<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
material in general being a bit like a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.260 
material in general being a bit like a
car<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.219> what<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> solid<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
car so what we can think of a solid or a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
car so what we can think of a solid or a
crystal<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> particular<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
crystal in particular we can think of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
crystal in particular we can think of
that<00:01:01.980> being<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> multi-storey<00:01:03.000> car<00:01:03.090> park

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that being like a multi-storey car park

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.450 
that being like a multi-storey car park
that's<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:03.750> full<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.080> cars<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that's all full up with cars I so one of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.250 
that's all full up with cars I so one of
the<00:01:05.580> features<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> cars<00:01:06.960> or

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the features of that is all the cars or

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.520 
the features of that is all the cars or
all<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> atoms<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.330> crystal<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.990> very

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
all the atoms in the crystal are very

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.750 
all the atoms in the crystal are very
neatly<00:01:10.740> arranged<00:01:11.310> they're<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.549> got<00:01:11.670> their

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
neatly arranged they're all got their

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
neatly arranged they're all got their
place<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> cars<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.930> got

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
place so that all the cars have got

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480 
place so that all the cars have got
their<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.229> bay<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> very

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
their little bay and they're in a very

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310 
their little bay and they're in a very
nice<00:01:14.700> ordered<00:01:15.180> state<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.170> very

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
nice ordered state and it's very

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.630 
nice ordered state and it's very
difficult<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.710> move<00:01:16.920> some<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> cars

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
difficult to move some of the cars

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.929 
difficult to move some of the cars
around<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> bump<00:01:19.380> into<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.710> cars

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
around so going to bump into other cars

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.039 
around so going to bump into other cars
so<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> liquid<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:21.930> about

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so in a liquid what we could think about

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.070 
so in a liquid what we could think about
about<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:23.330> if<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
about that is if you're at in the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
about that is if you're at in the
countryside<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> nice<00:01:25.950> open<00:01:26.130> road<00:01:26.520> and

countryside and a nice open road and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
countryside and a nice open road and
there's<00:01:27.330> very<00:01:27.509> few<00:01:27.570> other<00:01:27.810> cars<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.200> and

there's very few other cars around and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
there's very few other cars around and
if<00:01:28.619> you've<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.799> plenty<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.159> space<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> move

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
if you've got plenty of space to move

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.890 
if you've got plenty of space to move
around<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> cars<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.780> no

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and sometimes you won't you won't see a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969 
and sometimes you won't you won't see a
car<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.030> long<00:01:39.180> time<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:40.380> glass<00:01:40.560> is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
car for a very long time and a glass is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.330 
car for a very long time and a glass is
much<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> traffic<00:01:42.090> jam<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
much more like a traffic jam so in a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
much more like a traffic jam so in a
traffic<00:01:44.520> jam<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
traffic jam we have all the all of the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.740 
traffic jam we have all the all of the
cars<00:01:46.590> are<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.920> close<00:01:47.100> together<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.570> there's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cars are very close together but there's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.969 
cars are very close together but there's
no<00:01:48.869> particular<00:01:49.020> order<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.649> them<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.890> they're

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
no particular order to them so they're

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.950 
no particular order to them so they're
not<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> nice<00:01:50.399> ordered<00:01:50.820> array<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> had

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
not in a nice ordered array like we had

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.899 
not in a nice ordered array like we had
in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.380> car<00:01:52.560> pocket<00:01:53.009> which<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> crystal

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
in the car pocket which is the crystal

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
in the car pocket which is the crystal
and<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.210> other<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> strange

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and the other thing one of the strange

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.840 
and the other thing one of the strange
things<00:01:58.500> you'll<00:01:58.860> notice<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> traffic<00:01:59.820> jam

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
things you'll notice in the traffic jam

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.490 
things you'll notice in the traffic jam
is<00:02:00.119> sometimes<00:02:00.540> actually<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.990> move<00:02:01.200> quite

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
is sometimes actually you move quite

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
is sometimes actually you move quite
quickly<00:02:01.530> although<00:02:02.070> overall<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.790> very

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
quickly although overall you go very

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
quickly although overall you go very
slowly<00:02:03.180> there's<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.659> tiny<00:02:04.140> periods<00:02:04.619> where

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
slowly there's little tiny periods where

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.800 
slowly there's little tiny periods where
you<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.100> quickly<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> stop<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.479> if

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
you go quickly and then you stop and if

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.119 
you go quickly and then you stop and if
you<00:02:06.869> were<00:02:06.990> looking<00:02:07.079> from<00:02:07.649> high<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.069> a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you were looking from high up in a

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.199 
you were looking from high up in a
helicopter<00:02:08.220> or<00:02:08.610> something<00:02:08.729> you've<00:02:09.000> quite

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
helicopter or something you've quite

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.150 
helicopter or something you've quite
often<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.720> these<00:02:09.899> bits<00:02:10.110> where<00:02:10.709> cars<00:02:10.979> were

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
often see these bits where cars were

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.430 
often see these bits where cars were
moving<00:02:11.520> very<00:02:11.730> quickly<00:02:11.849> even<00:02:12.750> though<00:02:12.840> most

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
moving very quickly even though most

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.660 
moving very quickly even though most
cards<00:02:13.710> were<00:02:13.770> not<00:02:13.920> moving<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.460> very

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
cards were not moving and that's very

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.300 
cards were not moving and that's very
much<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.210> happens<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.200> glass<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
much like what happens in a glass so the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.860 
much like what happens in a glass so the
atoms<00:02:17.610> aren't<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.150> an<00:02:18.240> order<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> ray<00:02:18.690> like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
atoms aren't in an order to ray like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
atoms aren't in an order to ray like
they<00:02:18.960> would<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.350> crystal<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.760> they're

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
they would be in a crystal and they're

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.430 
they would be in a crystal and they're
all<00:02:20.970> higgledy-piggledy<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.290> see

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
all higgledy-piggledy like you would see

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440 
all higgledy-piggledy like you would see
in<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.770> liquid<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:23.670> can't<00:02:23.880> get<00:02:24.030> past<00:02:24.240> each

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
in a liquid but they can't get past each

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.730 
in a liquid but they can't get past each
other<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:24.870> they're<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.260> kind<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
other because they're in this kind of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.870 
other because they're in this kind of
jam<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:29.220> occasionally<00:02:29.640> some<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
jam and and but occasionally some of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.430 
jam and and but occasionally some of
them<00:02:30.000> seems<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.240> move<00:02:30.420> very<00:02:30.600> fast<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.290> that's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
them seems to move very fast and that's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.840 
them seems to move very fast and that's
one<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> very<00:02:32.070> strange<00:02:32.310> things<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> we

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
one of the very strange things that we

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.600 
one of the very strange things that we
really<00:02:33.090> don't<00:02:33.180> understand<00:02:33.690> about<00:02:34.520> glasses<00:02:35.520> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
really don't understand about glasses is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.100 
really don't understand about glasses is
why<00:02:35.730> sometimes<00:02:36.000> things<00:02:36.450> move<00:02:36.660> very<00:02:36.840> quickly

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
why sometimes things move very quickly

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.180 
why sometimes things move very quickly
right<00:02:37.920> there's<00:02:38.580> like<00:02:38.670> chaos<00:02:39.140> well<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.500> it's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
right there's like chaos well it's it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.140 
right there's like chaos well it's it's
a<00:02:41.400> very<00:02:41.430> disordered<00:02:42.090> state<00:02:42.330> say<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.080> chaos<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
a very disordered state say so chaos is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.000 
a very disordered state say so chaos is
not<00:02:45.150> has<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.360> technical<00:02:45.600> meaning<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.560> science

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
not has a technical meaning in science

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.720 
not has a technical meaning in science
yes<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.990> nothing<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.560> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
yes it's this is nothing to do with that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.100 
yes it's this is nothing to do with that
well<00:02:50.730> there's<00:02:51.000> always<00:02:51.090> been<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.780> theory

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
well there's always been a theory

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.730 
well there's always been a theory
because<00:02:52.500> stains<00:02:53.010> pains<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.030> stained<00:02:54.240> glass<00:02:54.270> in

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
because stains pains of stained glass in

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340 
because stains pains of stained glass in
old<00:02:55.740> churches<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.700> European<00:02:57.120> churches<00:02:57.360> have

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
old churches and European churches have

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.620 
old churches and European churches have
found<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.830> have<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.610> top<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.210> glass<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
found to have the top of the glass is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.150 
found to have the top of the glass is
thinner<00:03:00.870> than<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> bottom<00:03:01.590> which

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
thinner than it is at the bottom which

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.280 
thinner than it is at the bottom which
is<00:03:02.190> why<00:03:02.400> people<00:03:02.760> thought<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.480> glass<00:03:03.960> is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
is why people thought that the glass is

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.280 
is why people thought that the glass is
a<00:03:05.010> liquid<00:03:05.310> has<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.330> now<00:03:06.480> been<00:03:06.690> disproven

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
a liquid has that now been disproven

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
a liquid has that now been disproven
well<00:03:07.890> there's<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.280> kind<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.610> controversy<00:03:09.270> about

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
well there's a kind of controversy about

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.060 
well there's a kind of controversy about
this<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.780> I'm<00:03:09.840> certainly<00:03:10.140> not<00:03:10.290> an<00:03:10.440> expert<00:03:10.560> in

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
this and I'm certainly not an expert in

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.840 
this and I'm certainly not an expert in
the<00:03:11.340> medieval<00:03:11.820> glassmaking<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.460> but<00:03:14.460> my

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the medieval glassmaking so but my

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.130 
the medieval glassmaking so but my
understanding<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.480> that's<00:03:15.750> not<00:03:15.990> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
understanding is that that's not the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.050 
understanding is that that's not the
reason<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.280> stained<00:03:17.489> glass<00:03:17.520> windows

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
reason for the stained glass windows

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
reason for the stained glass windows
having<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.840> kind<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.170> shape<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.530> there's

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
having that kind of shape and there's

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.800 
having that kind of shape and there's
actually<00:03:19.770> more<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.420> techniques

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
actually more to do with the techniques

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.660 
actually more to do with the techniques
that<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.080> use<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.470> make<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.800> glass<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
that we use to make the glass in the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.020 
that we use to make the glass in the
Middle<00:03:23.880> Ages<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:25.739> there<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> grain<00:03:27.000> of

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
Middle Ages but there is a grain of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.550 
Middle Ages but there is a grain of
truth<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.600> story<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.170> that's<00:03:28.230> probably

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
truth in that story and that's probably

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.110 
truth in that story and that's probably
why<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.739> keeps<00:03:29.010> doing<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.580> rounds<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
why it keeps doing the rounds and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.820 
why it keeps doing the rounds and
glasses<00:03:30.690> deflates<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
glasses deflates it's just like in the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.500 
glasses deflates it's just like in the
traffic<00:03:32.160> jam<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.790> move<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.330> little

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
traffic jam where you to move a little

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300 
traffic jam where you to move a little
bit<00:03:33.660> glass<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.320> defective<00:03:34.980> light<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
bit glass is defective light and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.280 
bit glass is defective light and
actually<00:03:35.580> at<00:03:35.670> eq<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> oldest

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
actually at eq we have the oldest

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.840 
actually at eq we have the oldest

mention<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:51.410> Columbia<00:03:52.410> yes<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.060> this

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
mention of Columbia yes so this is this

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530 
mention of Columbia yes so this is this
particular<00:03:55.200> issue<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.920> what<00:03:56.610> what's<00:03:57.120> going<00:03:57.420> on

particular issue of what what's going on

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.810 
particular issue of what what's going on
with<00:03:57.780> glass<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.440> involving<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.580> best

a<00:04:01.800> step<00:04:01.980> behind<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.459> Q<00:04:02.700> well<00:04:03.480> Yuki<00:04:03.989> was

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
a step behind you Q well Yuki was

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.540 
a step behind you Q well Yuki was
certainly<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.860> step<00:04:05.040> ahead<00:04:05.160> because<00:04:05.370> this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
certainly a step ahead because this

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.160 
certainly a step ahead because this

physics at UQ guy called Thomas Parnell

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.870 
physics at UQ guy called Thomas Parnell
and<00:04:12.390> what<00:04:12.870> he<00:04:12.959> did<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.170> he<00:04:13.320> took<00:04:13.500> pitch<00:04:14.489> which

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
and what he did is he took pitch which

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.670 
and what he did is he took pitch which
is<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.060> type<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.300> tar<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.840> was<00:04:15.959> certainly<00:04:16.500> in

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
is a type of tar that was certainly in

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.460 
is a type of tar that was certainly in
those<00:04:16.799> days<00:04:16.980> commonly<00:04:17.730> used<00:04:17.940> for<00:04:18.209> things<00:04:18.390> like

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
those days commonly used for things like

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.349 
those days commonly used for things like
waterproofing<00:04:19.470> boats<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.850> what<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> do<00:04:21.239> to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
waterproofing boats and what you do to

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.120 
waterproofing boats and what you do to
waterproof<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.900> aces<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.289> heat<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.470> up<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:23.039> it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
waterproof of aces you heat it up but it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.460 
waterproof of aces you heat it up but it
becomes<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.580> bit<00:04:23.700> because<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.390> has<00:04:24.660> them<00:04:25.020> so

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
becomes a bit because it has them so

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.930 
becomes a bit because it has them so
then<00:04:25.860> has<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.160> consistency

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
then has the consistency

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.280 
then has the consistency
paint<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:27.900> can<00:04:27.960> paint<00:04:28.170> something

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
paint and so you can paint something

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.170 
paint and so you can paint something
outside<00:04:28.770> your<00:04:28.980> boats<00:04:29.190> we're<00:04:29.430> but<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.030> he

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
outside your boats we're but so he

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.570 
outside your boats we're but so he
heated<00:04:30.840> up<00:04:31.080> his<00:04:31.200> star<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.950> he<00:04:32.130> was<00:04:32.280> able<00:04:32.370> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
heated up his star and he was able to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.970 
heated up his star and he was able to
pour<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:32.940> into<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.270> into<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.570> glass<00:04:33.750> funnel<00:04:34.080> and

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
pour it into it into a glass funnel and

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.750 
pour it into it into a glass funnel and
this<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:36.480> pitch<00:04:36.750> or<00:04:37.020> tar<00:04:37.230> it<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.040> an

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
this this this pitch or tar it is an

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.340 
this this this pitch or tar it is an
example<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:39.180> one<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.360> these<00:04:39.480> materials<00:04:39.690> that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
example of one of these materials that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.140 
example of one of these materials that
the<00:04:40.590> business<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.100> called<00:04:41.310> glasses<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.000> in

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
the business is called glasses and in

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.210 
the business is called glasses and in
this<00:04:42.270> general<00:04:42.870> use<00:04:43.140> of<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> word<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:44.070> if<00:04:44.160> you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
this general use of the word so if you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.890 
this general use of the word so if you
were<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.340> hit<00:04:44.550> pitch<00:04:44.790> with<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> hammer<00:04:45.330> when<00:04:45.780> it

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
were to hit pitch with a hammer when it

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.360 
were to hit pitch with a hammer when it
was<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.170> room<00:04:46.320> temperature<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.920> would<00:04:47.190> shatter

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
was at room temperature it would shatter

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.030 
was at room temperature it would shatter
just<00:04:47.700> like<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.880> glass<00:04:48.180> with<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.770> but<00:04:49.770> picture

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
just like a glass with it but picture

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.260 
just like a glass with it but picture
also<00:04:50.160> flows<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:52.260> this<00:04:52.440> is<00:04:52.560> what<00:04:53.270> parnells

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
also flows and this is what parnells

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.850 
also flows and this is what parnells
experiment<00:04:54.840> wanted<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.170> show<00:04:55.350> say<00:04:55.620> what<00:04:55.800> he

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
experiment wanted to show say what he

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.010 
experiment wanted to show say what he
did<00:04:55.980> is<00:04:56.100> he<00:04:56.130> left<00:04:56.340> his<00:04:56.490> pitch<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.000> his<00:04:57.090> funnel

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
did is he left his pitch and his funnel

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.640 
did is he left his pitch and his funnel
for<00:04:58.560> 43<00:04:59.250> years<00:04:59.540> and<00:05:00.540> basically<00:05:01.200> just<00:05:01.380> let<00:05:01.530> it

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
for 43 years and basically just let it

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.620 
for 43 years and basically just let it
settle<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.160> didn't<00:05:02.430> do<00:05:02.520> anything<00:05:02.700> else<00:05:02.970> and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
settle and didn't do anything else and

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.390 
settle and didn't do anything else and
then<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:04.020> nineteen<00:05:04.230> thirty<00:05:04.440> he<00:05:04.950> cut<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.250> end

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
then in nineteen thirty he cut the end

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.670 
then in nineteen thirty he cut the end
off<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.630> pitch<00:05:06.780> has<00:05:06.990> been<00:05:07.020> proceeding

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
off it and the pitch has been proceeding

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.730 
off it and the pitch has been proceeding
since<00:05:07.920> 1930<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:09.210> fool<00:05:09.960> out<00:05:10.140> of<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.380> bottom<00:05:10.650> of

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
since 1930 to fool out of the bottom of

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.950 
since 1930 to fool out of the bottom of
the<00:05:10.830> funnel<00:05:11.240> except<00:05:12.240> it's<00:05:12.360> falling<00:05:12.600> out<00:05:12.690> very

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
the funnel except it's falling out very

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.340 
the funnel except it's falling out very
slowly<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.830> past<00:05:13.980> 81<00:05:14.990> years<00:05:15.990> we've

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
slowly so in the past 81 years we've

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.040 
slowly so in the past 81 years we've
seen<00:05:16.530> eight<00:05:16.770> drops<00:05:17.070> fall<00:05:17.370> out<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:18.660> if<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:18.930> go

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
seen eight drops fall out and if you go

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.330 
seen eight drops fall out and if you go
and<00:05:19.110> look<00:05:19.200> at<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.530> it<00:05:19.620> certainly<00:05:19.770> looks<00:05:20.100> like<00:05:20.220> a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
and look at it it certainly looks like a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.960 
and look at it it certainly looks like a
solid<00:05:21.170> right<00:05:22.170> but<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:22.980> is<00:05:23.100> dropping<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:23.880> the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
solid right but it is dropping so the

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.250 
solid right but it is dropping so the
seventh<00:05:24.270> drop<00:05:24.510> fell<00:05:24.750> in<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:24.960> middle<00:05:25.170> of<00:05:25.200> the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
seventh drop fell in the middle of the

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.140 
seventh drop fell in the middle of the
world<00:05:25.500> world's<00:05:25.950> expo<00:05:26.340> in<00:05:26.400> 1988<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.880> what<00:05:30.030> does

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
world world's expo in 1988 so what does

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.030 
world world's expo in 1988 so what does
that<00:05:30.210> what<00:05:30.780> does<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.960> all<00:05:31.050> mean<00:05:31.080> bin<00:05:31.680> does<00:05:31.950> that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
that what does it all mean bin does that

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.580 
that what does it all mean bin does that
mean<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.340> is<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:33.150> is<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.330> liquid<00:05:33.540> oh<00:05:33.930> it's<00:05:34.260> a<00:05:34.350> very

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
mean it is it is a liquid oh it's a very

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.290 
mean it is it is a liquid oh it's a very
slow-moving<00:05:34.860> solid<00:05:35.490> well<00:05:35.910> another<00:05:36.120> to

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
slow-moving solid well another to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.550 
slow-moving solid well another to
understand<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.810> we<00:05:36.930> have<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.140> understand

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
understand that we have to understand

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.710 
understand that we have to understand
something<00:05:37.860> called<00:05:38.310> viscosity<00:05:38.510> sofas<00:05:39.510> casa

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
something called viscosity sofas casa

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.110 
something called viscosity sofas casa
team<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.260> basically<00:05:40.530> what<00:05:41.040> we<00:05:41.130> as<00:05:41.400> quantity<00:05:42.000> we

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
team is basically what we as quantity we

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.270 
team is basically what we as quantity we
use<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.419> measure<00:05:42.570> how<00:05:43.290> fast<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.830> liquid<00:05:44.130> can

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
use to measure how fast the liquid can

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.970 
use to measure how fast the liquid can
fly<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.240> water<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.930> has<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.200> very<00:05:46.320> low<00:05:46.530> viscosity

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
fly so water it has a very low viscosity

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.820 
fly so water it has a very low viscosity
so<00:05:47.580> if<00:05:47.700> you<00:05:47.820> pull<00:05:48.270> your<00:05:48.810> water<00:05:49.410> after<00:05:49.680> your

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
so if you pull your water after your

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.140 
so if you pull your water after your
glass<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.130> falls<00:05:50.310> straight<00:05:50.520> onto<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.910> flow

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
glass it falls straight onto the flow

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.630 
glass it falls straight onto the flow
onto<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.840> floor<00:05:52.050> sorry<00:05:52.350> treacle<00:05:53.160> on<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
onto the floor sorry treacle on the

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.040 
onto the floor sorry treacle on the
other<00:05:53.760> hand<00:05:53.850> is<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.240> slightly<00:05:54.570> more<00:05:54.750> viscous

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
other hand is a slightly more viscous

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.740 
other hand is a slightly more viscous
material<00:05:55.980> and<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:57.060> would<00:05:57.150> take<00:05:57.330> longer

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
material and so that would take longer

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.520 
material and so that would take longer
to<00:05:57.990> fly<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:59.250> pitch<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.970> far<00:06:00.210> far<00:06:00.450> more<00:06:00.530> viscous

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
to fly and pitch is far far more viscous

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.409 
to fly and pitch is far far more viscous
and<00:06:01.830> either<00:06:01.919> of<00:06:02.040> those<00:06:02.190> so<00:06:02.430> it's<00:06:02.520> it's

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
and either of those so it's it's

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.420 
and either of those so it's it's
something<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.720> 10<00:06:04.110> billion<00:06:04.440> times<00:06:04.950> as

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
something like 10 billion times as

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.760 
something like 10 billion times as
viscous<00:06:06.030> as<00:06:07.280> water<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:09.290> so<00:06:10.290> it's<00:06:10.410> light<00:06:10.590> it's

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
viscous as water and so it's light it's

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.900 
viscous as water and so it's light it's
flowing<00:06:11.100> incredibly<00:06:11.700> incredibly<00:06:12.210> slowly<00:06:13.910> but

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
flowing incredibly incredibly slowly but

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.659 
flowing incredibly incredibly slowly but
given<00:06:15.300> that<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:15.510> does<00:06:15.690> flow<00:06:16.020> at<00:06:16.169> all<00:06:16.640> does<00:06:17.640> it

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
given that it does flow at all does it

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.460 
given that it does flow at all does it
make<00:06:17.880> it<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.090> liquid<00:06:18.419> or<00:06:18.450> is<00:06:18.660> that<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.840> giant

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
make it a liquid or is that the giant

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.409 
make it a liquid or is that the giant
conundrum<00:06:19.950> well<00:06:20.430> it's<00:06:20.640> neither<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:21.000> liquid

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
conundrum well it's neither a liquid

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.130 
conundrum well it's neither a liquid
Nora<00:06:21.750> solid<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.710> has<00:06:22.740> glass<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.760> a<00:06:24.140> different

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
Nora solid it has glass is a different

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.659 
Nora solid it has glass is a different
thing<00:06:25.200> from<00:06:25.380> either<00:06:25.680> of<00:06:25.800> those<00:06:26.010> is<00:06:26.340> there<00:06:26.640> a

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
thing from either of those is there a

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.270 
thing from either of those is there a
name<00:06:26.850> for<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.240> plus<00:06:28.020> I<00:06:29.510> did<00:06:30.510> ask<00:06:30.660> for<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.280> so

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
name for it plus I did ask for that so

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.159 
name for it plus I did ask for that so
so<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:32.970> it<00:06:33.240> has<00:06:33.330> some<00:06:33.480> very<00:06:33.630> strange<00:06:33.930> other

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
so so it has some very strange other

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.600 
so so it has some very strange other
prophecies<00:06:34.530> for<00:06:34.860> example<00:06:35.220> if<00:06:35.340> you<00:06:35.430> were<00:06:35.520> to

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
prophecies for example if you were to

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.310 
prophecies for example if you were to
try<00:06:35.789> and<00:06:35.880> measure<00:06:36.030> its<00:06:36.300> temperature<00:06:36.780> it's

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
try and measure its temperature it's

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.740 
try and measure its temperature it's
incredibly<00:06:38.250> difficult<00:06:38.400> in<00:06:39.150> fact<00:06:39.390> we<00:06:39.630> don't

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
incredibly difficult in fact we don't

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.040 
incredibly difficult in fact we don't
even

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
even

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.689 
even
really<00:06:40.319> understand<00:06:40.830> what<00:06:41.069> temperature<00:06:41.490> means

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
really understand what temperature means

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.390 
really understand what temperature means
in<00:06:41.940> a<00:06:42.000> glass<00:06:42.240> so<00:06:43.139> if<00:06:44.009> I<00:06:44.099> measure<00:06:44.280> the

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
in a glass so if I measure the

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.339 
in a glass so if I measure the
temperature<00:06:44.849> of<00:06:44.879> a<00:06:45.000> liquid<00:06:45.180> say<00:06:45.629> I<00:06:45.870> could<00:06:46.229> do

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
temperature of a liquid say I could do

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:47.450 
temperature of a liquid say I could do
it<00:06:46.470> with<00:06:46.620> several<00:06:46.919> different<00:06:47.190> types<00:06:47.340> of

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
it with several different types of

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.550 
it with several different types of
experiments<00:06:47.819> and<00:06:48.270> each<00:06:48.509> one<00:06:48.960> ever<00:06:49.110> experiment

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
experiments and each one ever experiment

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.710 
experiments and each one ever experiment
I<00:06:49.590> did<00:06:49.770> they<00:06:49.949> would<00:06:50.069> always<00:06:50.310> give<00:06:50.520> me<00:06:50.699> this<00:06:51.300> the

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
I did they would always give me this the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.439 
I did they would always give me this the
same<00:06:51.960> answer<00:06:52.409> but<00:06:53.039> i<00:06:53.099> did<00:06:53.280> it<00:06:53.370> with<00:06:53.490> an<00:06:53.970> i<00:06:54.330> try

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
same answer but i did it with an i try

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.610 
same answer but i did it with an i try
to<00:06:54.509> measure<00:06:54.690> the<00:06:54.870> temperature<00:06:55.259> of<00:06:55.289> a<00:06:55.379> glass

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
to measure the temperature of a glass

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.770 
to measure the temperature of a glass
I'd<00:06:56.430> get<00:06:56.699> different<00:06:57.000> answers<00:06:57.210> depending<00:06:57.449> on

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 
I'd get different answers depending on

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.830 
I'd get different answers depending on
what<00:06:57.930> type<00:06:58.080> of<00:06:58.110> experiments<00:06:58.800> I<00:06:58.889> did<00:06:59.120> so<00:07:00.120> some

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
what type of experiments I did so some

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.050 
what type of experiments I did so some
of<00:07:00.870> these<00:07:01.020> some<00:07:01.470> of<00:07:01.560> the<00:07:01.669> atoms<00:07:02.669> I<00:07:02.819> mentioned

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
of these some of the atoms I mentioned

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.210 
of these some of the atoms I mentioned
before<00:07:03.120> moving<00:07:03.479> very<00:07:03.629> fast<00:07:03.930> survey<00:07:04.590> if<00:07:05.069> I

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
before moving very fast survey if I

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.399 
before moving very fast survey if I
looked<00:07:05.430> just<00:07:06.060> at<00:07:06.180> those<00:07:06.300> atoms<00:07:06.659> I'd<00:07:06.900> get<00:07:07.080> a<00:07:07.110> get

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
looked just at those atoms I'd get a get

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.460 
looked just at those atoms I'd get a get
a<00:07:07.440> much<00:07:07.650> higher<00:07:07.860> temperature<00:07:09.229> whereas<00:07:10.229> if<00:07:10.349> you

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
a much higher temperature whereas if you

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.219 
a much higher temperature whereas if you
sample<00:07:10.979> at<00:07:11.430> low<00:07:11.639> frequencies<00:07:12.360> which<00:07:12.719> is<00:07:12.870> what

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
sample at low frequencies which is what

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:17.300 
sample at low frequencies which is what
most<00:07:13.379> of<00:07:13.560> the<00:07:13.620> atoms<00:07:13.860> are<00:07:15.050> moving<00:07:16.050> out<00:07:16.349> then

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
most of the atoms are moving out then

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.820 
most of the atoms are moving out then
are<00:07:17.699> then<00:07:18.539> you'd<00:07:18.690> see<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:19.020> temperature<00:07:19.440> at

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
are then you'd see the temperature at

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.640 
are then you'd see the temperature at
the<00:07:19.979> end<00:07:20.099> of<00:07:20.340> the<00:07:20.729> ambien<00:07:21.229> surrounds<00:07:22.229> so

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
the end of the ambien surrounds so

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.140 
the end of the ambien surrounds so
that's<00:07:22.800> why<00:07:22.919> when<00:07:23.069> you<00:07:23.159> pick<00:07:23.340> up<00:07:23.460> a<00:07:23.610> glass<00:07:24.030> of

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
that's why when you pick up a glass of

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.550 
that's why when you pick up a glass of
your<00:07:24.389> hand<00:07:24.539> it<00:07:24.690> feels<00:07:24.719> like<00:07:25.050> it's<00:07:25.229> at<00:07:25.319> the<00:07:25.379> same

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
your hand it feels like it's at the same

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.020 
your hand it feels like it's at the same
time<00:07:25.710> for<00:07:25.860> sure<00:07:25.949> as<00:07:26.009> everything<00:07:26.310> else<00:07:26.430> that's

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
time for sure as everything else that's

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.399 
time for sure as everything else that's
because<00:07:27.240> your<00:07:27.360> hand<00:07:27.569> the<00:07:27.960> things<00:07:28.169> in<00:07:28.319> your

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.409 
because your hand the things in your

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:29.570 
because your hand the things in your
hand<00:07:28.620> that<00:07:28.680> measure<00:07:28.949> temperature<00:07:29.430> a

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
hand that measure temperature a

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.719 
hand that measure temperature a
particular<00:07:30.330> kind<00:07:30.479> of<00:07:30.629> thermometer<00:07:31.400> I'm<00:07:32.400> never

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 
particular kind of thermometer I'm never

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.439 
particular kind of thermometer I'm never
going<00:07:33.000> to<00:07:33.030> look<00:07:33.270> at<00:07:33.479> my<00:07:33.629> glass<00:07:33.900> the<00:07:34.199> same<00:07:34.440> way

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449 
going to look at my glass the same way

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.730 
going to look at my glass the same way
