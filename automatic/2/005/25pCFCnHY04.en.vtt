CPU<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> mob<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.530> randomly<00:00:58.980> spawns

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
CPU there is a mob that randomly spawns

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.569

a<00:01:02.670> spawn<00:01:03.000> egg<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> mob<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a spawn egg for but there is a mob I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.560 
a spawn egg for but there is a mob I
know<00:01:06.510> there's<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> mob<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.229> saw<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> video

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
know there's a mob I saw the video

this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> spawner<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.119> I've<00:01:12.210> been

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
this is the spawner because I've been

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
this is the spawner because I've been
tap<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> ground<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> nothing<00:01:13.530> happens

to craft the sonic screwdriver

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.289 
to craft the sonic screwdriver
you<00:01:39.900> will<00:01:40.049> need<00:01:40.229> six<00:01:41.070> iron<00:01:41.369> ingots<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> three

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you will need six iron ingots and three

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630 
you will need six iron ingots and three
Daleks<00:01:42.689> EPS<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.259> again<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.799> Dalek<00:01:44.159> CPUs

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
Daleks EPS that again to get Dalek CPUs

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.130 
Daleks EPS that again to get Dalek CPUs
you<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> kill<00:01:45.329> Dalek<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.930> he's<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you need to kill Dalek and he's a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.030 
you need to kill Dalek and he's a
randomly<00:01:46.560> spawning<00:01:46.950> mob<00:01:47.880> which<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.329> can't<00:01:48.630> find

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
randomly spawning mob which I can't find

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
randomly spawning mob which I can't find
it<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.310> better<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.880> spawn<00:01:51.479> him

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it would be better if you can spawn him

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410 
it would be better if you can spawn him
somehow<00:01:52.680> someway<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.520> there'll<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.149> something

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
somehow someway or there'll be something

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120 
somehow someway or there'll be something
called<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.780> Dalek<00:01:55.200> spawner<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
called like Dalek spawner if there is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.780 
called like Dalek spawner if there is
one<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.750> can't<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.409> can't<00:01:58.560> find<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.130> but

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
one I can't I really can't find one but

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.260 
one I can't I really can't find one but
see<00:01:59.939> him

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
see him

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
see him
so<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> craft<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.890> TARDIS<00:02:02.430> oh<00:02:02.640> yeah<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> what

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so to craft the TARDIS oh yeah and what

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.469 
so to craft the TARDIS oh yeah and what
the<00:02:03.240> sonic<00:02:03.540> screwdriver<00:02:03.659> does<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.590> mines

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the sonic screwdriver does is it mines

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.940 
the sonic screwdriver does is it mines
every<00:02:06.479> block<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> doesn't<00:02:07.680> give<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.920> what

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
every block but it doesn't give you what

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029 
every block but it doesn't give you what
it<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.629> I<00:02:09.629> crashed<00:02:09.989> once<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.410> use<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.770> for

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it is so I crashed once I use this for

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
it is so I crashed once I use this for
once<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> doesn't<00:02:12.480> crash<00:02:12.750> me

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
once but then now it doesn't crash me

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.730 
once but then now it doesn't crash me
anymore<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:13.470> but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
anymore so yeah but

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
anymore so yeah but
still<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.220> mines<00:02:14.610> every<00:02:14.970> block<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.570> don't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
still in mines every block but you don't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.120 
still in mines every block but you don't
get<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.560> mining<00:02:16.950> tool

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
get it so it's just a little mining tool

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.800 
get it so it's just a little mining tool
if<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.240> get<00:02:18.570> away<00:02:18.780> that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
if you want to you know get away that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
if you want to you know get away that
pesky<00:02:19.230> gravel<00:02:19.890> okay<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.240> next<00:02:21.360> up<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
pesky gravel okay so next up we have the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.150 
pesky gravel okay so next up we have the
TARDIS<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.440> craft<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.460> TARDIS<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:25.290> are<00:02:25.650> going

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
TARDIS to craft the TARDIS you are going

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.720 
TARDIS to craft the TARDIS you are going
to<00:02:26.280> need<00:02:26.430> six<00:02:27.330> lapis<00:02:27.750> lazuli<00:02:27.900> 's<00:02:28.430> and/or<00:02:29.430> lapis

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to need six lapis lazuli 's and/or lapis

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.900 
to need six lapis lazuli 's and/or lapis
lazuli<00:02:29.820> blocks<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.780> three<00:02:31.580> Dalek<00:02:32.580> CPUs

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
lazuli blocks and three Dalek CPUs

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.040 
lazuli blocks and three Dalek CPUs
that's<00:02:33.090> pretty<00:02:33.300> cheap<00:02:33.480> that's<00:02:33.630> pretty<00:02:33.840> cheap

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
that's pretty cheap that's pretty cheap

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.490 
that's pretty cheap that's pretty cheap
so<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.070> don't<00:02:35.400> watch<00:02:35.520> Doctor<00:02:35.880> Who<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.900> once<00:02:37.350> you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
so I don't watch Doctor Who but once you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.690 
so I don't watch Doctor Who but once you
get<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.860> TARDIS<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:38.340> gonna<00:02:38.460> want<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
get the TARDIS you're gonna want to

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.340 
get the TARDIS you're gonna want to
place<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.780> looks<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.260> that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
place it down it looks just like that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.110 
place it down it looks just like that
just<00:02:40.650> looks<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.400> no<00:02:41.550> big<00:02:41.760> deal

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
just looks like that it's no big deal

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.890 
just looks like that it's no big deal
but<00:02:42.780> suppose<00:02:43.200> lean<00:02:43.530> Doctor<00:02:43.980> Who<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
but suppose lean Doctor Who it's a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.080 
but suppose lean Doctor Who it's a
time-traveling<00:02:45.900> thing<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.100> what<00:02:47.880> you're

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
time-traveling thing so what you're

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.540 
time-traveling thing so what you're
basically<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.780> gonna<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:50.400> like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
basically what I'm gonna do is see like

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.250 
basically what I'm gonna do is see like
look<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.880> look<00:02:51.120> what's<00:02:51.750> inside<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.080> it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
look at the look what's inside of it

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
look at the look what's inside of it
it's<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:53.100> really<00:02:53.460> small<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.060> looks<00:02:54.210> really

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
it's it's really small it looks really

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's it's really small it looks really
small<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:55.950> is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
small but then what you want to do is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.860 
small but then what you want to do is
you<00:02:56.130> want<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.370> tap<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:57.540> bam

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you want to tap on it and then bam

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.530 
you want to tap on it and then bam
you're<00:02:58.560> inside<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.790> TARDIS<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.240> it's

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you're inside of the TARDIS and it's

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.050 
you're inside of the TARDIS and it's
really<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.110> really<00:03:01.410> cool<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.370> yeah<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.910> right

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
really it's really cool so yeah so right

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
really it's really cool so yeah so right
here<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.780> ender<00:03:04.140> chest<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
here we have the ender chest is the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.350 
here we have the ender chest is the
ender<00:03:04.950> chest<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.640> right<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:06.090> have

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
ender chest and then right here we have

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.070 
ender chest and then right here we have
the<00:03:07.220> fast-forward<00:03:08.220> slow<00:03:08.910> motion<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.540> neutral

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
the fast-forward slow motion and neutral

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.890 
the fast-forward slow motion and neutral
the<00:03:10.740> time<00:03:11.130> zones<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.580> then<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:12.000> daylight

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the time zones and then we have daylight

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
the time zones and then we have daylight
sensor<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.620> night<00:03:13.830> time<00:03:14.040> sensor<00:03:14.460> which<00:03:14.640> you

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
sensor in a night time sensor which you

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.280 
sensor in a night time sensor which you
can<00:03:14.940> switch<00:03:15.150> days<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.630> stuff<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.110> I'm<00:03:16.170> going

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
can switch days and stuff so I'm going

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.840 
can switch days and stuff so I'm going
to<00:03:16.320> showcase<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:16.830> first<00:03:17.160> you're<00:03:17.670> gonna<00:03:17.730> want

to click on that there's a daylight

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.720 
to click on that there's a daylight
sensor<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.800> get<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.310> TARDIS<00:03:20.580> you're

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
sensor to get out of the TARDIS you're

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.370 
sensor to get out of the TARDIS you're
gonna<00:03:20.940> click<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.240> middle<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.690> then<00:03:22.080> BAM

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
gonna click the middle and then BAM

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.230 
gonna click the middle and then BAM
you're<00:03:22.800> out<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> TARDIS<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.730> oh<00:03:23.910> it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
you're out the TARDIS and it is oh it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.880 
you're out the TARDIS and it is oh it
really<00:03:24.630> was<00:03:24.840> day<00:03:25.080> but<00:03:25.260> let<00:03:25.350> me<00:03:25.410> get<00:03:25.560> back<00:03:25.680> into

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
really was day but let me get back into

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.820 
really was day but let me get back into
the<00:03:26.040> TARDIS<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.550> let<00:03:27.540> me<00:03:27.630> click<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.080> night<00:03:28.650> so

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.470 
the TARDIS and let me click and night so
there<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.010> clicked<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.460> let<00:03:29.880> me<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.150> out<00:03:30.270> and

it back in there
go<00:04:27.539> into<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> TARDIS<00:04:28.259> is<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.560> there<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.919> is

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
go into the TARDIS is it there it is

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.370 
go into the TARDIS is it there it is
there<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.699> is<00:04:29.819> so<00:04:30.030> cool<00:04:30.300> that's<00:04:30.780> like<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.080> mini

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.070 
little ender chest for you now last but
not<00:04:34.080> least<00:04:34.289> we<00:04:34.410> have<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:35.870> fast-forward<00:04:36.870> slow

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
not least we have the fast-forward slow

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.260 
not least we have the fast-forward slow
motion<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.500> neutral<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.099> time<00:04:38.490> extenders<00:04:39.150> or

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
motion and neutral the time extenders or

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.870 
motion and neutral the time extenders or
whatever<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.630> heck<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.650> f<00:04:40.889> stands<00:04:41.759> for

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
whatever the heck it is so f stands for

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.219 
whatever the heck it is so f stands for
fast-forward<00:04:42.509> so<00:04:42.630> when<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.840> click<00:04:43.050> it

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
fast-forward so when you click it

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.930 
fast-forward so when you click it
everything's<00:04:43.979> like<00:04:44.099> super<00:04:44.430> fast<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:44.849> it's

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
how fast it is I think it's oh I'm stuck

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.670 
how fast it is I think it's oh I'm stuck
in<00:04:52.530> flying<00:04:52.770> I'm<00:04:53.069> stuck<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.849> flying<00:04:54.090> how<00:04:54.840> do<00:04:55.349> how

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
in flying I'm stuck in flying how do how

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.740 
in flying I'm stuck in flying how do how
does<00:04:55.740> somebody<00:04:56.039> get<00:04:56.250> stuck<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.699> flying<00:04:57.030> it

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
does somebody get stuck in flying it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.939 
does somebody get stuck in flying it
makes<00:04:57.900> no<00:04:58.020> sense<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.349> let<00:04:58.470> me<00:04:58.530> get<00:04:58.680> back<00:04:58.710> into

makes no sense but let me get back into

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.999 
makes no sense but let me get back into
the<00:04:59.069> TARDIS<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.759> then<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.210> am<00:05:00.360> gonna<00:05:00.570> click

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
the TARDIS and then I am gonna click

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.080 
the TARDIS and then I am gonna click
neutral<00:05:02.009> so<00:05:02.250> what<00:05:02.370> i<00:05:02.400> want<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:02.940> if<00:05:03.030> you
