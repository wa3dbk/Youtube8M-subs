00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
work so I don't know so I was thinking

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.900 
work so I don't know so I was thinking
that<00:04:14.380> if<00:04:15.380> it<00:04:15.620> came<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.860> it<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.459> could<00:04:16.669> always

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
that if it came to it I could always

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.699 
that if it came to it I could always
look<00:04:17.209> she<00:04:17.480> like<00:04:18.140> most<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.859> my<00:04:18.890> head<00:04:19.340> and

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.230 

keep<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.069> little<00:04:22.220> bit<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.430> my<00:04:22.639> hairline<00:04:23.000> even

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
keep a little bit of my hairline even

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.279 
keep a little bit of my hairline even
though<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.419> kind<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.660> look<00:04:23.780> probably<00:04:24.110> pretty

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
though that kind of look probably pretty

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.860 
though that kind of look probably pretty
freaky<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.610> then<00:04:25.940> so<00:04:26.120> if<00:04:26.180> we're<00:04:26.389> all<00:04:26.509> my<00:04:26.660> wigs

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
freaky and then so if we're all my wigs

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.710 
freaky and then so if we're all my wigs
and<00:04:27.080> then<00:04:27.169> maybe<00:04:27.350> get<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.590> gripper<00:04:27.949> from<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
and then maybe get a gripper from the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.110 
and then maybe get a gripper from the
Lea<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.190> wasn't<00:04:31.430> sure<00:04:31.639> how<00:04:31.789> that<00:04:32.000> would

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
Lea but I wasn't sure how that would

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.950 
Lea but I wasn't sure how that would
work<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.979> tried<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.490> gripper<00:04:34.940> when<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.690> was

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
work so I tried on a gripper when I was

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.930 
work so I tried on a gripper when I was
there<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:38.060> kind<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.330> as<00:04:38.479> an<00:04:38.630> experiment<00:04:39.940> it

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
there just kind of as an experiment it

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.469 
there just kind of as an experiment it
was<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.419> gripper<00:04:41.780> cool<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:43.190> think<00:04:43.729> was<00:04:43.849> cool<00:04:44.150> it

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
was the gripper cool I think was cool it

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.710 
was the gripper cool I think was cool it
did<00:04:44.870> not<00:04:44.900> have<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:46.030> silicone<00:04:47.030> on<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.240> wet<00:04:47.419> so

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
did not have the silicone on the wet so

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.110 
did not have the silicone on the wet so
I<00:04:48.009> think<00:04:49.009> its<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> sport<00:04:49.669> that<00:04:49.819> has<00:04:49.880> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
I think its the sport that has the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.330 
I think its the sport that has the
silicon<00:04:50.419> oh<00:04:50.509> so<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.110> was<00:04:51.259> only<00:04:51.380> on<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.740> top

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
silicon oh so it was only on the top

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.610 
silicon oh so it was only on the top
size<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.910> nape<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.360> for<00:04:53.900> some<00:04:54.080> reason<00:04:54.110> I

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
size and nape and for some reason I

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.110 
size and nape and for some reason I
thought<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.889> wouldn't<00:04:55.220> be<00:04:55.310> able<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.580> try<00:04:55.849> on<00:04:56.090> a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
thought I wouldn't be able to try on a

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.240 
thought I wouldn't be able to try on a
gripper<00:04:56.570> because<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.050> we<00:04:57.139> gained<00:04:57.320> my<00:04:57.979> hair<00:04:58.220> out

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
gripper because it we gained my hair out

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.400 
gripper because it we gained my hair out
maybe<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.970> because<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.419> short<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.990> doesn't

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
maybe it's because it's short it doesn't

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.400 
maybe it's because it's short it doesn't
tug<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:01.009> but<00:05:01.789> that<00:05:02.210> sucker<00:05:02.840> stays<00:05:03.259> on

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
tug on it but that sucker stays on

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.260 
tug on it but that sucker stays on
pretty<00:05:03.740> good<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.460> not<00:05:04.729> have<00:05:04.880> some<00:05:05.090> hair

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
pretty good and I not have some hair

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.890 
pretty good and I not have some hair
right<00:05:05.479> now<00:05:05.570> so<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:06.050> definitely<00:05:06.770> see<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.460> I<00:05:08.120> we

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
right now so I definitely see it I we

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.420 
right now so I definitely see it I we
even<00:05:09.080> folded<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.530> lace<00:05:09.710> back<00:05:09.949> a<00:05:09.979> little<00:05:10.250> bit

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
even folded the lace back a little bit

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.570 
even folded the lace back a little bit
and<00:05:10.669> I<00:05:11.060> put<00:05:11.690> it<00:05:11.810> slightly<00:05:11.990> behind<00:05:12.440> my<00:05:12.919> my

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
and I put it slightly behind my my

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.749 
and I put it slightly behind my my
hairline<00:05:13.940> so<00:05:14.330> if<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:14.840> lace<00:05:15.020> was<00:05:15.259> cut<00:05:15.560> and<00:05:15.860> it

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
hairline so if the lace was cut and it

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.409 
hairline so if the lace was cut and it
was<00:05:16.909> the<00:05:17.150> proper<00:05:17.539> size<00:05:18.340> cap<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.759> definitely

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
was the proper size cap I definitely

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.499 
was the proper size cap I definitely
think<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.080> possibility<00:05:21.740> totally<00:05:22.190> doable<00:05:22.520> to

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
think the possibility totally doable to

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.200 
think the possibility totally doable to
have<00:05:23.870> as<00:05:24.349> an<00:05:24.470> option<00:05:24.889> down<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.190> line

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
have as an option down the line

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.820 
have as an option down the line
if<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:26.840> gets<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.139> that<00:05:28.960> but<00:05:29.960> hopefully

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
if it gets to that but hopefully

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.460 
if it gets to that but hopefully
I<00:05:32.300> won't<00:05:33.300> have<00:05:33.420> to<00:05:33.570> take<00:05:34.020> such<00:05:34.230> drastic

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
I won't have to take such drastic

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.980 
I won't have to take such drastic
measures<00:05:35.150> but<00:05:36.150> if<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.330> do<00:05:36.390> i<00:05:36.540> do<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.780> mean

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
measures but if I do i do I mean

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.870 
measures but if I do i do I mean
whatever<00:05:37.260> okay<00:05:37.770> see<00:05:38.160> this<00:05:38.610> is<00:05:38.670> what<00:05:38.850> happens
