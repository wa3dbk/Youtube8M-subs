00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
range seem to find myself out here the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.269 
range seem to find myself out here the
range<00:00:15.690> quite<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> bit<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.410> that's<00:00:16.680> cool<00:00:16.949> we

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
range quite a bit and that's cool we

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.040 
range quite a bit and that's cool we
like<00:00:17.460> being<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> range<00:00:18.090> hard<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> get

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
like being at the range hard to get

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
like being at the range hard to get
better<00:00:19.170> shooting<00:00:19.560> unless<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.580> range

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
better shooting unless you go to a range

what<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> defined<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.039> four

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
what it is how I defined it the four

what it is how I defined it the four
components<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.779> those<00:00:30.869> being<00:00:31.109> movements

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
components one of those being movements

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
components one of those being movements
okay<00:00:32.180> making<00:00:33.180> effective<00:00:33.570> engagements<00:00:34.260> while

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
okay making effective engagements while

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.760 
okay making effective engagements while
moving<00:00:34.829> most<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.880> our<00:00:36.000> shooting<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> move

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770

our<00:00:37.770> heels<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.579> hitting<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> ground<00:00:39.030> first

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
our heels are hitting the ground first

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
our heels are hitting the ground first
we're<00:00:39.480> rather<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:41.250> pretty<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.520> we're

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we're rather and pretty much we're

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
we're rather and pretty much we're
moving<00:00:42.329> towards<00:00:42.629> targets<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.379> straight

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
moving towards targets that are straight

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
moving towards targets that are straight
in<00:00:43.710> front<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.980> us<00:00:44.100> targets<00:00:44.910> their<00:00:45.030> oblique<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in front of us targets their oblique to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.200 
in front of us targets their oblique to
us<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:46.260> completely<00:00:46.710> lateral<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> us<00:00:47.460> generally

our<00:00:48.329> feet<00:00:48.690> hit<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> ground<00:00:48.930> heel<00:00:49.410> first<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
our feet hit the ground heel first and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
our feet hit the ground heel first and
we're<00:00:50.430> able<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.510> knees<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> kind<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
we're able to use our knees to kind of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.689 
we're able to use our knees to kind of
isolate<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.860> gun<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.280> impact<00:00:53.399> by

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
isolate the gun from that impact by

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
isolate the gun from that impact by
absorbing<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.510> impact<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> rolling<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> out

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
absorbing that impact and rolling it out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.580 
absorbing that impact and rolling it out
to<00:00:55.949> our<00:00:56.010> toes<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.579> suddenly<00:00:57.570> arm<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:58.140> our<00:00:58.320> last

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to our toes a suddenly arm in our last

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
to our toes a suddenly arm in our last
episode<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.609> talked<00:00:59.850> about<00:00:59.910> having<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> sensor

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
episode we talked about having a sensor

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.009 
episode we talked about having a sensor
in<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.440> heel<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:03.329> feet<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.750> always

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
in our heel well my feet don't always

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
in our heel well my feet don't always
hit<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> ground<00:01:04.739> heel<00:01:04.949> first<00:01:05.280> okay<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.030> we

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
hit the ground heel first okay so we

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
hit the ground heel first okay so we
need<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> look<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.750> maybe<00:01:06.900> having<00:01:07.229> sensors<00:01:07.590> all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
need to look at maybe having sensors all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.000 
need to look at maybe having sensors all
over<00:01:07.890> our<00:01:08.610> feet<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:10.010> better

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
over our feet so that we can better

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
over our feet so that we can better
absorb<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:12.000> impact<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.780> can

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
absorb that impact so that we can

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
absorb that impact so that we can
isolate<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.680> gun<00:01:13.890> from<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.670> impact<00:01:14.820> okay<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
isolate the gun from that impact okay so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
isolate the gun from that impact okay so
I've<00:01:16.080> got<00:01:16.229> another<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:16.860> shooting<00:01:17.310> on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I've got another one of my shooting on

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
I've got another one of my shooting on
the<00:01:17.460> move<00:01:17.610> exercises<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.509> called<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the move exercises I called this one the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160 
the move exercises I called this one the
focus<00:01:19.650> monster<00:01:20.420> first<00:01:21.420> time<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> shot<00:01:21.840> a

focus monster first time I shot a
variation<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> six<00:01:23.580> hour

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759

to another thing that's working for us

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
to another thing that's working for us
there<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> awareness<00:01:50.030> in<00:01:51.030> my<00:01:51.180> courses<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
there is awareness in my courses I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.969 
there is awareness in my courses I
talked<00:01:51.810> quite<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> bit<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.290> focus<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
talked quite a bit about focus and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.139 
talked quite a bit about focus and
awareness<00:01:53.040> how<00:01:53.490> we're<00:01:53.640> built<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> receive

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
awareness how we're built to receive

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
awareness how we're built to receive
information<00:01:54.329> how<00:01:54.990> quickly<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.590> process

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
information how quickly we can process

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.170 
information how quickly we can process
it<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.670> absorb<00:01:56.939> other

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it and how we can absorb other

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.840 
it and how we can absorb other
information<00:01:57.780> through<00:01:57.960> awareness<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:59.399> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
information through awareness in this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
information through awareness in this
case<00:02:00.180> moving<00:02:00.750> through<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.140> barrels

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
case moving through these barrels

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.899 
case moving through these barrels
awareness<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> what's<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.850> us

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
awareness is what's going to get us

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
awareness is what's going to get us
around<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.930> barrels<00:02:04.320> without<00:02:04.560> making

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
around these barrels without making

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
around these barrels without making
contact<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.119> absolutely

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
contact with them is that's absolutely

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
contact with them is that's absolutely
gonna<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> goal<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> way<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
gonna be a goal so the way the thing is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.529 
gonna be a goal so the way the thing is
going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.700> down<00:02:08.910> we're<00:02:09.060> gonna<00:02:09.119> start<00:02:09.450> at

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
going to go down we're gonna start at

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.420 
going to go down we're gonna start at
that<00:02:09.629> back<00:02:09.869> cone<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:10.860> about<00:02:11.009> 15

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that back cone you know we're about 15

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.830 
that back cone you know we're about 15
yards<00:02:11.580> away<00:02:11.819> from<00:02:12.060> those<00:02:12.180> targets<00:02:12.599> I've<00:02:12.690> got

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
yards away from those targets I've got

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.089 
yards away from those targets I've got
five<00:02:13.319> targets<00:02:13.709> up<00:02:13.830> there

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
five targets up there

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.649 
five targets up there
with<00:02:14.609> eight<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> half<00:02:14.939> by<00:02:15.180> eleven<00:02:15.450> copy

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
with eight and a half by eleven copy

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.479 
with eight and a half by eleven copy
paper<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.140> them<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.469> knit<00:02:16.680> two<00:02:16.829> rounds<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.219> her

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
paper on them we knit two rounds on her

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.069 
paper on them we knit two rounds on her
target<00:02:17.879> while<00:02:18.480> making<00:02:18.810> our<00:02:18.900> way<00:02:19.049> through

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
target while making our way through

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.750 
target while making our way through
these<00:02:19.379> barrels<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.340> we're<00:02:20.430> gonna<00:02:20.549> have<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
these barrels so we're gonna have to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.489 
these barrels so we're gonna have to
move<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.060> absorb<00:02:21.389> impact<00:02:21.780> our<00:02:21.959> feet<00:02:22.170> are

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499 
move and absorb impact our feet are

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.690 
move and absorb impact our feet are
gonna<00:02:22.709> hit<00:02:22.859> the<00:02:22.920> ground<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.400> little<00:02:23.579> bit

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
gonna hit the ground a little bit

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.759 
gonna hit the ground a little bit
different<00:02:24.120> than<00:02:24.329> heal<00:02:24.569> first<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:25.560> right<00:02:25.620> so

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
different than heal first all right so

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.869 
different than heal first all right so
I'm<00:02:25.829> probably<00:02:25.980> gonna<00:02:26.159> start<00:02:26.430> moving<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
I'm probably gonna start moving to the

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.459 
I'm probably gonna start moving to the
left<00:02:26.999> doesn't<00:02:27.510> matter<00:02:27.629> which<00:02:27.810> way<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.049> go

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
left doesn't matter which way you go

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.839 
left doesn't matter which way you go
I'll<00:02:28.709> start<00:02:29.010> moving<00:02:29.249> to<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> left<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.730> we'll

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
I'll start moving to the left and we'll

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.129 
I'll start moving to the left and we'll
come<00:02:30.060> around<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.389> barrel<00:02:30.719> you're<00:02:30.810> gonna<00:02:30.900> see

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
come around this barrel you're gonna see

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.899 
come around this barrel you're gonna see
kind<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.439> how<00:02:31.500> our<00:02:31.530> feet<00:02:31.889> are<00:02:32.219> impacting<00:02:32.819> the

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
kind of how our feet are impacting the

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.339 
kind of how our feet are impacting the
ground<00:02:33.150> all<00:02:33.599> right<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.049> there<00:02:34.319> that

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
ground all right so right there that

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.839 
ground all right so right there that
puts<00:02:34.769> kind<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.129> hitting<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> heel<00:02:35.609> but<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
puts kind of hitting on the heel but the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.610 
puts kind of hitting on the heel but the
side<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.269> our<00:02:36.329> foot<00:02:36.540> has<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.230> absorb<00:02:37.409> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
side of our foot has to absorb that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.379 
side of our foot has to absorb that
impact<00:02:37.769> -<00:02:38.189> all<00:02:38.400> right<00:02:38.519> if<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.879> impact<00:02:39.180> heard

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
impact - all right if the impact heard

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.440 
impact - all right if the impact heard
hit<00:02:40.109> absorb<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.739> impact<00:02:41.150> since<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.239> was<00:02:42.329> kind

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
hit absorb that impact since it was kind

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.520 
hit absorb that impact since it was kind
of<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.719> way<00:02:42.780> through<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.049> foot<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.409> the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
of all the way through the foot so the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.649 
of all the way through the foot so the
knee<00:02:43.680> knows<00:02:43.859> how<00:02:44.069> much<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.519> give<00:02:44.790> okay<00:02:45.180> we're

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
knee knows how much to give okay we're

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.610 
knee knows how much to give okay we're
also<00:02:45.749> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.989> be<00:02:46.079> kind<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.260> moving<00:02:46.530> our

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
also going to be kind of moving our

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.349 
also going to be kind of moving our
upper<00:02:46.859> body<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.129> little<00:02:47.310> bit<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.180> around

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
upper body a little bit in and around

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.390 
upper body a little bit in and around
these<00:02:48.540> barrels<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.169> moving<00:02:50.010> over<00:02:50.159> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
these barrels and moving over a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.069 
these barrels and moving over a
different<00:02:50.790> plane<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.359> it's<00:02:51.629> also<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
different plane there it's also going to

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.959 
different plane there it's also going to
get<00:02:52.230> some<00:02:52.469> more<00:02:52.620> work<00:02:52.889> on<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.250> stabilization

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
get some more work on the stabilization
