hey guys I'm Joe Theo with video thority

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.550 
hey guys I'm Joe Theo with video thority
in<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:02.820> I'm<00:00:02.970> gonna<00:00:03.090> talk<00:00:03.360> about

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
in this video I'm gonna talk about

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.829 
in this video I'm gonna talk about
tentpole<00:00:04.560> programming<00:00:04.879> what<00:00:05.879> it<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.120> how<00:00:06.779> you

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
tentpole programming what it is how you

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.540 
tentpole programming what it is how you
can<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.470> your<00:00:07.620> advantage<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.309> more

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
can use it to your advantage to get more

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.450 
can use it to your advantage to get more
views<00:00:08.940> now<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.750> nutshell<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.920> tentpole

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
views now in a nutshell what tentpole

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.270 
views now in a nutshell what tentpole
programming<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.440> create<00:00:14.099> videos

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
programming is is when you create videos

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.140 
programming is is when you create videos
and<00:00:14.759> content<00:00:15.269> around<00:00:15.839> an<00:00:16.289> upcoming<00:00:16.890> event<00:00:17.430> not

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and content around an upcoming event not

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
and content around an upcoming event not
necessarily<00:00:18.840> something<00:00:19.050> you're<00:00:19.289> doing<00:00:19.500> but

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
necessarily something you're doing but

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
necessarily something you're doing but
for<00:00:20.490> example<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.150> made<00:00:21.420> videos<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:22.109> Windows

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
for example I made videos about Windows

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.730 
for example I made videos about Windows
10<00:00:23.210> approaching<00:00:24.210> its<00:00:24.359> launch<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> reason

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
10 approaching its launch now the reason

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
10 approaching its launch now the reason
it's<00:00:25.890> called<00:00:25.920> tentpole<00:00:26.580> programming<00:00:26.609> is

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
it's called tentpole programming is

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's called tentpole programming is
because<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.130> amount<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.699> buzz<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:31.550> exists

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because the amount of buzz that exists

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.360 
because the amount of buzz that exists
before<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:33.300> event<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.350> increases<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
before an event kind of increases and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.060 
before an event kind of increases and
goes<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.540> hits<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.809> peak<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.380> at

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
goes up and then hits a peak right at

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
goes up and then hits a peak right at
whatever<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.760> event<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.870> goes<00:00:40.110> down

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
whatever the event is and then goes down

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160 
whatever the event is and then goes down
again<00:00:40.649> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> looks<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> tent<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
again kind of looks like a tent so the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 
again kind of looks like a tent so the
whole<00:00:43.379> idea<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.700> advantage<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
whole idea is that you take advantage of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
whole idea is that you take advantage of
the<00:00:45.989> event<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> people<00:00:47.190> talking

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the event and all the people talking

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.610 
the event and all the people talking
about<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.120> searching<00:00:48.600> about<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
about it and searching about it on the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.090 
about it and searching about it on the
upswing<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.739> buzz

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
upswing and then you get all that buzz

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
upswing and then you get all that buzz
and<00:00:53.430> talk<00:00:53.699> about<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> people<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and talk about it and people kind of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.069 
and talk about it and people kind of
just<00:00:55.440> by<00:00:56.129> collateral<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:57.059> at<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.539> video<00:00:57.870> as

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just by collateral look at your video as

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.229 
just by collateral look at your video as
well<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.250> they'll<00:00:59.550> continue<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.120> look

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
well and then they'll continue to look

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
well and then they'll continue to look
at<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> even<00:01:01.260> after<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> event<00:01:01.739> passes<00:01:02.609> but

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
at it even after the event passes but

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.100 
at it even after the event passes but
the<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:03.120> point<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.570> tentpole<00:01:04.080> programming

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the whole point of tentpole programming

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
the whole point of tentpole programming
is<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> upload<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> video<00:01:06.180> before

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is you want to upload the video before

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
is you want to upload the video before
the<00:01:07.110> event<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> event<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.580> after

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the event not all in the event not after

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
the event not all in the event not after
the<00:01:09.090> event<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> talking<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> but

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the event just talking about it but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
the event just talking about it but
before<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.310> because<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.299> you're<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
before it because then you're gonna get

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
before it because then you're gonna get
the<00:01:12.840> maximum<00:01:13.560> exposure<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.760> I'll<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> very

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the maximum exposure so I'll do a very

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.149 
the maximum exposure so I'll do a very
specific<00:01:15.900> example<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.590> actually<00:01:16.740> took

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
specific example I actually took

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.090 
specific example I actually took
advantage<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> tentpole<00:01:18.270> programming<00:01:18.299> ideas

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
advantage of tentpole programming ideas

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
advantage of tentpole programming ideas
for<00:01:20.100> Windows<00:01:20.520> 10<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.150> tech<00:01:21.630> channel<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
for Windows 10 on my tech channel and it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
for Windows 10 on my tech channel and it
was<00:01:22.439> hugely<00:01:22.920> successful<00:01:23.100> I've<00:01:23.700> never<00:01:24.270> seen

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
was hugely successful I've never seen

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.690 
was hugely successful I've never seen
stats<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.110> good<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.890> tech<00:01:26.130> channel<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.549> when

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
stats as good on my tech channel as when

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
stats as good on my tech channel as when
I<00:01:26.729> made<00:01:26.970> those<00:01:27.060> Windows<00:01:27.450> 10<00:01:27.659> videos<00:01:28.020> basically

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
I made those Windows 10 videos basically

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.310 
I made those Windows 10 videos basically
I<00:01:28.860> knew<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.030> Windows<00:01:30.360> 10<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I knew that Windows 10 was gonna be a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
I knew that Windows 10 was gonna be a
huge<00:01:31.740> launch<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.520> something<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
huge launch it's something that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
huge launch it's something that
everyone's<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.869> heard<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:34.170> lots<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
everyone's really heard about lots of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
everyone's really heard about lots of
people<00:01:35.189> talking<00:01:35.460> about<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.150> knew<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
people talking about it and I knew it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
people talking about it and I knew it
was<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.659> July<00:01:36.990> 29th<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.640> weeks<00:01:38.880> leading

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
was on July 29th so in the weeks leading

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480 
was on July 29th so in the weeks leading
up<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.810> made<00:01:40.290> several<00:01:40.619> videos<00:01:41.040> talking

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
up to it I made several videos talking

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
up to it I made several videos talking
about<00:01:41.670> Windows<00:01:42.150> 10<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.630> knew<00:01:42.780> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
about Windows 10 because I knew it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
about Windows 10 because I knew it's
something<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.350> people<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.680> interested<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
something that people are interested in

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
something that people are interested in
now<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.240> especially<00:01:45.780> interested<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
now and will be especially interested in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.010 
now and will be especially interested in
leading<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.909> launch<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> made

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
leading up to the launch so I made

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
leading up to the launch so I made
videos<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> should<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.040> Windows<00:01:50.399> 10

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
videos like should you get Windows 10

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
videos like should you get Windows 10
should<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> clean<00:01:51.720> install<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:52.740> like

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
should you do a clean install stuff like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.300 
should you do a clean install stuff like
that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940 
that
leading<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> sure<00:01:55.140> enough<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.799> see

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
leading up and sure enough you can see

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
leading up and sure enough you can see
that<00:01:56.640> those<00:01:56.820> videos<00:01:57.060> even<00:01:57.689> though<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.200> know

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that those videos even though you know

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
that those videos even though you know
they<00:01:58.469> got<00:01:58.649> moderate<00:01:59.130> views<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> beginning

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
they got moderate views at the beginning

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.569 
they got moderate views at the beginning
as<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.560> Windows<00:02:01.560> 10<00:02:01.590> launch<00:02:02.100> approached

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
as the Windows 10 launch approached

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.600 
as the Windows 10 launch approached
that's<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.200> views<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.610> skyrocketed

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that's when the views really skyrocketed

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.449 
that's when the views really skyrocketed
even<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.240> videos<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.689> were<00:02:07.079> older<00:02:07.680> not

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
even on those videos that were older not

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.729 
even on those videos that were older not
too<00:02:09.030> old<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.539> less<00:02:09.989> than<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> few<00:02:10.379> weeks<00:02:10.500> old

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
too old like less than a few weeks old

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.290 
too old like less than a few weeks old
but<00:02:11.310> they<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> most<00:02:12.390> views

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
but they got the most views

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.510 
but they got the most views
on<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.720> day<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.140> specific<00:02:14.890> day<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
on that day that specific day of the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.310 
on that day that specific day of the
launch<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.910> then<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.300> see<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.600> kind<00:02:17.230> of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
launch and then you can see it kind of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.950 
launch and then you can see it kind of
go<00:02:17.470> down<00:02:17.710> so<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.040> caught<00:02:18.490> all<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.540> buzz<00:02:19.780> about

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
go down so I caught all the buzz about

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.320 
go down so I caught all the buzz about
Windows<00:02:20.410> 10<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> upswing<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.030> collect

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
Windows 10 on the upswing so you collect

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.030 
Windows 10 on the upswing so you collect
all<00:02:22.720> those<00:02:22.990> views<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.560> all<00:02:23.620> those<00:02:23.800> search

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
all those views and all those search

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.430 
all those views and all those search
terms<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.670> get<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.420> maximum<00:02:26.050> amount<00:02:26.170> of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
terms and get the maximum amount of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.530 
terms and get the maximum amount of
exposure<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.640> can<00:02:27.790> do<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.240> any

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
exposure and you can do this with any

leading<00:02:37.450> up<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.590> can<00:02:38.710> get<00:02:39.070> that

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
leading up to it so you can get that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.030 
leading up to it so you can get that

buzz once it happens before and after

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.950 
buzz once it happens before and after
I'm<00:02:42.190> sure<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> lot<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.060> least<00:02:43.240> had<00:02:43.570> kind

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
I'm sure a lot of you at least had kind

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.390 
I'm sure a lot of you at least had kind
of<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.110> idea<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.590> do<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.160> pretty

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
of the idea to do this it's pretty

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.520 
of the idea to do this it's pretty
common<00:02:45.790> sense<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.080> might<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.380> have

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
common sense but you might not have

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.230 
common sense but you might not have
realized<00:02:47.740> just<00:02:48.310> how<00:02:48.460> effective<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.210> is

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
realized just how effective it is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.270 
realized just how effective it is
especially<00:02:50.020> with<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> huge<00:02:50.680> event

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
especially with a huge event

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.430 
especially with a huge event
now<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.580> described<00:02:52.090> uploading<00:02:52.690> videos<00:02:53.020> before

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
now I described uploading videos before

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.920 
now I described uploading videos before
but<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.310> also<00:02:54.460> do<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.790> during<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.540> after

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
but you can also do it during and after

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.020 
but you can also do it during and after
but<00:02:56.470> you're<00:02:56.920> gonna<00:02:57.010> get<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> maximum

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
but you're gonna get the maximum

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.300 
but you're gonna get the maximum
exposure<00:02:58.450> if<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.750> do<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.200> three<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.980> then

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
exposure if you do all three and then

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.500 
exposure if you do all three and then
the<00:03:00.430> good<00:03:00.580> thing<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.330> can

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the good thing about that is you can

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
the good thing about that is you can
actually<00:03:01.660> link<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.290> videos<00:03:02.560> together

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
actually link the videos together

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.290 
actually link the videos together
because<00:03:03.220> they're<00:03:03.400> about<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.730> same<00:03:03.940> thing<00:03:04.150> so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
because they're about the same thing so

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.940 
because they're about the same thing so
you<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.480> say<00:03:04.600> check<00:03:05.140> out<00:03:05.260> my<00:03:05.410> other<00:03:05.530> video<00:03:05.920> on

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
you can say check out my other video on

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.770 
you can say check out my other video on
this<00:03:06.190> topic<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.270> get<00:03:07.390> more<00:03:07.510> watch

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
this topic and you can get more watch

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.870 
this topic and you can get more watch
time<00:03:07.810> we<00:03:08.470> all<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:08.860> from<00:03:09.520> my<00:03:09.670> other<00:03:09.760> videos

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
time we all know from my other videos

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.390 
time we all know from my other videos
watch<00:03:10.750> time<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.110> hugely<00:03:11.500> important<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:12.310> if

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
watch time is hugely important so if

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.800 
watch time is hugely important so if
you've<00:03:12.520> got<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> ton<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.030> videos<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> same

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
you've got a ton of videos on the same

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.690 
you've got a ton of videos on the same
topic<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.500> make<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.680> playlist<00:03:14.950> maybe<00:03:15.370> or

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
topic you can make a playlist maybe or

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.580 
topic you can make a playlist maybe or
at<00:03:16.180> least<00:03:16.390> link<00:03:16.720> between<00:03:16.960> them

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
at least link between them

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.050 
at least link between them
so<00:03:17.860> there's<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.160> ton<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.520> different<00:03:18.700> ways<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
so there's a ton of different ways you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.750 
so there's a ton of different ways you
can<00:03:19.330> take<00:03:19.390> advantage<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.830> big<00:03:21.370> news<00:03:21.730> story

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
can take advantage of a big news story

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.000
