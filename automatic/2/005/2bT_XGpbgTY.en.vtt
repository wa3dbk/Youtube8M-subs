00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hi to you all Slovakia on this video I 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 Today I will show you how to protect your house on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.779
 gacy server 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.109
 I think the corresponding plugin is private 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.689
 nakatomi well for a start we need the same 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 to house a house 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.340
 this line of the fence and the gate is private 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.210
 wait and duck here but there are such people under 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.059
 called griefers on which to privat 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 side and they can and still some 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 in ways 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.610
 ways to disassemble your bags house well and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.289
 take your life for one minecraft and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.840
 let's see here are some ways 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 who how can they do it and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.210
 I will show you how to protect 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.730
 Well, no it is not a trap is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.320
 refers to the materials of which is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.740
 build a house here let's say I imagine 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.610
 In the role of a gripper, for example, 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.070
 standard not build here's a piston 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.560
 ordinary piston that's not sticky 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.619
 the piston as they put it there under 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.440
 whether the oak board still some kind of garbage I do not 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.670
 I know what they put there but usually a board or 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.520
 earth is the cheapest material 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 put along your walls if you have 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.330
 the house is wooden then you are unlucky it 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 the most unreliable house you can safely here 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.300
 look take here set fire this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.190
 elementary board and your home is just 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.789
 everything will flare up but there 20 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.420
 and there is not an hour sucks is this 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.700
 the house will reach fire to the wall and all you 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.490
 the end of here is like now some 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.130
 file boards were like this 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.850
 I think they understood the new but now it's all 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.739
 I'll flood it of course but 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.140
 go to the next house 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.500
 Well, that is, I built this one 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.620
 stone wall she is surely safer 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 much safer but she has 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.840
 corresponding cons let's build 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.850
 here is the same construction here here 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.600
 we will for example the same board 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.959
 spread well here they are of course but 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.799
 inexperienced warmers and they are natural 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.100
 do some bullshit 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.769
 but I will not say I'm not a griffer, but we 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.489
 we lay out but we naturally do not set fire 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.790
 Well, because you know, they can 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:50.329
 do so now look taken i take 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.799
 first dynamite but they can't 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.760
 So step up and that's how it 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.459
 put for example 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.299
 take dynamite just like this 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:02.750
 pushes elementary with the help of boards 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.579
 then these boards are set on fire and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.640
 further you understand dynamite so here 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.590
 inflames and everything he falls down and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 blows up yours against the walls along with the fence 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.709
 at the same time 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.189
 well, let's not torment 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.879
 And so we will set fire to some boards file 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:24.209
 okay blow up our wall and voila here 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.189
 they are already at home you can say you 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 move on to the next wall naturally 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.769
 to build from stone is also rather unreliable 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 go next wall this wall 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.459
 most reliable on of obsidian 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.620
 stand all the fire in others anything so much 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.040
 that griffer its just not overcome well 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.879
 even for those who do not know what is 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.319
 obsidian never used it 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.689
 Now here let 's say I'll build 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.230
 that's the same dynamite after all I 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.030
 I will try to board because I 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.879
 already tried it and did not explode something 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.099
 I do not blow up now and its not this 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.400
 for sitting you can not move the pistons here it is 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:10.719
 harry is burning now i'm gonna light up and 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.889
 obsidian is impossible for no 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.569
 move the piston now it's 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.879
 demonstrated the fence then of course 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.750
 explode correct you recover 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:22.750
 koba no damage it here here on first 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.599
 line of the floor is also better to make obsidian 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.419
 so because the explosion goes a little bit 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:32.050
 next can ruin your floor a little bit 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.440
 and let's demonstrate now so 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.470
 here's the pistons put insert fucking 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.780
 the piston okay how I put it now 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.250
 let's put you touch me okay here 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.580
 So I bit yazvi 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:54.720
 sorry about breaking the wall like this 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.930
 I will take the piston so all now 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.479
 lever 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.340
 and nothing happens this block is impossible 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.699
 move can not blow can not be burned 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 the most reliable unit but look for it 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:11.050
 quite expensive because you need lava 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:15.039
 cave need to go to hell is pretty 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.349
 I know everything for a long time and it is very difficult 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.230
 to get to start you need to find because 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.840
 diamonds so decide what is best for you 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.470
 wooden house but you have not seen yourself 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:33.020
 reliable as a stone house is also not very 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:36.170
 reliable and obs I am oh well and obsidian in 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.880
 home yes but still have servers for 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.780
 but specifically protection for these 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.450
 explosions and plugins specifically so for 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.530
 these servers griffer this one thing 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.380
 useless but if you play on 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.040
 servers where there are no these plug-ins then I think 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.710
 you think it will be very helpful especially 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.430
 built from obsidian at the most reliably 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.340
 and but it's not very beautiful because some 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.590
 love the beauty in the house I don't know who but 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.650
 many love beauty and now i will show 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.800
 how to arrange this beauty 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.470
 dear friends now I'll show you 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.820
 how is it all done here is how 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.560
 called a sandwich so let's say here 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.320
 the rippers well nothing suspects but 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.710
 think an hour well in the same way as 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.010
 over there it was shown to be burning sasha this and all 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.900
 and get home but unfortunately it is him 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.870
 will fail because when it burns down 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.800
 he will be very disappointed because he is there 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:42.830
 do not get in any way well here 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.580
 In short, the type burned down 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.000
 atom obsidian and you inside the same board 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.600
 you 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.750
 beautiful com well well and and and you know 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.840
 that no griffer will suit you 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.870
 In general, in any way, well, you can also 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.690
 stone or whatever you like i don't know 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.680
 boards for example birch there or else 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.500
 what do not know what kind of blocks like this 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.680
 way but he costly you understand he 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.220
 occupies three blocks so the wall 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.400
 have to 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.170
 that house three blocks it you understand 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.710
 Ostina is quite wide but it is 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.940
 reliable but also supplements beautiful but true 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.730
 will repair 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.010
 long grif I come on what 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:31.460
 The difference of griffers is not much but 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.550
 I still hope you like it and I 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.380
 I'll release soon how to protect 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.990
 protect your home but not on the server and you 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.270
 when for example with a friend playing there 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.970
 decided some battle 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:51.190
 arrange but there is no privat well or am i 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.710
 the next release will be released as 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.800
 disguise your house at all but to 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:59.920
 it griefers not found or something well, 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.250
 some combine combinations of mechanisms 

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.390
 so you can even survive without private 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.150
 okay 

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:10.830
 and goodbye dear swami friends 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.830
 was Slavik and to new meetings
