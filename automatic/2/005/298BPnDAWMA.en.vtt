00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pretty good now it wasn't the greatest

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109

thing<00:01:22.770> since<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> story<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> pretty<00:01:23.880> much

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
thing since the story is pretty much

you'd<00:01:53.520> expect<00:01:54.090> for<00:01:54.299> something<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.899> but

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you'd expect for something like this but

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.350 
you'd expect for something like this but
like<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.649> said<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.979> had<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> charm<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.060> had<00:01:57.240> an

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
like I said it had a charm it had an

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.109 
like I said it had a charm it had an
atmosphere<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:59.100> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> surprised

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
atmosphere that just kind of surprised

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
atmosphere that just kind of surprised
me<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.750> came<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> nowhere<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.219> did<00:02:02.520> not

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
me that I came out of nowhere I did not

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.510 
me that I came out of nowhere I did not
expect<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.320> why<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.890> enjoyment<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
expect it so that's why my enjoyment of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.590 
expect it so that's why my enjoyment of
this<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.939> much<00:02:06.360> higher<00:02:06.750> than<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
this was much higher than it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.630 
this was much higher than it
have<00:02:07.750> been<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.289> honestly<00:02:08.740> can't<00:02:09.069> even<00:02:09.190> say

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
have been so I honestly can't even say

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.550 
have been so I honestly can't even say
that<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.690> good<00:02:10.929> one<00:02:11.050> check<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.470> out

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
that this is a good one check it out

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.140
