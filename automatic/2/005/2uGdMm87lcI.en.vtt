 like those others that we have received 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 and has oriental pressure 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.759
 there was housing 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.749
 and your bonus is to pass all these pieces that are forming a truncheon 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.100
 do you ever have two other columns 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.490
 but you have to perfect your album 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.860
 I recognize that they have restrictions 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.110
 I can not pass 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 the amount of the track but you have to pass it to 1 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 and it always has to be 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.820
 one piece 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.980
 that little work queen 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.570
 Soho spend the Ramadan the smallest piece without another that the order is 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.790
 Both cities 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 according to the owner 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.260
 this would be little 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.910
 robocop is fascinating that they are more two or three last 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.190
 and there just as we are going to generate that the Vietnamese win 11 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.480
 the war the Americans the canon relator 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.870
 there is all kinds of material like at home 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.970
 the wine 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.400
 built by the slots factories - a rival Argentine factory 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.990
 attractive brand colors the same thing 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 if the rival 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 what remains 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.110
 although the Argentine white industry without feeling passing the day 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 policy said to her husband 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.990
 the ones so I 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.300
 federico fasano hours this is the job 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 On the other hand, parity 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.020
 absolute 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.690
 they were passive 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.480
 wife michelle opens 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 also one is moving the pieces 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.769
 theoretically that when it came out 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.379
 one less problem 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.379
 of furniture and wood

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.119
 industrial form 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.119
 unlike that town 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.509
 plastic 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.379
 sheet 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 this ordinance 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.609
 baptized which has achieved has to leave 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.109
 Fortunately 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 I found out that he took out dying little by little 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 theoretically healthy 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.099
 as he says he will abide early to plastic tipped boat 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:58.609
