buy organic feed already ground so we

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.020 
buy organic feed already ground so we
grow<00:01:58.690> our<00:01:58.840> own<00:01:59.100> every<00:02:00.100> two<00:02:00.280> years<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.640> bring<00:02:00.909> in

for the for the morning hours we have

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.200 
for the for the morning hours we have
three<00:03:08.000> year<00:03:08.510> old<00:03:08.720> heritage<00:03:09.140> chickens<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.210> ten

Americana<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.540> John<00:03:15.260> declare<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.800> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
Americana and John declare and the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.860 
Americana and John declare and the
reason<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.550> introduce<00:03:16.940> those<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.630> flock

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
reason we introduce those to the flock

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.990 
reason we introduce those to the flock
was<00:03:18.530> because<00:03:18.980> first<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.460> all<00:03:19.550> they<00:03:19.700> provide

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
was because first of all they provide

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.480 
was because first of all they provide
diversity<00:03:20.630> but<00:03:20.810> secondly<00:03:21.350> they<00:03:21.950> haven't<00:03:22.340> got

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
diversity but secondly they haven't got

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.370 
diversity but secondly they haven't got
that<00:03:22.520> brooding<00:03:23.060> instinct<00:03:23.690> bred<00:03:23.930> out<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.140> them

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
that brooding instinct bred out of them

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.170 
that brooding instinct bred out of them
like<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.709> other<00:03:24.830> dual-purpose<00:03:25.400> chicks<00:03:25.910> do

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
like the other dual-purpose chicks do

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.750 
like the other dual-purpose chicks do
that<00:03:26.390> we<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.560> hopefully<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.490> idea

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
that we have here so hopefully the idea

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.340 
that we have here so hopefully the idea
would<00:03:28.910> be<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.090> they<00:03:29.360> would<00:03:29.570> lay<00:03:29.959> eggs<00:03:30.200> that

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
would be that they would lay eggs that

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.960 
would be that they would lay eggs that
are<00:03:30.440> fertilized<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.220> then<00:03:31.400> sit<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:31.790> them

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
are fertilized and then sit on them

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.940 
are fertilized and then sit on them
until<00:03:32.330> they<00:03:32.900> hatched<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.709> we<00:03:33.830> could

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
until they hatched and then we could

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.890 
until they hatched and then we could
reproduce<00:03:34.520> our<00:03:34.910> own<00:03:35.060> flock<00:03:35.390> instead<00:03:35.810> of

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
reproduce our own flock instead of

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.840 
reproduce our own flock instead of
having<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.140> buy<00:03:36.350> day-old<00:03:37.280> chicks<00:03:37.610> all<00:03:37.820> the

having to buy day-old chicks all the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.530 
having to buy day-old chicks all the
time<00:03:42.250> future<00:03:43.250> plans<00:03:43.640> include<00:03:44.120> perhaps

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
time future plans include perhaps

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.210 
time future plans include perhaps
increasing<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.170> flock<00:03:45.410> especially<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
increasing the flock especially the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.430 
increasing the flock especially the
heritage<00:03:46.610> breeds<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.150> eventually<00:03:48.020> building

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
heritage breeds and eventually building

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.610 
heritage breeds and eventually building
a<00:03:48.620> chicken<00:03:49.100> tractor<00:03:49.610> which<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.940> moveable

the pasture or the orchards and that way

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.660 
the pasture or the orchards and that way
the<00:03:56.390> chickens<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.930> more<00:03:57.519> pastures<00:03:58.519> that

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
the chickens have more pastures that

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.090 
the chickens have more pastures that
they<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:59.000> find<00:03:59.480> food<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.410> they<00:04:00.950> also

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
they can find food in and they also

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.030 
they can find food in and they also
deposit<00:04:01.820> their<00:04:02.269> manure<00:04:02.600> which<00:04:03.290> fertilizes
