PEGI<00:00:00.989> 18<00:00:14.420> when<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> spinner<00:00:16.470> cell

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
PEGI 18 when you look at it spinner cell

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.250 
PEGI 18 when you look at it spinner cell
one<00:00:17.039> was<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> benchmark<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> came<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
one was a benchmark when it came out and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160 
one was a benchmark when it came out and
splinter<00:00:19.710> cell<00:00:19.920> 3<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.789> probably<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.840> best

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.800 
splinter cell 3 was probably the best
looking<00:00:22.500> game<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.760> last<00:00:24.029> generation<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
looking game of the last generation of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
looking game of the last generation of
consoles<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.010> extremely<00:00:26.400> important

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
consoles so it was extremely important

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.720 
consoles so it was extremely important
for<00:00:27.210> us<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> when<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:27.900> released<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.830> spinner

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
for us that when we released our spinner

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
for us that when we released our spinner
cell<00:00:29.970> conviction<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.230> came<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.619> as

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
cell conviction that it came out as

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.389 
cell conviction that it came out as
strong<00:00:33.410> we<00:00:34.410> came<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> bunch<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.219> things

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
strong we came up with a bunch of things

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
strong we came up with a bunch of things
that<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:36.030> super<00:00:36.660> interesting<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> first

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that are super interesting so the first

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
that are super interesting so the first
thing<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.059> is<00:00:39.059> what<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.420> called

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
thing that we have is what we called

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
thing that we have is what we called
Project<00:00:40.530> deck<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.980> basically<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.489> we're

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
Project deck so basically what we're

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
Project deck so basically what we're
doing<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.210> integrating<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
doing is we're integrating in the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
doing is we're integrating in the
environment<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.210> objectives<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.840> were

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
environment the objectives that were

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.069 
environment the objectives that were
giving<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> player<00:00:47.629> will<00:00:48.629> actually<00:00:48.930> be

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
giving to the player will actually be

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.540 
giving to the player will actually be
telling<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> what's<00:00:49.829> happening<00:00:49.950> or<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
telling you what's happening or the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.549 
telling you what's happening or the
information<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.149> wanted<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.660> we'll<00:00:52.410> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
information you wanted to know we'll be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
information you wanted to know we'll be
seeing<00:00:53.180> flashbacks<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.989> projected

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
seeing flashbacks where things projected

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
seeing flashbacks where things projected
on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> walls<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.370> explain<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
on the walls that will explain that so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.819 
on the walls that will explain that so
everything<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> integrated<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
everything is integrated in the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.950 
everything is integrated in the
environment<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> allows<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> tell

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
environment and it allows you to tell

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
environment and it allows you to tell
the<00:01:01.079> story<00:01:01.379> without<00:01:01.800> taking<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.820> control

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the story without taking the control

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.869 
the story without taking the control
from<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> player

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
from the player

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.999 
from the player
so<00:01:05.570> what<00:01:05.750> son<00:01:05.990> is<00:01:06.140> thinking<00:01:06.500> what's<00:01:06.649> happening

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
so what son is thinking what's happening

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.319 
so what son is thinking what's happening
somewhere<00:01:07.219> else<00:01:07.490> in<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.700> world<00:01:07.909> it's

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
somewhere else in the world it's

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.359 
somewhere else in the world it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
damaged system so the more you beat up

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.480 
damaged system so the more you beat up
the<00:01:59.750> guy<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.959> get<00:02:00.289> information<00:02:00.619> while<00:02:01.159> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the guy to get information while the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.919 
the guy to get information while the
more<00:02:01.700> he's<00:02:01.819> gonna<00:02:01.970> is<00:02:02.270> going<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.569> show<00:02:02.720> like

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
more he's gonna is going to show like

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.199 
more he's gonna is going to show like
he's<00:02:03.380> beaten<00:02:03.679> up<00:02:06.069> it<00:02:07.069> gets<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.489> little<00:02:07.700> violent

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.860 
he's beaten up it gets a little violent
but<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:09.019> gets<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.319> job<00:02:09.410> done<00:02:10.540> we<00:02:11.540> wanted<00:02:11.840> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
but it gets the job done we wanted to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.509 
but it gets the job done we wanted to
have<00:02:12.079> a<00:02:12.140> unity<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.709> time<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.220> location

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
have a unity of time and location

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.400 
have a unity of time and location
because<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.239> find<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.959> makes<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.290> all

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
because we find that that makes it all

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.229 
because we find that that makes it all
more<00:02:15.470> personal<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.100> players<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:16.940> more

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
more personal for players it's more

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.970 
more personal for players it's more
interesting<00:02:17.569> story<00:02:17.989> wise<00:02:18.200> because<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
interesting story wise because the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.520 
interesting story wise because the
events<00:02:19.430> are<00:02:19.549> unfolding<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.450> lot<00:02:20.630> faster<00:02:21.170> so

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
events are unfolding a lot faster so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.069 
events are unfolding a lot faster so
Washington<00:02:22.069> was<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.280> very<00:02:22.639> interesting

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
Washington was a very interesting

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.780 
Washington was a very interesting
location<00:02:24.079> for<00:02:24.319> us<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:24.920> it's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
location for us because obviously it's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.900 
location for us because obviously it's
the<00:02:26.060> heart<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.350> United<00:02:27.739> States<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.700> also

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
we took a lot of risk when we approached

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.440 
we took a lot of risk when we approached
the<00:02:45.920> design<00:02:46.340> for<00:02:46.579> this<00:02:46.670> we<00:02:46.850> came<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.150> with<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the design for this we came up with a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.050 
the design for this we came up with a
whole<00:02:47.780> bunch<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.769> new<00:02:49.010> design<00:02:49.459> elements<00:02:49.940> that

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
whole bunch of new design elements that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.059 
whole bunch of new design elements that
have<00:02:50.239> never<00:02:50.510> been<00:02:50.750> done<00:02:50.989> before<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:51.709> any<00:02:51.889> other

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
game and the day that all those elements

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.640 
game and the day that all those elements
came<00:02:55.100> together<00:02:55.280> was<00:02:55.670> fascinating<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.650> finally

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
came together was fascinating it finally
