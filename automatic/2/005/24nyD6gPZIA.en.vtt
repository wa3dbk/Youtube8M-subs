00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
around for stuff it just seemed to be a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.039 
around for stuff it just seemed to be a
good<00:01:49.149> size<00:01:49.419> to<00:01:49.869> put<00:01:50.319> candy<00:01:51.069> on<00:01:51.419> like<00:01:52.419> that<00:01:52.719> so<00:01:53.020> I

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
good size to put candy on like that so I

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649 
good size to put candy on like that so I
can<00:01:53.409> dissect<00:01:54.159> it<00:01:54.849> without<00:01:55.119> doing<00:01:55.419> it<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.630> my

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
can dissect it without doing it on my

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.039 
can dissect it without doing it on my
table<00:01:56.619> top<00:01:56.979> so<00:01:57.340> less<00:01:57.999> cleaning<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:58.689> table

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
table top so less cleaning of the table

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.069 
table top so less cleaning of the table
top<00:01:59.259> says<00:01:59.919> KitKat<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.669> top<00:02:00.999> now<00:02:01.659> it's<00:02:01.779> a<00:02:01.869> little

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
warm I had it in a place where it was

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.279 
warm I had it in a place where it was
cool<00:02:03.849> it<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.389> not<00:02:04.569> in<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.810> refrigerator<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
cool it was not in the refrigerator and

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.910 
cool it was not in the refrigerator and
let's<00:02:08.289> let's<00:02:08.950> dissect<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:11.590> we<00:02:11.709> go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.800 

okay<00:02:14.920> let's<00:02:15.550> just<00:02:15.730> cut<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:16.090> three<00:02:16.420> sections

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
okay let's just cut all three sections

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.970 
okay let's just cut all three sections
here<00:02:17.459> two<00:02:18.459> cuts<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.629> then<00:02:20.379> maybe<00:02:20.530> we'll<00:02:20.709> break

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
here two cuts and then maybe we'll break

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.300 
here two cuts and then maybe we'll break
a<00:02:21.010> layer<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.360> looks<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.099> layer

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
a layer so it looks like see the layer

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.759 
a layer so it looks like see the layer
on<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.790> top<00:02:27.819> here<00:02:29.549> three<00:02:30.549> layers<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.879> crisp

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
on the top here three layers of crisp

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.839 
on the top here three layers of crisp
two<00:02:32.769> layers<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.040> chocolate<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> layer<00:02:33.819> of

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
two layers of chocolate and a layer of

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.820 
two layers of chocolate and a layer of
peanut<00:02:34.390> butter<00:02:34.530> which<00:02:35.530> looks<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.099> right<00:02:36.340> on

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
peanut butter which looks to be right on

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.100 
peanut butter which looks to be right on
now<00:02:38.830> let's<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:39.220> we<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.870> break<00:02:40.870> one

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
now let's see if we can break one

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.259 
now let's see if we can break one
