00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
highly inspired by the by the BAM system

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.410 
highly inspired by the by the BAM system
that<00:02:42.359> we<00:02:42.569> use<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:44.010> Assassin's<00:02:44.579> Creed<00:02:44.670> 2

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.170 
that we use for the Assassin's Creed 2
game<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:47.239> basically<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.599> cooking<00:02:49.260> mission

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
game so basically it's cooking mission

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.309 
game so basically it's cooking mission
each<00:02:51.180> mission<00:02:51.569> has<00:02:51.780> three<00:02:52.500> steps<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:54.109> for<00:02:55.109> each

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
each mission has three steps so for each

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.610 
each mission has three steps so for each
step<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.489> assign<00:02:56.849> up<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.629> four<00:02:57.930> assassin

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
step you can assign up to four assassin

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.199 
step you can assign up to four assassin
each<00:02:59.280> assassin<00:02:59.970> has<00:03:00.239> -<00:03:00.829> has<00:03:01.829> helped<00:03:02.430> also<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
each assassin has - has helped also and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.319 
each assassin has - has helped also and
each<00:03:03.930> mission<00:03:04.290> has<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.030> requirements<00:03:06.030> killed

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
each mission has the requirements killed

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.720 
each mission has the requirements killed
so<00:03:06.900> for<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.439> mission<00:03:07.859> I<00:03:07.950> need<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.430> lot<00:03:08.700> of

for the mission graduation so this is
the<00:05:01.030> player<00:05:01.270> position<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.530> where<00:05:02.860> they<00:05:03.070> go

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
the player position so where they go

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.380 
the player position so where they go
during<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:04.690> mission<00:05:05.130> we<00:05:06.130> can<00:05:06.310> toggle<00:05:06.550> between

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
during the mission we can toggle between

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.660 
during the mission we can toggle between
different<00:05:07.660> type<00:05:08.500> of<00:05:08.530> layers<00:05:08.920> so<00:05:09.340> we<00:05:09.490> have

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
different type of layers so we have

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.210 
different type of layers so we have
position<00:05:10.360> where<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.900> conflicts<00:05:11.350> start<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
position where the conflicts start the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.050 
position where the conflicts start the
synchronization<00:05:12.930> kills<00:05:13.930> grid<00:05:14.830> point<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.760> each

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
synchronization kills grid point so each

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.920 
synchronization kills grid point so each
time<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.690> select<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.320> new<00:05:17.620> layer<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.310> it<00:05:18.550> map

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
time you select a new layer the it map

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.520 
time you select a new layer the it map
refresh<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:21.370> get<00:05:21.550> new<00:05:21.850> data

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
refresh and you get new data

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.770 
refresh and you get new data
visualization<00:05:23.530> on<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.370> on<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.850> other

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780
