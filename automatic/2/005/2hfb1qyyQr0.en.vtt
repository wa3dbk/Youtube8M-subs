00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.049
 I am also today it is Monday and I played 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.940
 cooking video and today I'm going to make 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.000
 these cakes that are for occasions 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.160
 super special I bought this sense and 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
 the truth when I saw it I was enlightened 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.880
 eyes because I have long wanted 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.740
 make this cake that is chocolate 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 provided in the form of biscuit orio 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.320
 giant and it's like really since I 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.390
 I made one light up my eyes and I could not 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.640
 resist so let's do this 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.290
 beautiful cake and see how it is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.060
 remember that all the ingredients 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.340
 they're down here in the little box 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.690
 information and on my facebook so and so and 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 if they do not have the mold they can 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.039
 get online or you can use two 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.570
 molds for pie and make it as if 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.190
 outside a cookie the details 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.120
 they can do confuse so there's no 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 excuse for our 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.360
 and today I 'm not going to start with the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.860
 cake today I'll start with 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.170
 the filling because I want it to be fine 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.540
 firm for when you go at the time of 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.550
 assemble everything and we will use cream to 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.050
 beat this is the cream to beat that 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.670
 I always use it because I already know that they are going to 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.759
 ask in the comments 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.040
 written to beat the lincoln brand 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.080
 always always use this has no sugar 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.050
 to fit so we have to put 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.170
 sugar so let's add sugar 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.570
 day and let's start to beat little to 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.190
 little until your profile is and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.170
 remember that for the cream to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.729
 beat monte super well they have to be 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.710
 well really cold in fact this was a 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.659
 little time in the freezer 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.659
 and now we are going to start assembling it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 and now yes since the sugar is 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.270
 fully incorporated I'm going to put this 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.909
 at very high speed about two minutes 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.729
 when we form soft peaks like this 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.310
 is already ready and what we are going to do is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 that we're going to integrate oreo cookies 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 I left the filling to contribute that 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.159
 taste and so you know that it 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.470
 conquer cream or the truth is that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.040
 you have to leave the creampie so that it 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 note is in large pieces so that it 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.850
 feel at the time of savoring 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.800
 and I know that maybe it's already too much but 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.690
 if you are as sweet as me 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.840
 they will not resist and I'm going to 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.970
 add sneakers in squares 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.640
 now I have a little bit of grenetina that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.530
 is already hydrated put 10 seconds 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.010
 the microwave and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.189
 temper it with this same cream 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.079
 to be able to integrate it into the mix and this 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.939
 is to give it stability and that when 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.030
 take it out of the refrigerator or freezer 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.680
 do not start to melt 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 and now we are going to integrate this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.299
 all the grenetine 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.970
 and make little surrounding movements 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.459
 a little bit here I have a mold for 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.500
 cake lined with plastic with plastic 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.659
 of kitchen that is the same size as 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.730
 sponge cake that I'm going to do ok try to make 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.150
 be the same size or a little bit more 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.819
 little one and what we're going to do is put 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.480
 our mix 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.959
 in this mold and we will extend it very 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.170
 very well that it is very uniform in 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.390
 our mold 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.069
 and what we're going to do is put this to 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.520
 freezer is what we do our 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.520
 Biscuit 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.879
 well and now we're going to start with the 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.920
 sponge cake remember that the first thing that is 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.470
 financial 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.090
 is to preheat the oven usually to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.849
 180 degrees 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.390
 let's start mixing the oil with 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.390
 the sugar 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.890
 then we are going to add an egg 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.550
 we let it integrate and add the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.550
 second egg 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.250
 now I'm going to integrate the powders that are 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.180
 the flour the royal and the cocoa little to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.180
 little following 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.739
 immediately after the powder 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.739
 we must add milk and vanilla 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.350
 and do not forget to scratch the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.920
 shores to incorporate everything that is 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.830
 it's stuck there 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.260
 and at the end we will add hot water 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.240
 This mixture is very tasty but it is 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.470
 because the cocoa dries the pies a lot 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.280
 why sometimes the cakes of 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.560
 chocolate are somewhat dry because the cocoa 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.090
 dries the cake a lot so if 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.040
 we integrate hot water that's going to 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.700
 keep the moisture in the cake and going to 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.080
 stay soft and delicious and moisturized well 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.580
 Do not worry about mixing 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 very very watery like this is 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.289
 here I have my mold on a tray 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.780
 for oven and the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.490
 empty the mix my mold is of 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.409
 silicones and you do not need like 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.840
 greased and floured but if the 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.689
 you are conventional remember that 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.120
 step so they can unmold it and 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.889
 let's take them to the oven 180 degrees 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.889
 35 to 40 minutes 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.389
 before unmolding the biscuits 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.280
 make sure they are already well 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.939
 Cool so they can be unmoulded 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.939
 no problem 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.110
 and now it is time to assemble our 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.340
 cake let's put our first 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.340
 sponge cake down 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.490
 and remember that we had this as 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.170
 plastic our cream our filling 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.320
 Well, we're just going to remove it 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:58.080
 of the mold 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.979
 remove the plastic ready 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.979
 we put it 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:07.549
 and we finish with our other layer of 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.549
 Biscuit 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.860
