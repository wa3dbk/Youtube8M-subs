00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the fluid is changed for two reasons

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.290 
the fluid is changed for two reasons
first<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.590> pan<00:01:38.830> has<00:01:39.100> no<00:01:39.369> drain<00:01:39.729> plug<00:01:40.000> so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
first the pan has no drain plug so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.029 
first the pan has no drain plug so
dropping<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.810> pan<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.289> best<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.740> get

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
dropping the pan is the best way to get

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.430 
dropping the pan is the best way to get
the<00:01:42.159> fluid<00:01:42.490> out<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.940> secondly<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.110> only<00:01:44.320> way

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
the fluid out and secondly the only way

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440 
the fluid out and secondly the only way
to<00:01:44.500> access<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.130> filter<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.640> by<00:01:45.819> removing<00:01:46.149> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
to access the filter is by removing the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.109 
to access the filter is by removing the
pan<00:01:46.890> around<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.069> perimeter<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.909> pan

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
pan around the perimeter of the pan

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.230 
pan around the perimeter of the pan

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
there are a total of fourteen ten

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.420 
there are a total of fourteen ten
millimeter<00:01:52.780> bolts<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.530> hold<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.009> pan<00:01:54.250> in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
millimeter bolts that hold the pan in

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.170 
millimeter bolts that hold the pan in
place<00:01:54.810> plus<00:01:55.810> there's<00:01:56.350> one<00:01:56.799> ten<00:01:57.670> millimeter

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.690 
place plus there's one ten millimeter
nut<00:01:58.540> right<00:01:58.960> there<00:01:59.229> that<00:02:00.159> holds<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.549> little

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
nut right there that holds a little

nut right there that holds a little
bracket<00:02:01.000> onto<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.600> pan<00:02:01.840> you'll<00:02:02.799> need<00:02:02.979> to

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
bracket onto the pan you'll need to

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.709 
bracket onto the pan you'll need to
remove<00:02:03.280> all<00:02:03.460> these<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.939> order<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.270> get<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.509> pan

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
remove all these in order to get the pan

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.200 
remove all these in order to get the pan
to<00:02:04.899> drop

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.120 

removing<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.360> bolts<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:08.810> pretty<00:02:09.080> simple<00:02:09.380> but

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
removing the bolts is pretty simple but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.620 
removing the bolts is pretty simple but
you<00:02:10.250> might<00:02:10.430> want<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.670> keep<00:02:10.820> in<00:02:11.000> mind<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.420> it's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
you might want to keep in mind that it's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.990 
you might want to keep in mind that it's
probably<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.020> good<00:02:12.200> idea<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.590> leave<00:02:12.950> at<00:02:13.520> least

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
probably a good idea to leave at least

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.750 
probably a good idea to leave at least
the<00:02:14.510> four<00:02:14.780> corner<00:02:15.290> bolts<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.860> until<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> very

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the four corner bolts in until the very

can lay the gasket out over the pan as

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.589 
can lay the gasket out over the pan as

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.649 
in order to get all the bolts torqued
evenly<00:05:38.280> you'll<00:05:38.939> need<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.240> work<00:05:39.419> out<00:05:39.629> a

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
evenly you'll need to work out a

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.390 
evenly you'll need to work out a
sequence<00:05:40.169> where<00:05:40.379> you<00:05:40.439> start<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:40.949> one<00:05:41.159> side<00:05:41.370> of

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
sequence where you start on one side of

sequence where you start on one side of
the<00:05:41.550> pan<00:05:41.789> torque<00:05:42.539> it<00:05:42.689> there<00:05:42.960> then<00:05:43.289> switch<00:05:43.620> over

the pan torque it there then switch over

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.770 
the pan torque it there then switch over
to<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.099> other<00:05:44.219> side<00:05:44.580> of<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.789> pan<00:05:45.030> torque<00:05:45.659> a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
to the other side of the pan torque a

to the other side of the pan torque a
bolt<00:05:45.960> there<00:05:46.229> then<00:05:46.770> switch<00:05:47.069> back<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:47.550> first

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
bolt there then switch back to the first

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.300 
bolt there then switch back to the first
side<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.389> keep<00:05:48.870> alternating<00:05:49.139> around<00:05:49.979> until

you get all the way around the pan

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.830 
you get all the way around the pan
then<00:05:54.250> increase<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.060> torque<00:05:55.270> on<00:05:55.480> the<00:05:55.600> wrench

used<00:06:24.810> about<00:06:24.960> one<00:06:25.350> gallon<00:06:25.590> of<00:06:25.919> fluid<00:06:26.310> and

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
used about one gallon of fluid and

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.850 
used about one gallon of fluid and
therefore<00:06:27.300> need<00:06:27.780> to<00:06:27.810> replace<00:06:28.289> about<00:06:28.650> one

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
therefore need to replace about one

gallon of fluid pull the dipstick and

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.590 
gallon of fluid pull the dipstick and
insert<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.800> funnel<00:06:32.190> then<00:06:32.669> pour<00:06:33.060> in<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.240> four

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
insert a funnel then pour in the four

quarts of fluid I figure I actually lost

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.719 
quarts of fluid I figure I actually lost
a<00:06:36.780> little<00:06:37.020> bit<00:06:37.169> to<00:06:37.350> spillage<00:06:37.860> and<00:06:38.070> so<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.250> added

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
a little bit to spillage and so I added

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.090 
a little bit to spillage and so I added
in<00:06:38.880> a<00:06:38.970> little<00:06:39.120> bit<00:06:39.330> more<00:06:39.539> on<00:06:39.690> top<00:06:39.720> of<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.259> with
