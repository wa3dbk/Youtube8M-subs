00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.980
 we can talk about him about his storm was sent 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.529
 basically housing 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.820
 and a sector of being confined i are going now what is very very important 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.869
 and that decides 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.230
 very complex teeth and karim very dangerous also for 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.380
 pj the city to the fire sector or lifeguards or firemen 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.080
 p 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.080
 smoke pretense jova cracks that is called 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.710
 per hundred is something that I believe in mind 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.270
 for us it is very important because it is not easy to determine when it is going to 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.120
 occur 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 that kind of statements and the fire 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.870
 Generally a fire is divided into three stages 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.430
 the first stage that is from the part of the world started 24 years old or fire 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.040
 per cent the second stage which is the part of the free conduit or combustion 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.840
 complete 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.090
 already two stages of part d 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.980
 oletta father to burn if he calls that is called in 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.890
 our biography 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.130
 in the first stage as 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.310
 motorcycle or as its name indicates is when combustion begins 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.520
 I do not feel anything and finally a good amount of oxygen the environment 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 begins to expand smoke 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.570
 p12 But the oxygen is all full and credit or makes the flames 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 in fact driving but it has not been completed st 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 we do not have any big smoke production and he 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.860
 the fire we were going this 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 be developed with total freedom 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.680
 moment of the arrival of firefighters to the city of firefighters we are 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.770
 usually with the stage 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.390
 of complete combustion by stages of burning 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.600
 if you call it is a stage of slow combustion and in the most dangerous 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 let's consider that in a room like a normal 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.840
 of any housing with solid fuel common class a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.330
 p from the beginning of the fire in the beginning the fire 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.860
 until generalized in its entirety 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 the statement in its entirety 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.509
 it's three minutes 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.579
 nothing else 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.559
 and this but this time he regretted that in two and a half minutes 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:17.369
 chalá the room a situation we are talking about 10 normal measures 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.849
 conventional 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.409
 in two and a half minutes it takes fire all 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.679
 the whole room 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.869
 and that may allow your goal is to consider 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.309
 three minutes 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.680
 maximum for a room 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.280
 with common materials 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.759
 A class 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.509
 fire in its entirety 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:42.019
 but it means that once the economy has unimportant within 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.839
 the room 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.519
 today begins 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.809
 finish the oxygen 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.249
 or the air inside 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 those of the enclosure in playa del carmen was sold 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.029
 therefore combustion company xavi min flee 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.829
 Delivers the two weeks to Messi 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.510
 but the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.189
 Heat intensity and incandescence euros 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.709
 nor materials 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.679
 who are buying is still intact to say that we are talking about 700 degrees 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.439
 centigrade more or less at that stage in the free combustion stage we have 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.989
 750 800 degrees Celsius 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.899
 inside a room 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:22.929
 the chin sector fire when we enter the third stage that the fire 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.929
 22 to reduce the lovers to shrink 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:32.079
 they lowered me 1 little the temperature has lasted but the incandescence yes and 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.079
 the temperature in short following 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.879
 level of um 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.709
 begins to descend 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.539
 in the burning stage 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.889
 he left many free 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.139
 behind room to give and passion take the walk 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.750
 in the agm the fringe saving in the range of smoke that is doing pressure 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.299
 out 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.989
 i the lower part we have some depression or a one or insufflation of 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:02.650
 air that 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.690
 it is taken from 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.870
 the class openings that 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.549
 the smoke is known but once the flame starts before the product shrinks 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.749
 that the deceased is ending 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.679
 there is more grape production or because it is so much about incomplete combustion 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:18.569
 increased production of carbon monoxide 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.530
 and other types of gases that make 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.590
 the situation is very toxic and also a lot of volume, congratulate this 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.210
 makes the humor in spite of descending ascend to descend 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.159
 and starts to come out below even from the 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.159
 at the height of the door of the headquarters of the Italian company 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.879
 then it is a mario instinct we have to visualize 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.189
 who are working to put out the fire who is in the place 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.389
 which is a very dangerous stage when we see that the smoke comes out in spurts 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.490
 out in a grayish tone I swear 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.180
 ride 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.430
 the below line c vegetables 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.430
 On the one hand let's say that the height is quite low 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.879
 this is not a dangerous situation that means 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.770
 that we are very soon to an explosion of smoke and the explosion of a graf bomb 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.710
 how are they going to read 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.569
 in many estudillo grafías 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.599
 3 percent twenty 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.459
 ellen dangerous and irreversible to the person who finds the place if 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:14.229
 this follows 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.240
 produces 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.630
 then the only area that we have to defend our knowledge is visualize 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.830
 know how to identify why we ask people when they find a sector 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.080
 or fire try to understand try to know 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.360
 that a smoke explosion is likely 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.479
 remember that the smoke 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.319
 the interned material 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.760
 by type of fuel finally divided with large 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.360
 probability of burning 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.699
 suddenly 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.699
 this means that if we are talking about juna he drove grips to sweep 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.509
 sudden way in a confined space in a step to the side 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.009
 that is simply 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.009
 synonymous with an explosion 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.180
 p in the aesthetic fireman has claimed many lives 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.619
 and therefore sd 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.599
 cd of our trainings 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.319
 There is not much emphasis on knowing what you think of identifying it 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.550
 short plumber working works with 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.710
 mcafee is a no diffuse h that the temperature can not agree 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.910
 I also had him 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.270
 we also work with autonomous equipment that we can not touch 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.270
 through our no nostrils 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:26.309
 and this causes that but we can not perceive perfectly in what state 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.459
 find the fire but I know that it is very important to preview 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.189
 and take charge in the absence of the Alazanas charge of the situation 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.039
 berthevin that moment we are 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.550
 we just wanted to reflect that situation that unlikely is very 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.309
 likely to be all 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.610
 also like us 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.980
 know how to identify the fire sector when 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.020
 30 in conditions is very likely to an explosion of smoke or baghdad 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.819
 remember that a room 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.680
 the normal thing to mention 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.380
 It takes three minutes from the beginning of the fire start the first 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.020
 half to work 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.779
 until they are generated is generalized 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:07.639
 the minute 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.639
 in a very short time as little time to give help 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.440
 so we ask a lot of care when they have to against psoe not 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.080
 situation of these characteristics very many thanks
