whole<00:01:48.170> fully<00:01:49.170> upside<00:01:49.680> down<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.340> gives<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
whole fully upside down which gives me a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
whole fully upside down which gives me a
big<00:01:52.110> buoy<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> front

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.160 

if<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.189> is<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.759> normal<00:02:01.210> police<00:02:01.420> very<00:02:01.810> small

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
if this is the normal police very small

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.580 
if this is the normal police very small
and<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.270> mower<00:02:04.600> deck<00:02:04.750> believe<00:02:05.380> which

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
and this is the mower deck believe which

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.789 
and this is the mower deck believe which
comes<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:07.000> engine<00:02:07.479> which<00:02:07.899> is<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:08.440> lot

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
comes out of the engine which is a lot

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.400 
comes out of the engine which is a lot
bigger<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.709> what<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:13.720> much<00:02:13.959> going<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
bigger so what I'm pretty much going to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.520 
bigger so what I'm pretty much going to
do<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.910> I'm<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.450> put<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.989> upside<00:02:17.440> down

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
do is I'm going to put it upside down

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.009 
do is I'm going to put it upside down
like<00:02:18.069> this<00:02:19.739> which<00:02:20.739> gives<00:02:21.069> me<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:22.450> bigger

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
like this which gives me this bigger

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.320 
like this which gives me this bigger
pulley<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:27.010> course<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.489> new<00:02:27.730> fee<00:02:28.060> belt

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
