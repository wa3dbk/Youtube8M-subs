together yet huh now one thing about
these<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.630> they're<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.170> top-heavy<00:01:25.740> some

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
these is they're really top-heavy some

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.560 
these is they're really top-heavy some
of<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.580> Captain<00:01:27.030> American<00:01:27.390> ones

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
of these like Captain American ones

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
of these like Captain American ones
Captain<00:01:28.140> America<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:28.710> stands<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.189> pretty

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Captain America one stands up pretty

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.069 
Captain America one stands up pretty
good<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.850> you'll<00:01:30.150> notice<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> spider<00:01:30.869> buy

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
good but you'll notice the spider buy

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.380 
good but you'll notice the spider buy
expire<00:01:31.409> Man<00:01:31.590> 1<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.040> almost<00:01:32.759> impossible<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
expire Man 1 it's almost impossible to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
expire Man 1 it's almost impossible to
keep<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.689> standing<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.130> feet<00:01:35.400> are

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
keep them standing because the feet are

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.719 
keep them standing because the feet are
so<00:01:35.790> small<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.659> heads<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.290> obviously

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
so small and the heads are obviously

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
so small and the heads are obviously
oversized<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> there's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> weight

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
oversized so there's a lot of weight

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.580 
oversized so there's a lot of weight
here<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> wish<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.689> toy<00:01:42.990> company<00:01:43.409> had

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
here so I wish that the toy company had

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
here so I wish that the toy company had
worked<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.549> maybe<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.240> bigger

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
worked to put maybe a little bit bigger

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.800 
worked to put maybe a little bit bigger
feet<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> give<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.680> platforms<00:01:47.810> with

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
feet or to give them all platforms with

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
feet or to give them all platforms with
the<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.600> Marvel<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.110> grab<00:01:52.320> zags<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:53.549> get

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the the Marvel will grab zags they get

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
the the Marvel will grab zags they get
these<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.479> platforms<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.409> stick

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
these little platforms you can stick

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.810 
these little platforms you can stick
them<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.460> been<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.700> of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
them on so that would have been kind of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
them on so that would have been kind of
cool<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> erasers<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.110> had<00:01:58.200> had

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
cool for the erasers if they had had

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
cool for the erasers if they had had
something<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> stand<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.479> because

stand up some of them don't
and<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.660> one<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.080> one<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.470> kind<00:02:12.860> of

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and this one is one that just kind of

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.950 
and this one is one that just kind of
just<00:02:13.280> won't<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.450> that's<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.780> only

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
just won't do it so if that's the only

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.640 
just won't do it so if that's the only
kind<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.410> downfall<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:17.140> these<00:02:18.140> characters

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
kind of downfall of these characters

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.920 
kind of downfall of these characters
some<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.580> them<00:02:19.670> staying<00:02:19.910> some<00:02:20.210> don't<00:02:20.630> and

some of them staying some don't and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.720 
some of them staying some don't and
maybe<00:02:21.500> they're<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.800> different<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.670> that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
maybe they're all different in that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.420 
maybe they're all different in that
respect<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.900> depends<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.470> team<00:02:24.800> but

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
respect it just depends on the team but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.800

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.670 

not<00:03:56.550> certain<00:03:57.000> that's<00:03:57.330> in<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.720> right<00:03:57.990> let's

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
not certain that's in the right let's

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.970 
not certain that's in the right let's
try<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:58.920> one<00:04:00.350> there<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.500> go

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
try this one there we go

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.650 
try this one there we go
I<00:04:02.010> think<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:03.530> correct<00:04:05.300> alright<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:06.630> I

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
I think this is correct alright so I

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.110 
I think this is correct alright so I
push<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.080> little<00:04:07.520> piece<00:04:08.520> through<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.000> now

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
push that little piece through so now

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.580 
push that little piece through so now
we've<00:04:09.330> got<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.630> eye<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:11.390> then<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:13.410> this

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
we've got the eye and then like this

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.070 
we've got the eye and then like this
little<00:04:13.860> peg<00:04:14.220> I'll<00:04:14.970> push<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.390> down<00:04:16.340> hopefully

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
little peg I'll push that down hopefully

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:28.010 
little peg I'll push that down hopefully
into<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.200> little<00:04:19.470> socket<00:04:19.890> here<00:04:26.450> not<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
into the little socket here not the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:39.290 
into the little socket here not the
easiest<00:04:29.660> let's<00:04:30.660> see<00:04:36.890> mm<00:04:37.890> maybe<00:04:38.640> that's<00:04:38.910> not<00:04:39.120> in

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
easiest let's see mm maybe that's not in

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.850 
easiest let's see mm maybe that's not in
the<00:04:39.390> right<00:04:39.510> way<00:04:39.630> let's<00:04:39.840> flip<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.500> try<00:04:40.800> it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
the right way let's flip it and try it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.960 
the right way let's flip it and try it
in<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.460> eye

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
