00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
and they reminded me of fresh prints or
just<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> 90s<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.790> general<00:00:39.120> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.570> a

just the 90s in general kind of like a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
just the 90s in general kind of like a
DJ<00:00:40.410> Jazzy<00:00:40.829> Jeff<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.670> whatever<00:00:41.940> his<00:00:42.090> name<00:00:42.120> was

DJ Jazzy Jeff or whatever his name was

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.180 
DJ Jazzy Jeff or whatever his name was
type<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> feel<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.620> thought<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.129> super

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
type of feel so I thought it was super

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
type of feel so I thought it was super
cool<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.910> had<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> lot<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> potential<00:00:45.960> so

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cool and a had a lot of potential so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.700 
cool and a had a lot of potential so
let's<00:00:46.739> hop<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
let's hop right into the video so the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
let's hop right into the video so the
first<00:00:49.890> thing<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.160> did<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.489> cut<00:00:50.789> both<00:00:51.030> sleeves

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
first thing I did was cut both sleeves

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.819 
first thing I did was cut both sleeves
off<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.050> knew<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> wanted<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
off because I knew that I wanted to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
off because I knew that I wanted to
change<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.850> neckline<00:01:01.609> then<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.820> tried<00:01:03.270> on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
change up the neckline then I tried on

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
change up the neckline then I tried on
the<00:01:03.570> shirt<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> determined<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.769> wanted

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the shirt and I determined that I wanted

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
the shirt and I determined that I wanted
to<00:01:05.250> cut<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.810> above<00:01:07.020> my

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to cut it about a little bit above my

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.100 
to cut it about a little bit above my
belly<00:01:07.380> button

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.859 

then<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.140> used<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.860> tank<00:01:19.190> top<00:01:19.430> as<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.450> rough

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
then I used a tank top as a really rough

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.320 
then I used a tank top as a really rough
reference<00:01:21.350> on<00:01:21.530> how<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.890> take<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:22.400> my<00:01:22.610> sides<00:01:23.000> I'm

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
reference on how to take in my sides I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.420 
reference on how to take in my sides I'm
only<00:01:23.900> worried<00:01:24.380> about<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.830> sides<00:01:25.100> because

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
only worried about the sides because

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.999 
only worried about the sides because
again<00:01:25.970> I'm<00:01:26.150> going<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.630> change<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.500> neckline

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
again I'm going to change the neckline

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.969 
again I'm going to change the neckline
so<00:01:28.790> I<00:01:28.820> pinned<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.570> sides<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.380> tank<00:01:30.530> top<00:01:30.799> on

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
so I pinned the sides of the tank top on

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.100 
so I pinned the sides of the tank top on
to<00:01:31.430> my<00:01:31.729> new<00:01:32.479> shirt

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
to my new shirt

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.710 
to my new shirt
then<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.470> tried<00:01:33.830> it<00:01:33.860> on<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.520> made<00:01:34.880> any<00:01:35.119> further

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
then I tried it on and made any further

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.960 
then I tried it on and made any further
adjustments<00:01:36.409> on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.740> pinning<00:01:37.100> based<00:01:37.399> on<00:01:37.670> my

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
adjustments on the pinning based on my

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:48.550 
adjustments on the pinning based on my
body<00:01:38.180> size<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.810> make<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.110> nice<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.380> snug<00:01:47.560> after

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
body size to make it nice and snug after

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.469 
body size to make it nice and snug after
that<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.039> stitched<00:01:49.640> my<00:01:49.970> new<00:01:50.179> sides

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
that I just stitched my new sides

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.630 
that I just stitched my new sides
together<00:01:50.750> I'm<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:51.470> using<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.920> basic<00:01:52.160> straight

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
together I'm just using a basic straight

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.969 
together I'm just using a basic straight
stitch<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.119> then<00:01:53.750> after<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.320> was<00:01:54.530> done<00:01:54.740> I

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
stitch and then after that was done I

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:12.350 
stitch and then after that was done I
just<00:01:55.280> cut<00:01:55.520> away<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.909> excess

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.390 

then<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.599> drew<00:02:13.930> two<00:02:14.230> diagonal<00:02:14.770> lines<00:02:15.040> going

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
then I drew two diagonal lines going

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.120 
then I drew two diagonal lines going
from<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:15.910> new<00:02:16.120> armpits<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.349> top<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
from my new armpits to the top of the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.589 
from my new armpits to the top of the
shoulder<00:02:18.550> where<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.849> shoulder<00:02:19.180> meets<00:02:19.209> the

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
shoulder where the shoulder meets the

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.500 
shoulder where the shoulder meets the
collar<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.170> don't<00:02:20.920> be<00:02:21.069> like<00:02:21.280> me<00:02:21.510> actually

through<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.360> make<00:02:31.660> sure<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.959> fold<00:02:32.230> up<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
through it make sure you fold up the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.309 
through it make sure you fold up the
collar<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.130> go<00:02:33.580> around<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.510> bottom<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
collar and go around the bottom of the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.150 
collar and go around the bottom of the
collar<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:43.630> did<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.019> very<00:02:44.260> basic<00:02:44.680> hem

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
collar then I just did a very basic hem

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.330 
collar then I just did a very basic hem
on<00:02:45.370> my<00:02:45.700> new<00:02:45.970> armholes<00:02:46.720> slash<00:02:47.319> neckline<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
on my new armholes slash neckline and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.120 
on my new armholes slash neckline and
again<00:02:48.880> I'm<00:02:49.120> using<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.690> very<00:02:50.380> very<00:02:50.890> basic

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
again I'm using a very very basic

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:04.080 
again I'm using a very very basic
straight<00:02:51.670> stitch<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.549> peplum<00:03:03.910> you'll

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
straight stitch for the peplum you'll

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.670 
straight stitch for the peplum you'll
need<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.390> measure<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.840> circumference<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
need to measure the circumference of the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.410 
need to measure the circumference of the
bottom<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.069> your<00:03:06.190> shirt<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:07.000> measure<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
bottom of your shirt so measure the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.479 
bottom of your shirt so measure the
bottom<00:03:07.750> laying<00:03:07.959> flat<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.560> multiply<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.430> by

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
bottom laying flat and multiply that by

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:09.870 
bottom laying flat and multiply that by
2

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
2

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880 
2
that's<00:03:10.269> your<00:03:10.420> circumference<00:03:10.900> then<00:03:11.500> take<00:03:11.709> that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
that's your circumference then take that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.180 
that's your circumference then take that
number<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.310> divide<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.880> by<00:03:13.290> 6.3<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.890> number

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
number and divide it by 6.3 that number

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.370 
number and divide it by 6.3 that number
is<00:03:15.310> going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.579> be<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.000> inner<00:03:16.359> circle<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.959> our

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
is going to be the inner circle of our

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.380 
is going to be the inner circle of our
peplum<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.310> take<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.579> bottom<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:18.970> your<00:03:19.120> shirt

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
peplum so take the bottom of your shirt

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.380 
peplum so take the bottom of your shirt
fold<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.410> half<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.980> we're<00:03:21.489> going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.910> work

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
fold it in half and we're going to work

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.800 
fold it in half and we're going to work
with<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.989> top<00:03:23.650> folded<00:03:24.519> corner<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.510> bottom

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
with the top folded corner of the bottom

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.690 
with the top folded corner of the bottom
of<00:03:25.959> our<00:03:26.170> shirt<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.070> kind<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.430> gonna<00:03:27.579> be

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
of our shirt and it's kind of gonna be

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.180 
of our shirt and it's kind of gonna be
like<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.570> circle<00:03:28.959> skirt<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.320> we<00:03:29.470> did<00:03:29.680> you're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
like the circle skirt that we did you're

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.949 
like the circle skirt that we did you're
gonna<00:03:30.250> work<00:03:30.459> with<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.700> top<00:03:30.880> corner<00:03:31.299> take<00:03:31.810> your

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
gonna work with the top corner take your

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.140 
gonna work with the top corner take your
tape<00:03:32.140> measure<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.769> draw<00:03:33.400> out<00:03:33.730> that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
tape measure and draw out that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.090 
tape measure and draw out that
measurement<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.019> got<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.500> rounded<00:03:35.920> mine

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
measurement that you got I rounded mine

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.520 
measurement that you got I rounded mine
up<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.640> 5<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.630> draw<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.989> on<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.350> inner

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
up to 5 so just draw that on the inner

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.920 
up to 5 so just draw that on the inner
corner<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.220> connect<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.060> then<00:03:40.600> from

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
corner and connect that and then from

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.780 
corner and connect that and then from
that<00:03:41.049> arc<00:03:41.680> you're<00:03:41.980> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.310> measure<00:03:42.489> how

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
that arc you're going to measure how

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.940 
that arc you're going to measure how
long<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.299> want<00:03:43.480> your<00:03:43.540> peplum<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.650> video

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
long you want your peplum on this video

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.030 
long you want your peplum on this video
I<00:03:45.280> did<00:03:45.760> seven<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> half<00:03:46.840> inches<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.799> then<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
I did seven and a half inches but then I

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.559 
I did seven and a half inches but then I
realized<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.030> didn't<00:03:49.299> have<00:03:49.390> enough

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
realized that I didn't have enough

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.690 
realized that I didn't have enough
fabric<00:03:49.780> for<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.620> after<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.370> stopped

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
fabric for that so after I stopped

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.699 
fabric for that so after I stopped
recording<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:52.359> went<00:03:52.540> back<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.959> changed<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.470> to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
recording I went back and changed it to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.039 
recording I went back and changed it to
six<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.579> half<00:03:54.609> inches<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.209> all<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.750> need<00:03:55.989> to

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
six and a half inches and all I need to

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.410 
six and a half inches and all I need to
do<00:03:56.170> after<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.889> cut<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.519> shape<00:03:57.790> out<00:03:58.030> just

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
do after that is cut that shape out just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.970 
do after that is cut that shape out just
like<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.600> circle<00:03:58.959> skirt

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.410 

so<00:04:02.980> once<00:04:03.220> it's<00:04:03.400> all<00:04:03.580> cut<00:04:03.849> out<00:04:03.940> you'll<00:04:04.150> end<00:04:04.300> up

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
so once it's all cut out you'll end up

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.600 
so once it's all cut out you'll end up
with<00:04:04.569> two<00:04:04.630> pieces<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.349> this<00:04:05.590> one<00:04:06.310> piece

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
with two pieces like this one piece

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.089 
with two pieces like this one piece
should<00:04:06.880> still<00:04:07.150> have<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.630> ability<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.200> open<00:04:08.709> it

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
should still have the ability to open it

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.790 
should still have the ability to open it
should<00:04:09.459> have<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.940> button<00:04:10.270> in<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.780> so<00:04:11.530> you'll<00:04:11.680> end

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
should have a button in it so you'll end

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.339 
should have a button in it so you'll end
up<00:04:11.950> technically<00:04:12.849> with<00:04:13.150> three<00:04:13.360> pieces<00:04:13.569> place

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
up technically with three pieces place

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.199 
up technically with three pieces place
them<00:04:14.530> right<00:04:14.680> sides<00:04:14.950> together<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.400> sew<00:04:15.610> the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
them right sides together and sew the

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.960 
them right sides together and sew the
two<00:04:16.540> horizontal<00:04:17.200> sides<00:04:17.799> at<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.400> top<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:18.880> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
two horizontal sides at the top so you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.240 
two horizontal sides at the top so you
can<00:04:19.000> make<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.450> complete<00:04:20.019> circle<00:04:20.799> instead<00:04:21.100> of

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
can make a complete circle instead of

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.550 
can make a complete circle instead of
having<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.910> donut<00:04:22.360> have<00:04:22.570> kind<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.080> things<00:04:23.290> so

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
having to donut have kind of things so

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.430 
having to donut have kind of things so
here<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.070> am<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.580> sewing<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:24.940> top<00:04:25.660> vertical

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
here I am just sewing the top vertical

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:36.300 
here I am just sewing the top vertical
pieces<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.820> two<00:04:28.240> donut<00:04:28.990> halves<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.160> now

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
pieces of the two donut halves so now

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.310 
pieces of the two donut halves so now
I'm<00:04:36.460> taking<00:04:36.760> my<00:04:36.790> completed<00:04:37.210> peplum<00:04:37.720> turning

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
I'm taking my completed peplum turning

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.310 
I'm taking my completed peplum turning
it<00:04:38.440> inside<00:04:38.680> out<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.340> upside<00:04:39.880> down<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:40.780> making
