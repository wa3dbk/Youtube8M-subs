it's<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.670> pretty<00:00:38.879> tough<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.450> was

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it's gonna be pretty tough for you I was

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
it's gonna be pretty tough for you I was
talking<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> Kevin<00:00:40.079> before<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> tractor

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.090 
talking to Kevin before over the tractor
and<00:00:42.200> he's<00:00:43.200> been<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.739> 13<00:00:44.070> years

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and he's been here for about 13 years

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.139 
and he's been here for about 13 years
and<00:00:44.309> he<00:00:44.430> thinks<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and he thinks it's gonna be one of the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.770 
and he thinks it's gonna be one of the
biggest<00:00:45.300> games<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> big<00:00:46.710> game<00:00:50.629> no<00:00:51.629> one

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
biggest games it is a big game no one

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.540 
biggest games it is a big game no one
knows<00:00:51.930> more<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.789> peaking<00:00:53.789> early<00:00:54.059> than<00:00:54.539> me

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
knows more about peaking early than me

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.619 
knows more about peaking early than me
the<00:00:56.550> canopy<00:00:56.879> seemed<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.210> peak<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> right

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the canopy seemed to peak at the right

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.180 
the canopy seemed to peak at the right
time<00:00:57.989> yeah<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:58.890> generally

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
time yeah I think so we're generally

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.160 
time yeah I think so we're generally
pretty<00:00:59.670> slow<00:00:59.910> starters<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> must<00:01:00.840> guess<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
pretty slow starters and must guess this

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
pretty slow starters and must guess this
time<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.500> year<00:01:01.590> were<00:01:01.800> stuck<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.280> strips

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
time of year were stuck up there strips

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.579 
time of year were stuck up there strips
and<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.449> sort<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> trial<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.439> well

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
and it sort of trial time that as well

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.899 
and it sort of trial time that as well
I'll<00:01:04.650> try<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> make<00:01:05.040> sure<00:01:05.220> performing<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I'll try and make sure performing it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.280 
I'll try and make sure performing it
right<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> season<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> huddle

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
right into the season but if a huddle

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.190 
right into the season but if a huddle
going<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.590> there<00:01:08.299> as<00:01:09.299> far<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.570> interviews<00:01:10.020> code

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
going on there as far as interviews code

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.300 
going on there as far as interviews code
would<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.439> prefer<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> sort<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
would you prefer that sort of the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.469 
would you prefer that sort of the
one-on-one<00:01:11.549> environment<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.360> having

one-on-one environment like we're having

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
one-on-one environment like we're having
now<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:13.020> maybe<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> more<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> huddle<00:01:14.010> where

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
now or maybe the more of a huddle where

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.980 
now or maybe the more of a huddle where
there's<00:01:14.400> maybe<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> three<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:15.900> four
