kind<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.400> clunky<00:01:52.000> design<00:01:52.120> there's<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.780> lot<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
kind of a clunky design there's a lot of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.930 
kind of a clunky design there's a lot of
other<00:01:53.590> manufacturers<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.640> little

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
other manufacturers that have a little

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.770 
other manufacturers that have a little
better<00:01:55.090> design<00:01:55.420> with<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.780> ResMed<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
better design with that ResMed but this

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.090 
better design with that ResMed but this
works<00:01:59.020> too<00:01:59.140> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:01.810> see<00:02:01.960> how<00:02:02.049> that<00:02:02.170> works<00:02:02.290> the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
works too you can see how that works the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.320 
works too you can see how that works the
diffuser<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.610> right<00:02:03.880> here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
diffuser is right here

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.660 
diffuser is right here
just<00:02:05.049> kind<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.290> shoots<00:02:05.500> down<00:02:05.740> not<00:02:06.370> one<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
just kind of shoots down not one of the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.399 
just kind of shoots down not one of the
best<00:02:06.850> diffusers<00:02:07.299> ever<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.019> actually<00:02:08.349> I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
best diffusers ever this is actually I

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.740 
best diffusers ever this is actually I
think<00:02:08.470> kind<00:02:08.799> of<00:02:08.860> one<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.190> more<00:02:09.750> cheap

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
think kind of one of the more cheap

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.180 
think kind of one of the more cheap
masks<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:12.430> don't<00:02:13.209> particularly<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.629> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
masks and I don't particularly like it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.559 
masks and I don't particularly like it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's it so you do these come through

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's it so you do these come through
here

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
here

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.210 
here
chop-chop<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.090> out<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.540> comes<00:02:37.720> off<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:39.160> I'm

what you just probably take off the
bottom<00:02:42.490> part<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.880> top<00:02:43.030> part<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.380> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
bottom part the top part you have to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.020 
bottom part the top part you have to
undo<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.190> velcro<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:46.150> take<00:02:46.330> off<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.940> now

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
you're just left with the actual mask

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.070 
you're just left with the actual mask
itself<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.610> bridges<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.360> bridge<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.660> can

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
itself the bridges this bridge you can

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.250 
itself the bridges this bridge you can
take<00:02:53.350> off<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:53.800> pretty<00:02:54.040> tricky<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:56.140> can

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
take off it's pretty tricky and it can

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.510 
take off it's pretty tricky and it can
break<00:02:56.410> pretty<00:02:56.650> easily<00:02:56.740> so<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.220> wouldn't<00:02:57.400> really

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
break pretty easily so I wouldn't really

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.020 
break pretty easily so I wouldn't really
recommend<00:02:57.640> doing<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:59.460> but<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.550> bottom<00:03:00.850> part

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
recommend doing it but the bottom part

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.200 
recommend doing it but the bottom part

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
up here can also come off

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.570 
up here can also come off
Mazal<00:03:40.959> do<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.260> as<00:03:41.440> well<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.709> have<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:44.580> so

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
Mazal do that as well I have this so

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.910 
Mazal do that as well I have this so
this<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:46.360> want<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.510> slide<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.470> outside

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
this you want to slide to the outside

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.780 
this you want to slide to the outside
and<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.160> can<00:03:48.220> see<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:48.520> like<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.640> little

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
and you can see there's like a little

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.479 
and you can see there's like a little
groove<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:52.600> thing<00:03:52.810> right<00:03:52.959> there<00:03:53.370> then<00:03:54.370> you

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
groove that thing right there then you

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.090 
groove that thing right there then you
pull<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.940> out<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.540> will<00:03:55.750> slide<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.040> you

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
pull it out and it will slide in so you

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.020 
pull it out and it will slide in so you
do<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.370> both<00:03:57.610> sides<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.090> comes<00:03:58.390> off<00:04:00.030> so

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
do that both sides and that comes off so

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.360 
do that both sides and that comes off so
you're<00:04:01.209> playing<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.720> gel<00:04:02.200> piece<00:04:02.470> back<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
you're playing a gel piece back in you

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.490 
you're playing a gel piece back in you
can<00:04:03.489> see<00:04:03.670> how<00:04:03.820> they're<00:04:03.970> both<00:04:04.300> kind<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.200> shaped

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
can see how they're both kind of shaped

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.990 
can see how they're both kind of shaped
the<00:04:05.650> same<00:04:05.890> it's<00:04:06.100> pretty<00:04:06.310> obvious<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.880> way

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
the same it's pretty obvious the way

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.990 
the same it's pretty obvious the way
they<00:04:07.150> fit<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.450> place<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.930> in

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.580 

and<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:14.990> know<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.230> piece<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:18.200> know<00:04:18.260> all<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and you know this piece you know all the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.680 
and you know this piece you know all the
