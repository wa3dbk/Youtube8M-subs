what's<00:04:42.960> called<00:04:43.170> variant<00:04:43.740> covers<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.310> they<00:04:44.790> may

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
what's called variant covers so they may

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.330 
what's called variant covers so they may
let's<00:04:45.390> say<00:04:45.510> they<00:04:45.660> run<00:04:45.900> 50,000<00:04:46.800> copies<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:47.220> a

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
let's say they run 50,000 copies of a

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.480 
let's say they run 50,000 copies of a
particular<00:04:48.060> title<00:04:48.530> maybe<00:04:49.530> every<00:04:49.920> tenth<00:04:50.190> one

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
particular title maybe every tenth one

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.190 
particular title maybe every tenth one
will<00:04:50.640> have<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.760> different<00:04:51.060> cover<00:04:51.510> on<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.810> then

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
will have a different cover on it then

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.960 
will have a different cover on it then
the<00:04:52.740> standard<00:04:53.280> one<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.640> would<00:04:53.760> pick<00:04:53.880> up

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
the standard one that you would pick up

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.930 
the standard one that you would pick up
in<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.420> convenience<00:04:54.960> store<00:04:55.550> even<00:04:56.550> your<00:04:56.670> local

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
in the convenience store even your local

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.700 
in the convenience store even your local
comic<00:04:57.060> store<00:04:57.390> so<00:04:57.840> there<00:04:58.050> are<00:04:58.080> fewer<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.500> those

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
comic store so there are fewer of those

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.620 
comic store so there are fewer of those
and<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.130> idea<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.610> make<00:04:59.760> those<00:05:00.060> more<00:05:00.300> rare

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
and the idea is to make those more rare

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.010 
and the idea is to make those more rare
and<00:05:00.840> more<00:05:01.560> valuable<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.610> what<00:05:03.510> I've<00:05:03.630> been<00:05:03.780> that

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
and more valuable so what I've been that

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.580 
and more valuable so what I've been that
pic<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.590> do<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.430> do<00:05:05.610> retro<00:05:06.570> style<00:05:06.930> variant

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590
