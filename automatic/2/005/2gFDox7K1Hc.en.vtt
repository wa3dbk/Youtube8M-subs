00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello guys today we are going to prepare those 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.520
 delicious donuts that so much 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.520
 like homer simpson 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.430
 and for this we are going to need 400 grams 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.490
 of flour force 250 ml of milk 70 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.340
 grams of sugar 1 egg a pinch of 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.020
 salt 50 grams of butter one sachet 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.260
 chemical yeast and the skin of a 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.260
 orange 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 and we already have the milk the orange 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.130
 sugar butter yeast 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.170
 flour salt and egg 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.120
 let's start by boiling the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.030
 milk next to the skin of the orange 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 As you can see, the orange should not have 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.330
 no white part because this is what 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.530
 that the bitter 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.250
 Y 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.380
 yes 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 once it starts to boil, we're going to 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.329
 remove from the fire and we will leave 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.089
 temper 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.259
 while with the help of a colander we are going to 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.259
 go sifting the flour 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 now on the flour we put the sugar 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.250
 and the yeast and we 're going to remove it and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.830
 then we will add the teaspoon of salt and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:42.000
 we will move it 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:42.000
 and we're also going to add the egg now 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.259
 as you see only a little 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.780
 now we take a colander and let's strain 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.369
 the milk with the orange on the mixture 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.369
 of flour that we were preparing 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.610
 now finally we add the butter 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.550
 let's knead well until we have left 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.640
 a smooth and satiny homogenous mass 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640
 yes 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.330
 it must be a hydrated mass but not 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.280
 paste once we have it we will form a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.370
 ball and we're going to leave it in a bowl 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.600
 stand for 6 or 8 hours 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.600
 covered with film paper 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.980
 After this time we are going to take 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 the dough and we're going to knead it a little to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 remove all the air and thus be able to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.879
 knead it better 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.250
 and now with the help of a roller we are going to 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.930
 knead the dough we should be a 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.909
 thickness of 1 centimeter plus or minus one 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.220
 Once we have it, we have to prepare 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.720
 the cutters these should be from 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.810
 size we have chosen to make 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.830
 our donuts must be a big one and 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.200
 another one more tiny 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.330
 As you can see, it's a mass that works very 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.500
 easily you just have to place 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:47.290
 your mold and shape 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:49.720
 and now we're going to let them rest on 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.360
 Vegetable paper for leven and gluten 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.390
 settle for about one 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 hour 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.760
 now with the help of scissors we are going to 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.650
 cut the vegetable paper leaving a 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.220
 small margin around our 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.780
 donuts and you will ask and why then 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.540
 I will explain what we are going to do 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.370
 is frying them with the vegetable paper this is going 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.330
 to make our donuts do not sink 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.250
 swell much better 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:29.800
 once the hot oil is in 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.960
 let's go frying little by little when 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.000
 have a golden color that we like 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.650
 let's turn it around but always 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.650
 leaving them on top of the vegetable paper 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.370
 and once they're golden by the two 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.530
 we are going to take them out and we are going 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.220
 to put on a plate with kitchen paper 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.830
 so they run well 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.870
 now we go with the glaze we have the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 marmalade sugar glass and water 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.560
 hot the first thing we're going to do is 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.550
 that with a strainer we are going to eliminate the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.550
 lumps of jam 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.980
 you 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.409
 once we have it we are going to add everything 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.299
 the icing sugar and we're going to stir in this 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.329
 step guys the jam can be of 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:18.249
 taste that you like but do not forget 

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:21.549
 that is going to be the color that is going to 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.439
 stay in your glitter and now for 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:25.659
 Last we will add a little water 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:29.589
 if we want it to be more liquid 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:31.419
 we will add more water and as you see guys 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.859
 this is the texture that for me is the 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.869
 perfect 

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:37.299
 now let's take our donuts and what 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:40.029
 let's bathe we introduce a little 

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:41.689
 over fat and let it drain 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.679
 a little 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.679
 Y 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.160
 Now we add a little bit of shavings 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.340
 colors to give that touch of homer 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.340
 simpson 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.360
 we have chocolate melted sugar icing 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.340
 butter and water now to chocolate 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.930
 We are going to add all the sugar 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.930
 glas and we will remove it 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.229
 we also add butter now 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.969
 that like chocolate is still warm 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.969
 will help it melt better 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.540
 finally we are going to add a little bit of 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.960
 water until you get the thickness that 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.960
 want 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.700
 this is the texture that I have wished 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.710
 for chocolate and now we're going to do 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.420
 the same we take our donuts and what 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.930
 we are going to bathe in chocolate 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.200
 we let it drain a little bit and we're going to 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.040
 add some colorful shavings and what 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.040
 let's dry 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.909
 now we have icing sugar and water this 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.849
 we have to mix that we were going to 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.849
 get the typical icing of the donuts 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.850
 once we have the desired texture 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.750
 let's soak the donuts but this time 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.750
 by both parties 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:33.900
 well guys we already have our donuts 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:36.949
 classic our chocolate donuts 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:41.790
 and the favorite donut of homer simpson 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:46.500
