00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.549
 the four days must no longer have higher rating 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.669
 okay so that it can have advantages 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.770
 should this be said if you do not have 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.069

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.339
 2-4 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.939
 ok talking about the right hand 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.009
 so in this style 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.009
 the right hand and cliff lee pace 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.800
