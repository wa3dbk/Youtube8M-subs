00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.410
 we see 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 here exaggerated trip suits 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.160
 ISI version 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 and you could then go here

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.410
 exactly 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.410
 then you go around 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 on download 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.200
 and then you would see that you will not be redirected because of consequences 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.930
 other page for documentation 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.720

 and I did not need it anymore 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.399
 they are not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.049
 two come 5 MB or so 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049

 around my own one Teamspeak server and one perplexed clock for ten slots 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.399
 and 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.930
 to get blogging on it now gt ob

 Trasona now we are now too, for example 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 the hardware rum where the server is 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.669
 around 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
 how equipped is the server 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.129
 and 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.129
 Come switching and here it looks all this stuff 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.789
 For this SCS Hermann Maier start died stopped and Delhi would have to kind 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.080

 I really new to it 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.119
 then you have to go forces here 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:53.349
 plague us 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.809
 And besides, conjure up magic and here it could be a pity but easy 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:57.499
 Upload 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.659
 that's not hard 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.009
 Choose a file 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.890

 and on pharmacies 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.919
 he tells 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.289
 the part successfully gifted that sounds good 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.590
 and 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.000
 Now, yes, must be found here somewhere 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.319
 here he is 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.800
 and that was it for now here and here only then he is still going on 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.639
 Restart the server 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.389
 then you will be asked again here 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.620

 the hall is now 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.139
 or would have to 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.189
 the charm of one can but mistake right now 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.509
 and then they can actually spend the fixed Euro on their backs 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.139
 So the blog had theoretically ripped on myself in the must here 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.939

 unforgettable to comment 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.629
 and such a dream 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.779
 then I'll do it, I think I'll continue to have the confirmation what 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.059
 you have helped further 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.889
