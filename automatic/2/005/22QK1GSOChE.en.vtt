00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.189 
have an alive soil over time soil tends
to<00:00:18.380> lose<00:00:19.490> its<00:00:20.490> energy<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> speak<00:00:21.600> its<00:00:21.930> life

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to lose its energy so to speak its life

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.189 
to lose its energy so to speak its life
so<00:00:23.070> therefore<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.180> first<00:00:24.480> thing<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.140> to

little bit of decomposed granite will
help<00:01:26.280> too<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> lot<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> keep

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
try not to till the soil very much until

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.080 
try not to till the soil very much until
planning<00:01:49.009> because<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> want<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> hold<00:01:50.850> as

planning because you want to hold as

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.069 
planning because you want to hold as
much<00:01:51.329> moisture<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> soil<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.490> there

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
much moisture in that soil that's there

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.260 
much moisture in that soil that's there
every<00:01:55.079> time<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.560> till<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> loosen<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> up

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
every time you till it and loosen it up

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.219 
every time you till it and loosen it up
the<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.680> moisture<00:01:59.219> will<00:01:59.969> disperse<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.960> into

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the the moisture will disperse out into

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.389 
the the moisture will disperse out into
the<00:02:01.350> air<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:03.180> dries<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.950> keep

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the air and that dries it out so keep

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.249 
the air and that dries it out so keep
don't<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.780> much<00:02:07.069> tilling<00:02:08.069> or<00:02:08.310> digging
