the box so let's take a look on how this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
the box so let's take a look on how this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.389 

so<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> box<00:00:52.920> just

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
so when you take it out of the box just

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.760 
so when you take it out of the box just
pretty<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.910> looks<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.559> mine's<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
pretty much what it looks like mine's a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.650 
pretty much what it looks like mine's a
little<00:00:55.800> orange<00:00:56.190> reddish<00:00:56.820> color<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.629> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
completely clear back opposed to the sub

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
completely clear back opposed to the sub
cases<00:01:02.040> i<00:01:02.129> reviewed<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> completely

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.190 
cases i reviewed this one is completely
clear<00:01:03.769> it's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.890> pretty<00:01:05.129> thick<00:01:05.750> case<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.049> not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
clear it's a pretty thick case it's not

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
is the case for you the buttons on there

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.580 
is the case for you the buttons on there
as<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> most<00:01:21.470> responsive<00:01:22.470> i've

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
as well have the most responsive i've

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.550 
as well have the most responsive i've
ever<00:01:22.680> felt<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.369> case<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.149> far<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:25.289> buttons

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
ever felt on a case so far the buttons

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
ever felt on a case so far the buttons
are<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:25.830> deep<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.160> there<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.759> tap

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
are really deep in there so when you tap

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.150 
are really deep in there so when you tap
that<00:01:27.149> actually<00:01:28.020> reaches<00:01:28.380> into<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.800> phone's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
that actually reaches into the phone's

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.969 
that actually reaches into the phone's
internal<00:01:29.970> buttons<00:01:30.360> also<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.410> pretty

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
internal buttons also so that pretty

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.770 
internal buttons also so that pretty
much<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.429> good<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.119> sometimes<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.690> have

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
much is good because sometimes you have

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.999 
much is good because sometimes you have
to<00:01:33.840> push<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.170> hard<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.679> ones<00:01:34.890> are

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to push really hard but these ones are

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.310 
to push really hard but these ones are
pretty<00:01:35.070> deep<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.539> single<00:01:36.810> tap<00:01:37.110> will

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
pretty deep in that a single tap will

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.210 
pretty deep in that a single tap will
activate<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.830> buttons<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.929> for<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.070> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
activate the buttons so for the way that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
activate the buttons so for the way that
it<00:01:41.310> looks<00:01:41.960> looks<00:01:42.960> amazing<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.039> is<00:01:44.159> outside

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it looks looks amazing this is outside

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.070 
it looks looks amazing this is outside
so<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.819> looks<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.600> red<00:01:45.840> just

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
so it looks a little bit more red just

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.290 
so it looks a little bit more red just
due<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> color<00:01:46.679> reproduction<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.550> but
