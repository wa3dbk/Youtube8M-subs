00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.860 
many many years it is still my favorite
time<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.919> in<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.189> store<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.760> after<00:03:35.750> we

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
time to be in the store is after we

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.439 
time to be in the store is after we
close<00:03:36.169> go<00:03:36.889> out<00:03:37.040> for<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.310> drink<00:03:37.549> maybe<00:03:37.879> come<00:03:38.239> back

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
close go out for a drink maybe come back

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.140 
close go out for a drink maybe come back
and<00:03:38.750> three<00:03:39.470> o'clock<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.040> magic<00:03:40.669> time<00:03:40.909> here

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and three o'clock is the magic time here

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.999 
and three o'clock is the magic time here
because<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.479> streets<00:03:41.750> have<00:03:41.900> gone<00:03:42.049> quiet<00:03:42.319> the

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:43.009 
because the streets have gone quiet the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.039 
because the streets have gone quiet the
bars<00:03:43.220> have<00:03:43.459> let<00:03:43.639> out<00:03:43.819> and<00:03:44.659> so<00:03:44.810> there's<00:03:44.989> a

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
bars have let out and so there's a

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.770 
bars have let out and so there's a
stillness<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:46.189> on<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.639> streets<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.239> there's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
stillness out on the streets and there's

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.569 
stillness out on the streets and there's
a<00:03:47.840> stillness<00:03:48.229> and<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> store<00:03:48.919> and<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.370> sit

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
a stillness and the store and to sit

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.159

quietly in the store at that at that

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.110 
quietly in the store at that at that
moment<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.650> still<00:03:51.739> was<00:03:52.250> still<00:03:52.519> kind<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.879> one<00:03:53.030> of

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
moment is still was still kind of one of

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.749 
moment is still was still kind of one of
my<00:03:53.180> favorite<00:03:53.540> things<00:03:54.189> probably<00:03:55.189> the<00:03:55.609> most

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
my favorite things probably the most

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
important thing that we do is that city

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.710 
important thing that we do is that city
lights<00:03:58.729> is<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:58.909> beacon<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.419> what's<00:03:59.629> possible

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
lights is a beacon of what's possible

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.599 
lights is a beacon of what's possible
the<00:04:00.259> books<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.560> reside<00:04:01.009> here<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.430> our

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the books that reside here on our

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.770 
the books that reside here on our
shelves<00:04:02.150> are<00:04:02.530> each<00:04:03.530> one<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.889> them<00:04:04.009> kind<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.430> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
shelves are each one of them kind of a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.509 
shelves are each one of them kind of a
possible<00:04:05.780> way<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:05.989> look<00:04:06.349> at<00:04:06.439> the<00:04:06.530> world<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:07.370> be

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
possible way to look at the world to be

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.189 
possible way to look at the world to be
in<00:04:07.639> the<00:04:07.729> world<00:04:07.879> to<00:04:08.030> impact<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:08.569> world<00:04:08.720> or<00:04:09.019> to

in the world to impact the world or to

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.469 
in the world to impact the world or to
kind<00:04:09.349> of<00:04:09.470> understand<00:04:10.009> the<00:04:10.159> world<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.209> think
