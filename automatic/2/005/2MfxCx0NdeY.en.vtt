favorite roads around here and you know
just<00:00:07.700> give<00:00:08.700> her<00:00:08.790> some<00:00:08.910> throttle<00:00:09.090> not<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.809> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
just give her some throttle not have to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.009 
just give her some throttle not have to
worry<00:00:10.110> about<00:00:10.290> any<00:00:10.710> other<00:00:10.889> cars<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> road

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
worry about any other cars on the road

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.530 
worry about any other cars on the road
but<00:00:13.019> uh<00:00:13.049> yeah<00:00:13.950> these<00:00:14.190> coilovers<00:00:14.790> make<00:00:15.000> such<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
but uh yeah these coilovers make such a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.480 
but uh yeah these coilovers make such a
big<00:00:15.719> difference<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.320> pretty<00:00:16.590> much<00:00:16.680> eliminated

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
big difference it pretty much eliminated

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.570 
big difference it pretty much eliminated
body<00:00:17.789> roll<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.320> it<00:00:19.320> inspires<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.430> much

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
body roll and it inspires so much

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.859 
body roll and it inspires so much
confidence<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.240> you're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.539> around<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
confidence as you're going around a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.970 
confidence as you're going around a
corner<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> give<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
corner like you just want to give it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
corner like you just want to give it
more<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> more<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:25.019> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
more and more at all but it's it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.300 
more and more at all but it's it's
dangerous<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:27.260> also<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.949> found<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
dangerous and also one thing I found is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.470 
dangerous and also one thing I found is
that<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.670> eliminates<00:00:31.460> wheel<00:00:32.460> hop<00:00:32.700> which<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that it eliminates wheel hop which is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
that it eliminates wheel hop which is
good<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> stock<00:00:34.500> springs<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
good because in the stock springs if I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
good because in the stock springs if I
gave<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> throttle<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.420> any<00:00:36.660> unsettling

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gave a throttle over like any unsettling

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
gave a throttle over like any unsettling
bump<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.980> anything<00:00:38.370> my<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.570> end<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.899> just

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
bump or anything my back end would just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
bump or anything my back end would just
be<00:00:40.200> hopping<00:00:40.710> around<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.430> good<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.210> if

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
be hopping around for like good like if

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.580 
be hopping around for like good like if
I<00:00:42.420> didn't<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> throttle<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.440> I'm

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I didn't get off the throttle and I'm

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
I didn't get off the throttle and I'm
pretty<00:00:43.800> sure<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> would<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.280> stay<00:00:44.610> chirping

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
pretty sure it would just stay chirping

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
pretty sure it would just stay chirping
mhm<00:00:47.480> um<00:00:48.480> yeah<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.239> I'm

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
mhm um yeah so I actually think I'm

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
mhm um yeah so I actually think I'm
gonna<00:00:51.510> raise<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> rear<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.829> bit

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
gonna raise the rear a little bit

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
gonna raise the rear a little bit
because<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> little<00:00:53.879> too<00:00:54.090> low

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
because I think it's a little too low

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
because I think it's a little too low
for<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.750> liking<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> front

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
for my liking I like the way the front

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.750 
for my liking I like the way the front
is<00:00:56.969> set<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.739> think<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> front<00:00:59.070> looks<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is set I think the front looks good you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.850 
is set I think the front looks good you
know<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> still<00:01:00.239> has<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.449> oh<00:01:02.420> no<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> has

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
know it still has the oh no like it has

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.289 
know it still has the oh no like it has
like<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.129> tuner<00:01:05.369> look<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> doesn't<00:01:06.210> look

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
like a tuner look but it doesn't look

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.370 
like a tuner look but it doesn't look
like<00:01:06.360> hella<00:01:06.720> stands<00:01:07.229> flush<00:01:07.770> yo<00:01:08.220> oh<00:01:08.960> no<00:01:09.960> no<00:01:10.110> I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
probably gonna end up taking that route

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
probably gonna end up taking that route
anyway<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> low<00:01:13.500> offset<00:01:13.710> wheels

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
anyway with like the low offset wheels

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.570 
anyway with like the low offset wheels
and<00:01:14.750> mm-hmm<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> negative<00:01:17.130> camber<00:01:17.310> and

but then once i put in the coilovers it
was<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.070> night<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.399> day<00:01:56.579> honestly<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.570> was

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
was like night and day honestly it was

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.370 
was like night and day honestly it was
it<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.710> crazy<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.329> actually<00:02:00.329> since<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.259> are

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it was crazy I actually since they are

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
it was crazy I actually since they are
adjustable<00:02:01.979> dampening<00:02:02.430> coilovers<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.270> did

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
adjustable dampening coilovers I did

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.530 
adjustable dampening coilovers I did
make<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.469> bit<00:02:04.710> softer<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:06.210> because

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
make it a little bit softer just because

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.730 
make it a little bit softer just because
often<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> focus

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
often going on a focus

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.870 
often going on a focus
but<00:02:08.950> yeah<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.160> didn't<00:02:09.400> make<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.610> little<00:02:09.730> bit

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
but yeah I didn't make it a little bit

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.150 
but yeah I didn't make it a little bit
softer<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.450> because<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.810> how<00:02:10.990> how<00:02:11.800> stiff<00:02:12.070> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
softer just because of how how stiff it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.360 
softer just because of how how stiff it
was<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:13.150> was<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.570> kind<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:15.220> of

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
was that was really kind of kind of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.910 
was that was really kind of kind of
harsh<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.850> took<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> highway<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
harsh I took it on the highway and the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.800 
harsh I took it on the highway and the
pumps<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.490> highway<00:02:18.820> are<00:02:18.970> extremely

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
pumps on the highway are extremely

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.800 
pumps on the highway are extremely
violent<00:02:20.160> it's<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.460> loud<00:02:21.940> clunk<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
violent it's just like a loud clunk and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the whole car just kind of I don't like

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.620 
the whole car just kind of I don't like
it<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:27.300> um<00:02:28.350> besides<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:30.540> don't<00:02:31.540> really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
it but um besides that I don't really

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.360 
it but um besides that I don't really
have<00:02:31.780> any<00:02:31.960> complaints<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.590> mean<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.860> rear<00:02:33.070> are

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370

have any complaints I mean the rear are
making<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> rears<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.170> making<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
making one of the rears is making like a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.730 
making one of the rears is making like a
little<00:02:36.100> bit<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.120> swishing<00:02:37.510> sound<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.650> i'm

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
little bit of a swishing sound but i'm

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.500 
little bit of a swishing sound but i'm
not<00:02:38.860> sure<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.490> that's<00:02:39.760> because<00:02:40.060> they're<00:02:40.240> new

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
not sure if that's because they're new

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.920 
not sure if that's because they're new
or<00:02:40.540> not<00:02:41.170> or<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.910> hopefully<00:02:42.910> it's<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.450> won't<00:02:43.720> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
or not or if hopefully it's it won't it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.900 
or not or if hopefully it's it won't it
won't<00:02:43.960> get<00:02:44.170> worse<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.620> anything<00:02:44.970> but<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.760> it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
won't get worse or anything but if it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.280 
won't get worse or anything but if it
does<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.120> it's<00:02:49.450> stuck<00:02:49.690> because<00:02:49.870> i'm<00:02:50.050> stuck

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
does that it's stuck because i'm stuck

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.810 
does that it's stuck because i'm stuck
with<00:02:50.320> these<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:50.890> i'm<00:02:51.070> broke<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.580> this

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
with these because i'm broke and this

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.270 
with these because i'm broke and this
was<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> gift<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:54.010> um<00:02:54.360> yeah<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:56.320> far<00:02:56.590> i'm<00:02:56.890> pretty

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
was a gift but um yeah so far i'm pretty

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
happy with them besides the fact of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.490 
happy with them besides the fact of
during<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.970> installation<00:03:01.240> i<00:03:01.750> snapped<00:03:02.110> three

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
during the installation i snapped three

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.470 
during the installation i snapped three
sockets<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.280> an<00:03:03.400> extension<00:03:03.970> trying<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.360> get

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
sockets and an extension trying to get

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.890 
sockets and an extension trying to get
these<00:03:04.690> things<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.940> i<00:03:06.970> guess<00:03:07.510> that's<00:03:07.780> what

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
these things on but i guess that's what

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.590 
these things on but i guess that's what
i<00:03:08.320> get<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.650> not<00:03:08.920> having<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.370> grade<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.360> tools

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
i get for not having that grade of tools

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.140 
i get for not having that grade of tools
i'm<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.110> house<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.850> um<00:03:15.720> yeah<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.430> JS<00:03:18.430> case<00:03:18.700> sorry

i'm a house but um yeah so JS case sorry
i<00:03:19.360> keep<00:03:19.570> going<00:03:19.990> off<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.560> topic<00:03:21.430> here

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
i keep going off the topic here

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.289 
i keep going off the topic here
but<00:03:27.280> they're<00:03:28.280> pretty<00:03:28.400> they're<00:03:28.519> pretty<00:03:28.790> simple

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
but they're pretty they're pretty simple

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.850 
but they're pretty they're pretty simple
to<00:03:29.390> use<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.780> mean<00:03:30.019> it's<00:03:30.470> like<00:03:30.650> any<00:03:30.799> other

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
to use I mean it's like any other

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.860 
to use I mean it's like any other
adjustable<00:03:31.459> coilover<00:03:32.440> but<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:34.659> kind<00:03:35.659> of<00:03:35.720> like

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
adjustable coilover but I kind of like

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.630 
adjustable coilover but I kind of like
to<00:03:35.900> dampening<00:03:36.440> that<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:37.190> mean<00:03:37.519> it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
to dampening that they have I mean it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.150 
to dampening that they have I mean it's
the<00:03:37.700> cheapest<00:03:38.739> adjustable<00:03:39.739> dampening

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the cheapest adjustable dampening

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.369 
the cheapest adjustable dampening
coilover<00:03:40.580> i<00:03:40.610> found<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.209> i<00:03:41.629> saw<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.049> forums

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
coilover i found and i saw on the forums

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.960 
coilover i found and i saw on the forums
and<00:03:42.410> everything<00:03:42.769> people<00:03:43.489> don't<00:03:43.640> really<00:03:43.790> have

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and everything people don't really have

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.369 
and everything people don't really have
anything<00:03:44.150> against<00:03:44.629> them<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.019> then<00:03:45.260> again

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
anything against them but then again

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.869 
anything against them but then again
there<00:03:45.650> wasn't<00:03:45.799> really<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.099> lot<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.400> information

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
there wasn't really a lot of information

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.630 
there wasn't really a lot of information
on<00:03:47.000> them<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.989> i<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:49.099> know<00:03:49.160> i<00:03:49.190> thought<00:03:49.459> i'd

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
on them so i don't know i thought i'd

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.400 
on them so i don't know i thought i'd
just<00:03:49.790> try<00:03:50.150> them<00:03:50.299> out<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.480> if<00:03:50.780> they<00:03:50.900> work<00:03:51.079> great

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
just try them out and if they work great

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.869 
just try them out and if they work great
but<00:03:51.560> if<00:03:51.829> they<00:03:51.950> don't<00:03:52.099> that<00:03:52.400> sucks<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.379> am<00:03:55.370> I

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
but if they don't that sucks so I am I

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.660 
but if they don't that sucks so I am I
took<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.180> risk<00:03:56.329> with<00:03:56.450> these
