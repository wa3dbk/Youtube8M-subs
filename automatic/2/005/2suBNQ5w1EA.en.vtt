00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.310
 cat 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.680
 presents and if we kill them the see with the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.680
 face here but just like these 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.390
 they defend all 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.870
 the verb that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.870
 let's give it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:46.880
 I deserve it strong lying wall 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:46.880
 determined that attacked that dragon lot 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.440
 whoever was most serious says look 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 hopefully 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 i 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.600
 is your whore basinger 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.890
 but is that you can use transposition with 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.890
 so that if we do not intimidate ourselves more 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.550
 as soon as the mask 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.170
 here are the faces 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.259
 from s 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.880
 grobas the invi papillas with silence 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.330
 the chapel of silence want 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.229
 and sacks day 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.610
 so they stick critical but we do not kill it 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.760
 and we kill him that simple of his and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.210
 we remain he does not move he leaves you the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:36.110
 space 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.110
 at 4 pm and they say mt men 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.650
 ah 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.660
 the fucking shit 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 what 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.610
 It's okay because you threw this shit out of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.040
 when 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.900
 I will not lie 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.630
 but there are three pages saved 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.160
 transposition there it reads already clear 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.010
 hit him with a sword and an assault and a 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.569
 transco 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.129
 and trans 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.129
 and the fucking gsm 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.999
 we have another lathe to discard them 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.510
 man data plate and is well stable his 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 function 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 I do not think at least but good if not 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.940
 you have 14 p as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.959
 Mr 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.670
 help look critical critical critics 25 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.670
 4 other criteria 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.430
 but not 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.030
 very good
