00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
good job of updating the levels so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.999 
good job of updating the levels so
they're<00:01:36.630> new<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.080> still<00:01:37.409> feel<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> old

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
game still it's a fun game and the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770 
game still it's a fun game and the
multiplayer<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> fun<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.450> shooting

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
multiplayer is a lot of fun the shooting

mechanics<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:01.350> done<00:02:01.530> well<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> entire

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
mechanics are done well but the entire

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
mechanics are done well but the entire
game<00:02:02.700> feels<00:02:03.090> more<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.479> budget<00:02:03.869> title

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
game feels more like a budget title

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
game feels more like a budget title
because<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.560> graphics<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because of the graphics and some of the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.660 
because of the graphics and some of the
animations<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> bit<00:02:06.780> off<00:02:07.459> honestly<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
animations are a bit off honestly this

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.240

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
game is a year old and very little has

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.979 
game is a year old and very little has
been<00:02:11.489> changed<00:02:11.850> since<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> wii<00:02:12.360> iteration<00:02:12.930> of

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
been changed since the wii iteration of

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.020 
been changed since the wii iteration of
the<00:02:13.110> game<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.890> still<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> fun<00:02:14.489> game<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the game it's still a fun game and a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.630 
the game it's still a fun game and a
decent<00:02:15.209> bond<00:02:15.630> title<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.799> my<00:02:16.920> opinion<00:02:17.010> it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
decent bond title but in my opinion it's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.539 
decent bond title but in my opinion it's
not<00:02:17.910> worth<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.329> full<00:02:18.540> retail<00:02:18.989> price<00:02:19.549> though

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
not worth the full retail price though

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.069 
not worth the full retail price though
