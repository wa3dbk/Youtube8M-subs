00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hello again to annoy 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 I have the preliminary hardware now 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.440
 built not said it has tentatively 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 because first, the cpu cooler is too thick 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 as you can see here 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.160
 and second, I'm not sure yet 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.160
 am i here the gtx 760 word 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.149
 will use 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 maybe you can see between 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:42.870
 graphics card on the power supply is exactly no 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.780
 place fits more but one to the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.469
 airflow will pass on 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.390
 not quite work though 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 Nevertheless, the gambling is the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.379
 graphics card not warmer than 80 degrees what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.510
 actually should be in the frame something 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 still, of course, the increases 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.430
 volume so if I notice 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 or completed then we have the fan 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.880
 with 80 percent and that's it 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 really loud 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.560
 I'll give it a little if you then 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.530
 a folding bed turn that the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.770
 first and quiet the housing others 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.770
 can 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.390
 above is native 2220 ministers bring the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:46.350
 on standard housing lÃ¼bzer I will 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:46.350
 Kick force acts already clearly 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.490
 I know a pity that find it here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.140
 the pretty fan just 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.500
 Well, that does not really matter much 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.510
 sense because here on the whole page 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.420
 There is absolutely nothing now 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.010
 somehow much cooling would be needed 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.369
 notes up here comes karl the air 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.990
 get out of here when the pc gets warm 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.710
 just get out of the air by being too good 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.710
 a bit too bad 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.760
 it is just too bad the arrangement 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 from the built-in power supply I know 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.530
 What she can do it just because of that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.400
 I just power in the middle market 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 attractive the power supply long ago in the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.390
 in the middle and why do you build something like that ? 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.580
 why I think you have the power supply 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.010
 For example, right here on the edge 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.110
 pushed then you would have at least yes 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.930
 a three-inch wide strip 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.060
 from the graphics card with airflow 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.010
 can provide 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.380
 but that's just how it works 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.770
 not at all 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.420
 and yes, I'll have a look maybe 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.640
 if the housing is up to maybe 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.360
 brings the total total 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.860
 you still have something to do 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.390
 then wait and see 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.220
 I thought you could do that 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.459
 power adapter maybe turn and here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.080
 build in front because I do not have a slot in 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.610
 drive use we want to place it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.360
 for the dimensions of the whole wants synonymous 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.340
 still fit 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.800
 then you could do that 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.489
 graphics card needs a lot of air intake 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:25.350
 but I still succumbed to the 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:27.000
 i am going now i know now that 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.280
 Except I tested it 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.780
 yesterday 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.780
 you still have nothing 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.530
 some it goes up a bit with the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.530
 exhibition 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.030
 so i'll get back to you 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.400
 now even at 90 degrees 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.310
 It should be warmer but experience 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.960
 not be 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.000
 Now, for a short time, the graphics cards 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.630
 to stop the fan so we believe today 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.630
 that's all 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.930
 that the power supply 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:55.900
 yes that was for the first time if you 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.030
 then there is a short report 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.419
 you could write the comments what 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.419
 for cpu cooler here but he recommend 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.479
 May not be higher than 15 centimeters 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.960
 wide and fits the possibility you 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.960
 to do humor
