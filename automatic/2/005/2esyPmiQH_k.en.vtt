00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:23.360 
you know is you there nine if you use
you<00:04:12.280> know<00:04:12.780> more<00:04:13.780> melody<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> flavor<00:04:15.180> with<00:04:16.180> there

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.560 

so<00:04:24.370> that's<00:04:24.580> what<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:24.760> hear<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.540> hard

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
so that's what I hear on and it's hard

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.600 
so that's what I hear on and it's hard
to<00:04:25.870> hear<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.470> bear<00:04:26.680> with<00:04:26.710> me<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.160> I

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
to hear just bear with me because I

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.000 
to hear just bear with me because I
don't<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.540> CD<00:04:29.140> but<00:04:29.410> it's<00:04:29.740> kind<00:04:29.950> of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
don't have it the CD but it's kind of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.500 
don't have it the CD but it's kind of
hard<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> hear<00:04:30.460> on<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.700> youtubes<00:04:31.120> because

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
hard to hear on the youtubes because

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.130 
hard to hear on the youtubes because
it's<00:04:31.690> really<00:04:31.870> low<00:04:32.170> on<00:04:32.470> mine<00:04:33.540> but<00:04:34.540> that's<00:04:34.870> what

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
it's really low on mine but that's what

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.720 
it's really low on mine but that's what
I<00:04:35.170> hear<00:04:35.440> at<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.650> beginning<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.250> could<00:04:36.430> be<00:04:36.520> wrong

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
I hear at the beginning I could be wrong

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.420 
I hear at the beginning I could be wrong
so<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.150> can<00:04:37.390> take<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.110> know<00:04:38.920> I<00:04:38.950> kind<00:04:39.310> of

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
so you can take that you know I kind of

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.310 
so you can take that you know I kind of
flip<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:40.150> how<00:04:40.240> do<00:04:40.300> you<00:04:40.450> want<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.290> think

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
flip but how do you want and I think

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920 
flip but how do you want and I think
when<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.770> go<00:04:41.890> into<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.160> modulation<00:04:42.930> he's

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
when you go into that modulation he's

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.050 
when you go into that modulation he's
going<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.500> b-flat<00:04:44.860> major<00:04:45.190> say<00:04:45.550> myself<00:04:45.760> you

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.460
