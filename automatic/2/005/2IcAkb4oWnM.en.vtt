so our car stopped flashing on the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.440 
so our car stopped flashing on the
screen<00:03:32.040> let's<00:03:32.459> start<00:03:32.670> playing<00:03:32.910> together<00:03:33.000> and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:04:03.869 
seriously excuse for messenger so let's
start<00:03:36.360> take<00:03:36.569> one<00:03:36.840> two<00:03:37.049> three

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.929 

I<00:04:07.680> think<00:04:08.680> on<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.920> soul<00:04:09.159> of<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> song<00:04:09.730> which

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
I think on the soul of the song which

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:16.039 
I think on the soul of the song which
actually<00:04:10.329> begins<00:04:10.659> form<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.829> third<00:04:12.040> string

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
