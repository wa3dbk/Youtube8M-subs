00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.380

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.660
 what else could there be done 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.500

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:33.840
 Needless to say stickers put 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:37.570
 here so well, as I understand it here 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.180
 Most of the details of my three machines 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.180
 Most of the details were typewriter dock 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:52.080
 Hudson and I think so okay and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:56.430
 here you see already a typewriter you yes 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:00.280
 let 's see it from all sides 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:05.850
 at first here you see 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:10.360
 wheels two wheels mirror here here 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.150
 100 guns master class q10 and all glass 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.830
 glue well maybe i have some 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.739
 not exactly stuck because well modelku 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:26.260
 small stickers small sticky 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:38.080
 uncomfortable now look back here 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:42.270
 trunk bumper here also is in 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.130
 another god she is no different and 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:54.730
 I sat down as I have said many times 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:57.280
 wheels do not move and front to front 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.690
 on such a nice cute machine 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.960
 it just looks like a smile on 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.960
 face 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:14.319
 now let's look at it from above 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.319
 here on top she looks like that 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:21.139
 here and here on his roof so 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:27.229
 little thing is I do not know what to do with her 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:31.309
 will look more requested so still 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:35.719
 what I want to say that this machine she told me 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:39.529
 really like but she has one minus what 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:44.359
 she is very small she is 5 long 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:47.689
 centimeters and other cars here were but 

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:50.839
 i collect carcinoma film so i think 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:53.479
 that lightning mcqueen is small here but i 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:56.629
 I see that probably all this collection 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:01.609
 The smallest machine is such Widgeon 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:04.099
 beautiful colorful all on a little it 

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:07.339
 Of course I am a small country minus 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:12.549
 little here but she doesn't care 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:12.549
 like so here and looked 

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.239
 So 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:29.470
 the truth is so small 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:32.600
 huge box the difference of course is 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.880
 the box is big because I'm already in it 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:41.690
 not finished machine there is only a part 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:46.070
 instruction so here's all i'm 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:49.900
 I wanted to say again that I 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:54.680
 I decided to collect the full collection and soon I 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:58.520
 soon i will buy concerning 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.940
 models for my collection here in principle 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:06.160
