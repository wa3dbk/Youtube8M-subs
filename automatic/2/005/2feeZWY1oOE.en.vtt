another corner quote from Felipe Santana
but<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.800> reason<00:05:07.979> that<00:05:08.219> this<00:05:08.310> game<00:05:08.550> was<00:05:08.639> so

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
but the reason that this game was so

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.149 
but the reason that this game was so
frustrating<00:05:09.360> is<00:05:09.509> because<00:05:09.840> he<00:05:10.319> literally<00:05:10.590> was

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
frustrating is because he literally was

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.540 
frustrating is because he literally was
never<00:05:11.849> in<00:05:12.330> my<00:05:12.569> final<00:05:12.870> third<00:05:13.289> unless<00:05:13.949> he<00:05:14.189> was<00:05:14.310> on

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
never in my final third unless he was on

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.309 
never in my final third unless he was on
a<00:05:14.580> break<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.479> that's<00:05:15.629> what<00:05:15.810> he<00:05:15.930> was<00:05:16.050> playing

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
a break and that's what he was playing

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.469 
a break and that's what he was playing
for<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.770> that's<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.159> frustrating<00:05:17.729> part<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
for and that's the frustrating part I

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.899 
for and that's the frustrating part I
think<00:05:18.509> about<00:05:18.930> FIFA<00:05:19.409> and<00:05:19.439> I<00:05:20.009> think<00:05:20.550> why<00:05:20.669> some

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
think about FIFA and I think why some

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.519 
think about FIFA and I think why some
people<00:05:21.180> have<00:05:21.210> gotten<00:05:21.509> really<00:05:21.659> turned<00:05:22.020> off<00:05:22.289> to

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
people have gotten really turned off to

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:23.959 
people have gotten really turned off to

the sudden to me it seemed like it's a

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.180 
the sudden to me it seemed like it's a
crazy<00:05:29.430> crazy<00:05:29.940> factor<00:05:30.659> this<00:05:30.870> year<00:05:31.190> especially

should have just kept sprinting in and
ripped<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:58.949> but<00:05:59.189> I<00:05:59.219> thought<00:05:59.430> his<00:05:59.550> keeper<00:05:59.819> was

00:05:59.929 --> 00:05:59.939

also wondering if I'm going to be live
streaming<00:07:53.129> today<00:07:53.310> the<00:07:53.550> answer<00:07:53.939> to<00:07:54.089> that<00:07:54.180> is

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 
streaming today the answer to that is

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.969 
streaming today the answer to that is
more<00:07:54.569> than<00:07:54.719> likely<00:07:54.899> yes<00:07:55.289> for<00:07:55.589> a<00:07:55.620> little<00:07:55.770> while

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 
more than likely yes for a little while

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:59.329 
more than likely yes for a little while
so<00:07:56.580> once<00:07:57.089> this<00:07:57.270> video<00:07:57.659> closes<00:07:58.620> in<00:07:58.649> on<00:07:58.889> being<00:07:59.159> up

00:07:59.329 --> 00:07:59.339 
so once this video closes in on being up

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.980 
so once this video closes in on being up
for<00:07:59.639> I<00:07:59.699> don't<00:07:59.939> know<00:08:00.089> an<00:08:00.270> hour<00:08:00.449> so<00:08:00.839> we'll

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:00.990 
for I don't know an hour so we'll

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.300 
for I don't know an hour so we'll
probably<00:08:01.169> get<00:08:01.319> that<00:08:01.439> live<00:08:01.680> stream<00:08:01.889> going<00:08:02.129> or

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.310 
probably get that live stream going or

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.860 
probably get that live stream going or
if<00:08:02.460> it<00:08:02.580> gets<00:08:02.699> to<00:08:02.819> a<00:08:02.849> thousand<00:08:03.240> likes<00:08:03.389> before

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:03.870 
if it gets to a thousand likes before

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.889 
if it gets to a thousand likes before
that<00:08:04.110> then<00:08:04.889> maybe<00:08:05.669> we'll<00:08:05.939> get<00:08:06.270> it<00:08:06.419> started

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:06.899 
that then maybe we'll get it started

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:08.149 
that then maybe we'll get it started
