 hello very good to all how about how 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.980
 you are and welcome 6 to the channel 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.990
 youtube tai shan has captivated his insect 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.790
 can you find me on twitter for 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.180
 navas 10 and today I 'm going to talk about a 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.920
 universal application of ios ph l 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.989
 yesterday we talked about the same application 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.029
 but for mac that does pretty much what 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.710
 today we are going to do the analysis to 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.210
 this application of ios and if you want 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.460
 promoters if you want this application 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.960
 free because it's paid we have two 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.820
 promoters for you in the end os 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.350
 I explain this is an incognito we are going to 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.899
 get in the application to see what is 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.370
 very simple is a search engine but it is a 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.469
 vitamin finder because we can do 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.629
 searches where we want in 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.179
 any platform to fix that we're going to 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.289
 search for example noah wyle according 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.000
 in this case I will do the search 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.649
 in aysÃ©n a with punto net that is my 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 web page that the integrated we have not 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.649
 written the new web therefore not 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.199
 nothing appears but notice that here 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.539
 we have a menu with all these engines 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.159
 of search and we can use the 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.900
 that we want we can use for 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.900
 example google images not to search 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.310
 photographs of this actor not that is the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.260
 actor who made steve jobs in the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.790
 silicon valley pirates movie no 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.350
 very interesting in a very movie 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 good that I recommend you we can not 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.890
 search obviously in google 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 search for example in amazon in bing 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.650
 amazon would not make much sense but for 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.939
 example on youtube sure if 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.280
 we search on youtube we will find 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.409
 some coincidence fix here in the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.390
 the macworld when noah wyle invited 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.920
 steve jobs and this course was next to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.759
 him because it was in a keynote not the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.110
 truth is that it is a pretty video 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.399
 interesting and that I recommend you to see 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.080
 all of you well then nothing 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.030
 it is simply this but it has a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.890
 very interesting little thing we can add 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.299
 any search engine that here does not 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.190
 is integrated for example as you see 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.380
 here is healthy with net point does not come by 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.940
 I added it to add it 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.100
 you have to press on the button quoted this 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.780
 of the cloud with the least and the most and since 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.580
 here you give the button of more than 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.319
 is up on the left here you put 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.090
 Well, the search engine and the name 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.470
 that you want to give him not the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.000
 truth is that it is very simple if you want 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.710
 integrate the senna with dot net look here 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330
 we have it we give the little button of the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.950
 iv and note that here we have the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.390
 information that we have to put the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.360
 which you have to put up the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.209
 web address has ended in search bar 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.880
 bar and question mark equal to both 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.140
 hundred up and down then you put the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 name you want, I've put on stage 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.010
 with a net point, the truth is that it is very 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.110
 simple you can integrate any engine 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 search of a web page for 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.540
 look very quickly any 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.189
 coincident 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.439
 for example you want to look for a 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.209
 any application for example the one of 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.920
 plants against zombies because nothing we are going to 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.719
