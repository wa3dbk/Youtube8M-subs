00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 at dawn very well I'm delighted to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.040
 be here the truth that very very very 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.010
 happy and good and this for me is already a 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 I dream that is how long you have been 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.580
 fighting for this dream because I'm looking 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.270
 the first time I got on a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.160
 stage was with my mother five years 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.470
 I taught guitar and I 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 I loved then you also started in a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 television show in I see I see with 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.149
 teresa rabal yes I was there and from that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 moment then I there I already knew that I 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.230
 I wanted to be an artist but now I've 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 got a little bit because this song is going 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.020
 to ring now that it's called lele is a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.170
 mix like electronics and a little 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.510
 very Andalusian rumbero and the truth that the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.579
 people are liking it a lot and I 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 I bet a lot for that profit and the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.629
 reason to be here with this fund is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.530
 because I wish that one day, alba soler 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.370
 be among these great artists 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.489
 what happened here 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.239
 two reasons why you need to support 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.330
 the suns 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.460
 first because this canteen and we have 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.110
 that support our own because if not 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.390
 we can do what ours is going to do and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.729
 second because I insist the subject is going to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.780
 like and you will watch it a lot this year 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.229
