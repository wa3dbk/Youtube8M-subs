00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.830
 105 years ago a group of young people who were part of a team of friends of the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.150
 southern independence neighborhood joined in the plaza solÃ­s and thus founded the club 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.379
 bush 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.349
 days later I would add the word itself together to give you a 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.499
 English tone that reached something more prestigious north 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.749
 by those years the neighborhood of the mouth was mainly populated by 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.170
 Italian immigrants 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.290
 placid was leaning and there comes out the scene qualifier and I know what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.120
 port worker and mouth president in 1906 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.330
 and Albert a Swedish ship decided to use his flag as inspiration 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.950
 the yellow strip started being diagonal but as the families of the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.760
 players poetry in opposite directions the team seemed a 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.430
 cambalache was chosen to do the horizontal and thus avoid inconveniences 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.950
 in 1913 he got the promotion to the first division and since then he is one of the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.950
 four teams that never lost the category 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.570

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.830

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.280

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.000
