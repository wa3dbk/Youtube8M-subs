 who have problems with a certain type 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.759
 so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 types that are found are iron 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.409
 to have to fill your vehicle with 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 drug and then call the police that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.679
 it bothers a little load that he says that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.990
 he's never a snitch or anything for the century 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.689
 goes with the rules goes against the rules 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.159
 from the street but it depends says it's a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.659
 fiscal so there's not much problem 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.689
 we have to go do the springs according to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.689
 'the in beni but the real area is in the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.789
 hotel back off in the center of the center 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.359
 from santiago so we have to go up 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.549
 there this mission is not very complicated 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.939
 fact is simple we simply have 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.799

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.319
 and with the women that I am going to give you 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.750
 front it's going to be pretty easy 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.209
 pass this mission but good then 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.550
 let's go to the place that I eat 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.560
 I say again is at the hotel bank of 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.690
 well this mission is important because 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.370
 will help us unlock missions 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.600
 new non-gaming and non - being 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.670
 be secondary she gave me to the area and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.400
 this hotel where we have been 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.990
 with the valet service and we 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.590
 says the prosecutor is going to leave his car 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.950
 a taste in this hotel then for 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.350

 caution that the police do not follow us 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.520
 because if you have a star of 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.460
 search you will not be able to overcome the 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.810
 broadcast then before this mission 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.960
 free yourself from all the stars of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.480
 search if it does not bother the cops not 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.190
 run over nobody because you're going to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.630
 difficult to pass this mission 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.280
 secret nations yes you have a 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.380
 star search well we have to 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.950
 wait for this asshole to come out of 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.940
 vehicle 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.319
 and I left the car parked it will be a 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.230

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.360
 that is already going to leave the vehicle well going to 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.300

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 ropitas to change him 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.750
 we take the money 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.100
 and we're ready as valet 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.930
 we have to go to the area that is 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.020
 indicated 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.670
 well not exactly on radar but 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.280
 is with a yellow mark on the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.350
 radar and there 's the red mark is not 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.400
 saying we are the new kid 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.290
 in quotes of the place do not want new 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.700
 boy the new car brand you say the 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.030
 fiscal 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.180
 that was just coming out of the station 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.180
 of cop 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.900
 and will go to the hotel to leave your 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.599
 vehicle will surely be accommodated in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.620
 the hotel and all that stuff then 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:03.310
 we have to wait for it 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.840
 our our companions sometimes the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.000
 companions when this vehicle arrives 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.819
 are going to overtake which we have to 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.349
 do faster than them 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.349
 there comes another one that is not 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.519
 and let's hope the other guy catches 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.480
 vehicle and go in three we have to 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.730
 wait sometimes delay more delay less 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.860
 but hey, you just have to be a 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.129
 little patients and wait 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.770
 there are two vehicles I think is the one of 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.750
 the right 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.539
 so we have to be a little 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.539
 patients are not progressing 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.630
 and let's see if the other one either 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.990
 sources is not then is this one here 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.650
 ss from here and just the other tells us 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.380
 what if it is 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.000
 this asshole wants to win us but let's go 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.580
 move faster so we have to 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.440
 be also fast now we have a 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.960
 countdown timer 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.690
 we have to take the car to the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.090
 garage in daugherty we have to do it 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.550
 before time but that time that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.889
 we have here is so much to go to 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.930
 garage and both to return to the hotel 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.120
 so we have to be pretty fast 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.940
 and also quite careful 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.740
 from here to the garage we can touch 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.830
 everything you want if you can touch 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.690
 you can turn around if you want there's no 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.940
 no problem the detail is that when 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.250
 you return the car has to be simple 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.530
 impeccable you come to the red mark we are going to 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.350
 position ourselves so that the vehicle enters 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.130
 and the others deposit us let's start 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.130
 all the drug 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.459
 Well, it's already with the loading 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.969
 and we have to go again until the 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:51.159
 parking and now as I was telling you 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.049
 garage until what is the hotel until the 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.360
 parking we have to take care of the 

00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:58.929
 vehicle we do not have to let him 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.379
 nothing, we can not touch anything at all 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:05.619
 we have to be very careful because if 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:08.169
 we collide we have to go to network to 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:10.719
 repair the car and that is harmful 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.759
 because we are going to waste a lot of time and 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:16.389
 we would fail, we would fail the mission 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.769
 then take care of the vehicle if we have or 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.899
 already a little bit of time so if 

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:22.599
 you want it can be the little glasses for 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:24.939
 that gives us shocks with nothing that I 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.029
 take care of the vehicle is the red mark 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.919
 where we have to leave this car 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:32.469
 we have to leave it fast we have to 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.300
 go fast because another one comes right and 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.840
 okay the guy to pick up the vehicle 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.020
 of the fiscal 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.220
 Well, the car with all the drugs is already 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.010
 put we have to move quickly and 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.070
 go up what is the red mark and 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.460
 notify what the police is like 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.500
 I had planned it early to highlight 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.200
 calling him what is the cop 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.570
 and tells you everything that has happened 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.640
 what he has done not as a suspect and 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.910
 as guilty and all that you come to the 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.770
 police two cars patrol 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.889
 and they are going to make it out to this asshole 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.050
 of the vehicle 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:16.460
 they just do not know anything about the floor that is 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:19.580
 innocent and obviously they do not know anything and 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:23.389
 now they are going to look in what is the part 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:27.680
 back and everything you have found is 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:30.469
 a lot do not torment well then it 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.439
 has stopped this guy anyway and 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:35.660
 what he wanted tvn and why he came out 

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:37.070
 perfectly 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.990
 alright then there 's the inside the 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.410
 emission exceeded as you already know 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.920
 we ask does not give us any reward 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.690
 but good 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.790
 now missions have been unlocked 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.520
 secondary missions missions 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.080
 valet missions that will not 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.180
 analyze the game but if they help us 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.300
 reach 100% good I hope you draw the 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.460
