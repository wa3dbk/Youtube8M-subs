connect this and if you use booster
booster<00:05:15.980> tracks<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.790> then<00:05:17.360> continue<00:05:17.810> it

right into regular tracks without using
the<00:05:20.210> high-speed<00:05:20.630> rail<00:05:20.870> this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.040> what<00:05:22.220> happens

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
the high-speed rail this is what happens

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.600 
the high-speed rail this is what happens
the<00:05:24.200> cart<00:05:24.470> will<00:05:24.650> explode<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.310> take<00:05:25.460> the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
the booster tracks the high-speed rail

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.710 
the booster tracks the high-speed rail
and<00:05:31.130> then<00:05:31.550> go<00:05:31.670> back<00:05:31.880> into<00:05:31.940> normal<00:05:32.330> rail

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
and then go back into normal rail

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.350 
and then go back into normal rail
without<00:05:33.440> slowing<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:33.950> down<00:05:33.980> first<00:05:34.460> or<00:05:35.000> if<00:05:35.270> you
