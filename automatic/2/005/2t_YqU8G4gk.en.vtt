00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.460 

okay<00:00:03.070> show<00:00:03.460> it<00:00:03.520> together<00:00:04.080> so<00:00:05.080> this<00:00:05.230> is<00:00:05.350> our

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
okay show it together so this is our

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.839 
okay show it together so this is our
coronal<00:00:05.859> section<00:00:06.250> and<00:00:06.460> then<00:00:06.550> we<00:00:06.670> get<00:00:06.790> a

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:06.849 
coronal section and then we get a

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:21.450 
coronal section and then we get a
midsagittal<00:00:07.559> section<00:00:09.090> Salamis<00:00:10.090> here<00:00:20.280> it<00:00:21.280> came

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
midsagittal section Salamis here it came

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:31.109 
midsagittal section Salamis here it came
off<00:00:21.550> only<00:00:21.820> on<00:00:21.910> to<00:00:22.000> one<00:00:22.119> side<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.310> then<00:00:30.490> on<00:00:30.820> that

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
off only on to one side and then on that

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:42.840 
off only on to one side and then on that
ya<00:00:31.449> sagittal<00:00:31.990> view<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.829> see<00:00:42.219> if<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.339> can<00:00:42.429> find

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
ya sagittal view so see if you can find

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.309 
ya sagittal view so see if you can find
all<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.120> other<00:00:43.149> stuff<00:00:43.539> that<00:00:43.569> we<00:00:43.749> found<00:00:43.929> like<00:00:44.170> a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:44.319 
all the other stuff that we found like a

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:55.459 
all the other stuff that we found like a
lateral<00:00:44.499> ventricle<00:00:45.069> the<00:00:45.309> third<00:00:45.519> ventricle

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.719 

the<00:00:56.469> white<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:59.079> means<00:00:59.319> on<00:01:00.190> here<00:01:00.429> it's<00:01:00.549> right

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
the white which means on here it's right

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:08.430 
the white which means on here it's right
there<00:01:02.639> and<00:01:03.639> then<00:01:03.969> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:06.600> yep<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:08.380> that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
there and then I think yep and that

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.390 
there and then I think yep and that
darkness<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.190> there's<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> anterior<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
darkness and there's the anterior and

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.550 
darkness and there's the anterior and
then<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.640> think<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.330> don't<00:01:13.870> know<00:01:14.050> about<00:01:14.140> lateral

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
then I think I don't know about lateral

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.280 
then I think I don't know about lateral
ventricles<00:01:15.010> I<00:01:15.220> mean<00:01:15.690> see<00:01:16.690> if<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.870> I<00:01:16.900> think<00:01:17.020> you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
ventricles I mean see if you I think you

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.870 
ventricles I mean see if you I think you
can<00:01:17.440> pull<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.620> apart<00:01:17.740> we're<00:01:18.490> not<00:01:18.610> pulling

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
can pull it apart we're not pulling

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.510 
can pull it apart we're not pulling
apart<00:01:19.000> but<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:19.480> close<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.900> up<00:01:20.020> like<00:01:20.430> opening<00:01:21.430> it

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
apart but I close it up like opening it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.250 
apart but I close it up like opening it
but<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:26.940> start<00:01:27.940> again<00:01:28.090> okay<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.110> the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
but you start again okay so this is the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.970 
but you start again okay so this is the
coronal<00:01:29.710> section<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.340> one<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.090> grains

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
coronal section of one of the grains

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.520 
coronal section of one of the grains
these<00:01:32.980> are<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.190> lateral<00:01:33.490> ventricles<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:35.350> is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
these are the lateral ventricles this is

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.420 
these are the lateral ventricles this is
the<00:01:35.680> white<00:01:35.860> matter

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
the white matter

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.580 
the white matter
this<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.390> cortical<00:01:37.900> gray<00:01:38.110> matter<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.720> then

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
this is cortical gray matter and then

00:01:42.590 --> 00:02:00.340 
this is cortical gray matter and then
just<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.369> fornix<00:01:58.390> well<00:01:59.390> there's<00:01:59.569> one<00:01:59.750> I<00:01:59.990> think

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
just the fornix well there's one I think

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:18.910 
just the fornix well there's one I think
you<00:02:08.799> also<00:02:09.799> have<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.549> gyri<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.060> yeah<00:02:17.799> okay<00:02:18.799> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you also have the gyri and yeah okay a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.330 
you also have the gyri and yeah okay a
little<00:02:19.430> space<00:02:19.670> look<00:02:19.880> right<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:27.129> that's<00:02:28.129> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
little space look right here that's the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.000 
little space look right here that's the
lateral<00:02:28.730> venture
