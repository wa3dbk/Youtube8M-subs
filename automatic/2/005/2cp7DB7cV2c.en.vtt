over Europe and all over Asia and it
actually<00:04:01.540> helps<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.049> keep<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.230> flow<00:04:02.470> of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
actually helps to keep the flow of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.640 
actually helps to keep the flow of
traffic<00:04:02.799> moving<00:04:03.190> and<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.819> also<00:04:04.079> safer<00:04:05.819> but

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
traffic moving and it's also safer but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.250 
traffic moving and it's also safer but
it<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.370> has<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.579> very<00:04:09.910> bet<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.510> looks<00:04:10.989> bad

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
it is it has a very bet it looks bad

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.140 
it is it has a very bet it looks bad
because<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.799> looks<00:04:12.069> extremely<00:04:12.430> unsafe<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:18.150> Tom

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150
