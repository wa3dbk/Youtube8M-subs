dave<00:00:00.179> is<00:00:00.390> this<00:00:00.570> whole<00:00:00.750> flanking<00:00:01.380> attack<00:00:01.709> idea

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
dave is this whole flanking attack idea

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.700 
dave is this whole flanking attack idea
actually<00:00:02.909> that<00:00:03.419> barely<00:00:03.810> does<00:00:04.020> any<00:00:04.230> damaged<00:00:04.620> i

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
actually that barely does any damaged i

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.530 
actually that barely does any damaged i
think<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.009> seven<00:00:05.700> damage<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.450> our

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
think the seven damage to one of our

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.709 
think the seven damage to one of our
cavalry<00:00:06.930> troops<00:00:07.610> it<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.880> fluke<00:00:09.240> maybe<00:00:09.570> they

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
cavalry troops it was a fluke maybe they

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.140 
cavalry troops it was a fluke maybe they
were<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.170> higher<00:00:10.469> terrain<00:00:10.800> or<00:00:11.280> no<00:00:11.700> they

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
were just all higher terrain or no they

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.780 
were just all higher terrain or no they
weren't<00:00:12.830> by<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.889> way<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.400> thing<00:00:14.580> goes<00:00:14.759> down

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
weren't by the way that thing goes down

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.040 
weren't by the way that thing goes down
we<00:00:15.330> overwhelmed<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:16.350> our<00:00:16.590> numbers<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
we overwhelmed it with our numbers and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
we overwhelmed it with our numbers and
that's<00:00:19.050> sort<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.740> course<00:00:22.769> we

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that's sort of that and of course we

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.480 
that's sort of that and of course we
gained<00:00:23.279> experience<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.490> over

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
gained experience for that as well over

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.349 
gained experience for that as well over
here<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:26.820> see<00:00:27.060> Petroff<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.689> level<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.080> now

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
here let's see Petroff can level up now

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.900 
here let's see Petroff can level up now
just<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.570> point<00:00:30.779> will<00:00:31.109> over<00:00:31.349> up<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.910> actually

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
just one point will over up on actually

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.520 
just one point will over up on actually
yeah<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.329> also<00:00:33.690> starting<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
yeah we also starting to get to the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.750 
yeah we also starting to get to the
point<00:00:34.680> where<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.010> don't<00:00:35.160> really<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.460> too

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
point where we don't really have too

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
point where we don't really have too
much<00:00:35.969> stuff<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> level<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.260> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
much stuff to level up so I think we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.549 
much stuff to level up so I think we
just<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> XP<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.110> there<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
just do the XP one and there we go it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
just do the XP one and there we go it
looks<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.920> yeah<00:00:41.309> number<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> green

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
looks like yeah number for the green

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.770 
looks like yeah number for the green
people<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.260> been<00:00:43.379> eliminated<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.070> here

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
people have been eliminated over here

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.590 
people have been eliminated over here
which<00:00:45.780> leaves<00:00:46.079> us<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.680> yellow<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> were

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which leaves us with yellow and were

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.220 
which leaves us with yellow and were
yellowish<00:00:49.079> green<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.309> red

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.140

if<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.709> will<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:25.860> declare<00:02:26.280> war<00:02:26.489> on<00:02:26.550> them

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
if you will just declare war on them

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.920 
if you will just declare war on them
like<00:02:26.970> such<00:02:27.920> take<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.069> town<00:02:29.510> come<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.780> go

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
like such take the town come on to go

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.869 
like such take the town come on to go
down<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.349> go<00:02:32.540> take<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.690> out<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:35.870> then

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
down there we go take it out and then

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.839 
down there we go take it out and then
just<00:02:38.879> really<00:02:39.239> raise<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.810> place<00:02:40.849> because

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
just really raise this place because

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.190 
just really raise this place because
they<00:02:41.970> don't<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.239> much<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.569> out<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.080> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
they don't have much here out there and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
they don't have much here out there and
actually<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.099> just<00:02:44.129> raised<00:02:44.489> both<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually I think I just raised both of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
actually I think I just raised both of
these<00:02:45.030> towns<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.299> pretty<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:48.959> that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.400 

right<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.000> coming<00:03:13.300> from<00:03:13.390> here<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.959> think<00:03:14.290> we'll

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
right so coming from here I think we'll

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.650 
right so coming from here I think we'll
just<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:15.190> think<00:03:15.489> we'll<00:03:15.610> actually<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:16.150> end<00:03:16.420> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
just I think we'll actually just end the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.830 
just I think we'll actually just end the
series<00:03:16.959> for<00:03:17.349> this<00:03:17.470> let's<00:03:17.739> play<00:03:17.950> say<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.599> for

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
series for this let's play say here for

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.600 
series for this let's play say here for
now<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.290> perhaps<00:03:20.739> we'll<00:03:21.069> come<00:03:21.220> back<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
now and perhaps we'll come back in the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.900 
now and perhaps we'll come back in the
game<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> little<00:03:22.180> bit<00:03:22.390> but<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:24.610> at<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
game for a little bit but like at the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330 
game for a little bit but like at the
current<00:03:25.239> state<00:03:25.599> I<00:03:25.629> feel<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.310> currently<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
current state I feel like currently I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.300 
current state I feel like currently I
mean<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.810> think<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:29.680> there<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.040> is

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
mean I think that all there really is

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.869 
mean I think that all there really is
love<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:32.290> really<00:03:32.709> bodos<00:03:33.459> the

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
love to do is to just really bodos the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.089 
love to do is to just really bodos the
Red<00:03:34.060> Faction<00:03:34.299> over<00:03:34.720> here<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.200> we've<00:03:35.920> already

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
Red Faction over here and we've already

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.180 
Red Faction over here and we've already
seen<00:03:36.400> someone<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.920> units<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:38.980> they

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
seen someone the the units that they

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.250 
seen someone the the units that they
have<00:03:39.430> were<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.360> holes<00:03:40.599> with<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.959> chassé

have were the the holes with a chassé

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.720 
have were the the holes with a chassé
ease<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.590> units<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:41.920> they<00:03:42.129> can<00:03:42.280> build<00:03:42.489> off<00:03:42.670> of
