00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
going to use nail clippers because it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.420 
going to use nail clippers because it
goes<00:02:20.870> closer<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.770> shape<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.160> your<00:02:22.190> nail

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
goes closer with the shape of your nail

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.570 
goes closer with the shape of your nail
and<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.630> just<00:02:23.780> find<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.080> easier<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.680> way<00:02:27.580> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and I just find it easier that way and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.870 
and I just find it easier that way and
most<00:02:28.970> people<00:02:29.090> would<00:02:29.840> stop<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.610> just

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
most people would stop there and just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.900 
most people would stop there and just
put<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> top<00:02:32.450> coat<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.370> wanted<00:02:34.760> them

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
put a top coat on that but I wanted them

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.610 
put a top coat on that but I wanted them
feathers<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.810> thicker<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.500> would<00:02:36.590> have

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
feathers to be thicker so you would have

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.860 
feathers to be thicker so you would have
more<00:02:36.860> texture<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.450> gives<00:02:38.750> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
more texture on it and it just gives it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.790 
more texture on it and it just gives it
a<00:02:39.020> cooler<00:02:39.260> effect<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:41.320> just<00:02:42.320> put<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.650> on

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
a cooler effect so I just put it on

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.949 
a cooler effect so I just put it on
Milan<00:02:43.430> ease<00:02:43.690> clear<00:02:44.690> topcoat<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:49.810> after<00:02:50.810> where

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
Milan ease clear topcoat and after where

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.800 
Milan ease clear topcoat and after where
you<00:02:51.080> put<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.470> top<00:02:51.680> coat<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:53.209> do<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> same

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
you put on the top coat you do the same

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.330 
you put on the top coat you do the same
thing<00:02:54.110> as<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.380> did<00:02:54.530> before<00:02:54.680> with<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.190> base

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
thing as you did before with the base

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.410 
thing as you did before with the base
coat<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:57.380> this<00:02:57.769> time<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.340> make<00:02:58.910> sure<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.209> put<00:02:59.390> a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
coat but this time I make sure you put a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.000 
coat but this time I make sure you put a
lot<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.720> because<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.380> feather<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.769> going<00:03:00.950> to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
lot on because the feather is going to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.850 
lot on because the feather is going to
soak<00:03:01.280> some<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.880> up<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.110> creases

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.450 

and<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.670> put<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.180> feather<00:03:08.890> same<00:03:09.890> way<00:03:10.070> put

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
and just put the feather same way put

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.910 
and just put the feather same way put
the<00:03:10.610> other<00:03:10.730> one<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.380> make<00:03:12.380> sure<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.710> like

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the other one and make sure it's like

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.410 
the other one and make sure it's like
the<00:03:13.070> same<00:03:13.280> design<00:03:13.610> or<00:03:13.790> else<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.090> might<00:03:14.210> look

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
the same design or else it might look

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.920 
the same design or else it might look
weird<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:18.290> just<00:03:18.800> hold<00:03:18.980> down<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.310> sides<00:03:19.930> girls

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
weird and just hold down the sides girls

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.090 
weird and just hold down the sides girls
sleep<00:03:21.140> good<00:03:21.380> fall<00:03:21.590> off

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.120 

and<00:03:27.280> once<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.940> have<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:28.840> cut

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.300 

feather<00:03:33.130> till<00:03:34.030> your<00:03:34.210> nail<00:03:34.420> shape<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.680> your

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
feather till your nail shape and your

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.270 
feather till your nail shape and your
nose<00:03:36.460> should<00:03:36.790> look<00:03:36.970> like<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.710> feather<00:03:38.710> nail<00:03:39.010> or

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
nose should look like a feather nail or

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.210 
nose should look like a feather nail or
designed<00:03:39.850> at<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> very<00:03:40.360> end<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.770> just<00:03:41.770> put<00:03:41.980> a

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
designed at the very end I just put a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.330 
designed at the very end I just put a
top<00:03:42.670> coat<00:03:42.910> on<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.300> sometimes<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.080> feather

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
top coat on and sometimes the feather

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.500 
top coat on and sometimes the feather
the<00:03:45.340> little<00:03:45.580> strings<00:03:45.880> will<00:03:46.060> go<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.330> wrong<00:03:46.450> way

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the little strings will go the wrong way

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.180 
the little strings will go the wrong way
so<00:03:46.960> paint<00:03:47.320> your<00:03:47.440> nail<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.740> other<00:03:47.920> way

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
so paint your nail the other way

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.070 
so paint your nail the other way
direction<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:50.410> should<00:03:50.590> be<00:03:50.770> all<00:03:51.010> good<00:03:51.070> and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
direction and it should be all good and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.210 
direction and it should be all good and
then<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.110> should<00:03:53.380> have<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.590> really<00:03:53.980> cool

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
then you should have a really cool

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.360 
then you should have a really cool
feather<00:03:54.700> nail<00:03:55.000> design<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.890> that's<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.360> thanks
