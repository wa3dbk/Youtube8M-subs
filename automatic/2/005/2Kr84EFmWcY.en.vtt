other time in history hi I'm Sarah lamb
and<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.269> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> talk<00:00:30.599> about<00:00:30.630> silk<00:00:31.140> today

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.280 

you

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.040 

I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> start<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> silk<00:00:48.300> Bombyx

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I'm going to start with a silk Bombyx

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.280 
I'm going to start with a silk Bombyx
brick<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> mostly<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.080> it's<00:00:52.080> a

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
brick and mostly because it's it's a

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.920 
brick and mostly because it's it's a
preparation<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.780> more

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
preparation that is a little bit more

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.230 
preparation that is a little bit more
difficult<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.380> spin<00:00:55.680> than<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.040> top<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.700> but<00:00:57.120> if

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
difficult to spin than the top so but if

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000 
difficult to spin than the top so but if
you<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.510> come<00:00:57.690> across<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.200> they're<00:00:58.410> beautiful

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you do come across one they're beautiful

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340 
you do come across one they're beautiful
once<00:00:59.490> you<00:00:59.700> unfold<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:01.200> are

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
once you unfold them they are

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
once you unfold them they are
permanently<00:01:01.800> unfolded<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.670> never<00:01:02.850> get

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
permanently unfolded you can never get

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.479 
permanently unfolded you can never get
them<00:01:03.239> back<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:03.660> their<00:01:03.930> former<00:01:04.260> shape<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> as

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
them back into their former shape and as

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
them back into their former shape and as
I<00:01:05.790> work<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.780> fiber<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.650> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I work with the fiber you can see that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.870 
I work with the fiber you can see that
it's<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.370> wide<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.810> aligned<00:01:10.520> series<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> silk

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's a wide but aligned series of silk

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's a wide but aligned series of silk
fibers<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> step<00:01:14.370> in<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
fibers one of the this is a step in the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.180 
fibers one of the this is a step in the
process<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> industrial<00:01:15.840> production<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
process of industrial production but it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.960 
process of industrial production but it
is<00:01:17.840> not<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.170> final<00:01:19.530> step<00:01:19.770> before<00:01:19.970> industrial

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is not the final step before industrial

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.810 
is not the final step before industrial
spinning<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.250> variety<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
spinning so there are a variety of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
spinning so there are a variety of
lengths<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> fibers<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.080> which

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
lengths of fibers in here which

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.020 
lengths of fibers in here which
sometimes<00:01:25.680> makes<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.880> more

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
sometimes makes it a little bit more

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450 
sometimes makes it a little bit more
difficult<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> spin<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.740> spin<00:01:29.100> from

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
difficult to spin and if you spin from

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
difficult to spin and if you spin from
the<00:01:29.610> end<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.170> fiber<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.800> hold<00:01:32.130> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the end it's a lot of fiber to hold in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.870 
the end it's a lot of fiber to hold in
your<00:01:32.280> hand<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.970> ends<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.660> mess<00:01:34.080> so

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
your hand and it ends up as a mess so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.490 
your hand and it ends up as a mess so
when<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.910> learned<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.330> spin<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.050> mentioned

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
when I learned to spin as I mentioned

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.609 
when I learned to spin as I mentioned
before<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:38.490> were<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:39.330> books<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.500> of

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
before there were two books and one of

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.980 
before there were two books and one of
them<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:41.070> Patricia<00:01:41.610> Baines<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.210> she

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
them was Patricia Baines and she

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.859 
them was Patricia Baines and she
suggested<00:01:43.619> taking<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.720> preparation<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
suggested taking the preparation and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
suggested taking the preparation and
breaking<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.410> down<00:01:46.440> into<00:01:46.619> smaller<00:01:47.160> bits<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
breaking it down into smaller bits and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
breaking it down into smaller bits and
then<00:01:48.360> spinning<00:01:48.690> off<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.930> fold<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.710> how

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
then spinning off the fold so that's how

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.360 
then spinning off the fold so that's how
I<00:01:49.920> started<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.640> always<00:01:51.180> begin<00:01:51.930> fiber<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.190> fiber

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
I started I always begin fiber to fiber

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.810 
I started I always begin fiber to fiber
if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.300> try<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.960> fibers<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:56.130> pre<00:01:56.430> spun

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
if you try to put fibers on to pre spun

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.719 
if you try to put fibers on to pre spun
silk<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.229> slide<00:01:58.470> off<00:01:58.650> because<00:01:59.190> as<00:01:59.580> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
silk they just slide off because as I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.160 
silk they just slide off because as I
said<00:01:59.790> before<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.360> silk<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.900> slippery

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
said before the silk is really slippery

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
said before the silk is really slippery
slippery<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.220> has<00:02:03.210> no<00:02:03.810> crimp<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:07.700> scales<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
slippery and has no crimp or scales to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.509 
slippery and has no crimp or scales to
catch<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.019> fibers<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
catch on the other fibers so but the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.860 
catch on the other fibers so but the
fibers<00:02:11.850> will<00:02:12.000> catch<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:12.510> well<00:02:12.660> together

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
fibers will catch really well together

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.979 
fibers will catch really well together
so<00:02:13.799> just<00:02:13.830> add<00:02:14.400> fiber<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> fiber<00:02:15.330> whenever<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
so just add fiber to fiber whenever you
