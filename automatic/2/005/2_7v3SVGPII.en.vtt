00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
happened since I've got back into the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.200 
happened since I've got back into the
country<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> didn't<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> was<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
country I didn't think it was going to

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.930 
country I didn't think it was going to
be<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> bad<00:00:34.430> especially<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.550> people<00:00:35.670> can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
be this bad especially as people can

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.340 
be this bad especially as people can
probably<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.360> now<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> story

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
probably see now my side of the story

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
probably see now my side of the story
which<00:00:37.530> came<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.890> um<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.460> morning<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.450> didn't

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
which came out um this morning I didn't

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.750 
which came out um this morning I didn't
feel<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.620> I've<00:00:40.739> done<00:00:40.890> anything<00:00:41.040> wrong<00:00:41.489> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
feel that I've done anything wrong in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
feel that I've done anything wrong in
hindsight<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.570> probably<00:00:42.690> look<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
hindsight it would probably look at it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
hindsight it would probably look at it
maybe<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.579> story<00:00:44.850> did<00:00:45.450> break<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
maybe when the story did break the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
maybe when the story did break the
initial<00:00:46.860> story<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:48.149> Michael<00:00:48.539> Vaughn

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
initial story about about Michael Vaughn

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
initial story about about Michael Vaughn
maybe<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.710> should've<00:00:49.950> jumped<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> plane<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
maybe I should've jumped in a plane then

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.790 
maybe I should've jumped in a plane then
but<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> knew<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> wasn't<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> case<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
but I knew that that wasn't the case I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.229 
but I knew that that wasn't the case I
knew<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> wasn't<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:53.910> talking

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
knew that that wasn't what I was talking

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.619 
knew that that wasn't what I was talking
to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.660> ECB<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.059> yeah<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.270> thought

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to the ECB about so yeah I just thought

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.979 
to the ECB about so yeah I just thought
that<00:00:58.140> I'd<00:00:58.649> continue<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.750> when<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> came

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that I'd continue and then when I came

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
that I'd continue and then when I came
home<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:01.890> hurt<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.430> what's<00:01:02.609> happened
