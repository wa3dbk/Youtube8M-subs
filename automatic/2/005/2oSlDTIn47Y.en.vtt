to get a kill in the crucible rather

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.950 
to get a kill in the crucible rather
than<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:50.090> hallelujah<00:01:51.090> moving

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
than the two it is now hallelujah moving

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
than the two it is now hallelujah moving
on<00:01:52.079> let's<00:01:52.290> talk<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.100> last<00:01:53.310> word<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
on let's talk about the last word and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
on let's talk about the last word and
the<00:01:54.000> changes<00:01:54.450> for<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> weapon<00:01:55.259> are<00:01:55.560> reduce

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the changes for this weapon are reduce

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.810 
the changes for this weapon are reduce
the<00:01:56.340> range<00:01:56.579> step<00:01:57.000> from<00:01:57.299> 2210<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.579> reduce<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the range step from 2210 and reduce the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.410 
the range step from 2210 and reduce the
stability<00:02:00.420> staff<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.350> 20<00:02:01.799> from<00:02:02.369> 30<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.180> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
stability staff to 20 from 30 so this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.109 
stability staff to 20 from 30 so this
weapon<00:02:03.899> won't<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.860> range<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.430> does<00:02:05.759> now

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
weapon won't have the range it does now

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.510 
weapon won't have the range it does now
the<00:02:06.719> effective<00:02:07.229> range<00:02:07.500> will<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.829> reduced<00:02:08.340> when

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the effective range will be reduced when

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.089 
the effective range will be reduced when
I'm<00:02:08.789> aiming<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.390> site<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> there<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:10.979> be

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I'm aiming down site and there will be

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.559 
I'm aiming down site and there will be
an<00:02:11.310> increase<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.849> accuracy

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
an increase to accuracy

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.809 
an increase to accuracy
and<00:02:12.749> precision<00:02:13.349> damage<00:02:13.650> when<00:02:14.040> fired<00:02:14.370> from<00:02:14.670> the

made for hip firing and on top of all of

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.360 
made for hip firing and on top of all of
those<00:02:20.879> changes<00:02:21.510> fix<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.170> bog<00:02:22.409> where<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.129> hip
