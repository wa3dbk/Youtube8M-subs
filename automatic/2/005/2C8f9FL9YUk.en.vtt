00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this is dr. Terry Mason yes in the film

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.689 
this is dr. Terry Mason yes in the film
and<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.730> love<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.630> talk<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.279> where<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and I love what you talk about where the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.599 
and I love what you talk about where the
circulation<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.199> blocked<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> heart

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
circulation that is blocked in the heart

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.320 
circulation that is blocked in the heart
yeah<00:00:21.390> yeah<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.109> also<00:00:22.439> blocked<00:00:23.430> elsewhere

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
yeah yeah it's also blocked elsewhere

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.720 
yeah yeah it's also blocked elsewhere
the<00:00:24.660> body<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.380> connected<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.490> have

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the body is all connected if you have

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000 
the body is all connected if you have
vascular<00:00:27.330> disease<00:00:27.750> anywhere<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
vascular disease anywhere you have it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.529 
vascular disease anywhere you have it
everywhere<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.699> particular<00:00:29.970> interest

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
everywhere in this particular interest

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
everywhere in this particular interest
we<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:30.720> talking<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> penis<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.420> he

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
we were talking about the penis so he

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
we were talking about the penis so he
said<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> penis<00:00:34.079> erectile<00:00:34.800> dysfunction<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
said the penis erectile dysfunction is

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.740 
said the penis erectile dysfunction is
actually<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.070> clinical<00:00:38.070> indicator<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
actually the first clinical indicator of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
actually the first clinical indicator of
generalizing<00:00:39.829> cardiovascular<00:00:40.829> disease<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
generalizing cardiovascular disease it's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
generalizing cardiovascular disease it's
the<00:00:41.969> canary<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> coal<00:00:42.989> mine<00:00:43.129> because

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the canary in the coal mine because

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.970 
the canary in the coal mine because
inside<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.360> penis<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> highest

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
inside the penis you have the highest

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.630 
inside the penis you have the highest
per<00:00:47.690> cross-sectional<00:00:48.690> area<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.640> endothelial

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
cells and endothelial cells are what are

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.319 
cells and endothelial cells are what are
responsible<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.250> initiation<00:00:56.670> of

responsible for the initiation of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
responsible for the initiation of
increased<00:00:57.899> blood<00:00:58.109> flow<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.800> create<00:00:59.760> an

the flag I called and the diseases that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060 
the flag I called and the diseases that
damage<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.090> endothelial<00:01:06.479> cells<00:01:07.320> were

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
damage the endothelial cells were

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
damage the endothelial cells were

arteries<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.119> penis<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.110> these<00:01:40.259> men

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
arteries to the penis right so these men

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.780 
arteries to the penis right so these men
that<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.159> manly<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.640> also

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
blood flow same mechanism except it's a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.190 
blood flow same mechanism except it's a
lot<00:01:50.040> smaller<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> clitoris<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.840> a

lot smaller you know the clitoris is a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100 
lot smaller you know the clitoris is a
miniature<00:01:53.070> penis<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.820> gets<00:01:54.390> engorged<00:01:54.960> with

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
miniature penis it gets engorged with

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.490 
miniature penis it gets engorged with
blood<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.799> arousal<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.899> if<00:01:57.899> those<00:01:58.110> arteries

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
blood with arousal and if those arteries

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.359 
blood with arousal and if those arteries
are<00:01:58.829> blocked<00:02:00.079> nothing<00:02:01.079> happens<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:02.159> your
