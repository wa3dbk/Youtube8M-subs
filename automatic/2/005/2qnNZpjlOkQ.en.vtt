00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
in my opinion that there's blatantly a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
in my opinion that there's blatantly a
deliberate<00:00:40.350> crash<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:41.370> Cavendish<00:00:42.239> didn't

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
deliberate crash just Cavendish didn't

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.990 
deliberate crash just Cavendish didn't
hold<00:00:42.719> his<00:00:42.840> line<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:44.070> getting<00:00:44.370> loose<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
hold his line just getting loose and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
hold his line just getting loose and
couldn't<00:00:45.989> hack<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> grapple<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.190> gonna

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
couldn't hack the grapple was gonna

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
couldn't hack the grapple was gonna
 kick<00:00:47.879> his<00:00:48.000> ass<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.420> sprint<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
 kick his ass in a sprint and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.299 
 kick his ass in a sprint and
just<00:00:49.980> dissing<00:00:50.370> some<00:00:51.360> dodgy<00:00:52.289> dangerous<00:00:52.920> riding

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just dissing some dodgy dangerous riding

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.090

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
from this one but in my opinion bad move

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
from this one but in my opinion bad move
by<00:00:58.739> Cavendish<00:00:59.280> for<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> professional<00:01:00.719> sprinter
