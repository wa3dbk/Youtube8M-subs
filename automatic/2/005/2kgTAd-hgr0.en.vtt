but<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.610> close<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.180> cost<00:00:57.449> $13

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
but this was so close in cost $13

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
but this was so close in cost $13
compared<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> $8<00:00:59.399> that<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> decided<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> go

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
compared to $8 that I decided to go

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
compared to $8 that I decided to go
ahead<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> buy<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> didn't<00:01:02.039> think

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
ahead and buy it because I didn't think

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
ahead and buy it because I didn't think
it<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.930> worth<00:01:03.930> saving<00:01:04.470> 5<00:01:04.680> bucks<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.220> ahead

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it was worth saving 5 bucks to go ahead

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.429 
it was worth saving 5 bucks to go ahead
and<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> takes<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.020> little

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and make one because it takes a little

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.370 
and make one because it takes a little
bit<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> effort<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.810> wasn't<00:01:10.350> enough

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
bit of effort and it just wasn't enough

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.750 
bit of effort and it just wasn't enough
savings<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.070> me<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> went<00:01:11.520> ahead<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
savings for me so I went ahead and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
savings for me so I went ahead and
bought<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.150> now<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> model<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
bought this one now this is a model that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.770 
bought this one now this is a model that
has<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> magnification<00:01:14.880> lens<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
has a magnification lens in it as you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.560 
has a magnification lens in it as you
can<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> magnifying<00:01:17.009> glass<00:01:17.570> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
can see there a magnifying glass it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
can see there a magnifying glass it's
not<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> diopter<00:01:19.229> meaning<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> can't<00:01:20.159> adjust

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
not a diopter meaning you can't adjust

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.080 
not a diopter meaning you can't adjust
the<00:01:21.299> focus<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.409> fixed<00:01:22.740> focus<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.640> was

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the focus on that it's fixed focus I was

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.249 
the focus on that it's fixed focus I was
a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.330> worried<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
a little worried at first because I do

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.749 
a little worried at first because I do
wear<00:01:25.470> glasses<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> thought<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> might<00:01:26.580> need

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
wear glasses and I thought I might need

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.240 
wear glasses and I thought I might need
a<00:01:26.820> diopter<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.840> didn't<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.979> nearsighted

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a diopter but I didn't I'm nearsighted

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.109 
a diopter but I didn't I'm nearsighted
that<00:01:30.150> fortunately<00:01:30.829> worked<00:01:31.829> him<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.850> favor

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that fortunately worked him in my favor

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.840 
that fortunately worked him in my favor
so<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:34.500> went<00:01:34.710> ahead<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.009> bought<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so I went ahead and bought this and it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.350

as<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.939> viewfinder<00:01:48.149> too

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
as you can see there the viewfinder too

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.940 
as you can see there the viewfinder too
but<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> didn't<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.680> idea

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
but I didn't really like this idea

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
but I didn't really like this idea
because<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:51.350> did<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.530> want<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.610> stuck

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
because I did not want this to be stuck

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
because I did not want this to be stuck
to<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.509> camera<00:01:54.869> since<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.070> have

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to the back of my camera since I do have

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.539 
to the back of my camera since I do have
an<00:01:56.430> articulating<00:01:57.360> LCD<00:01:58.290> screen<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> the

an articulating LCD screen here on the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.959 
an articulating LCD screen here on the
back<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:01.200> often<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
back that I use often I really like that

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.539 
back that I use often I really like that
feature<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.600> reason<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> bought<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.259> camera

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
feature one reason I bought this camera

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
feature one reason I bought this camera
and<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> were<00:02:06.060> attached<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.530> tripod

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and if this were attached to the tripod

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
and if this were attached to the tripod
thread<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> bottom<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.000> into<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> back

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
thread on the bottom and into the back

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.930 
thread on the bottom and into the back
here<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.110> would<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.039> able<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> lift<00:02:11.520> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
here I would not be able to lift my

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
here I would not be able to lift my
screen<00:02:12.440> which

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
screen which

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
screen which
I think<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> dumb<00:02:14.790> idea<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> went<00:02:15.780> ahead

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I think is a dumb idea so I went ahead

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.289 
I think is a dumb idea so I went ahead
and<00:02:15.989> just<00:02:16.170> disposed<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.489> idea<00:02:17.849> entirely

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
and just disposed of this idea entirely

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.570 
and just disposed of this idea entirely
and<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.590> went<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.980> different<00:02:20.159> route<00:02:20.519> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and what it went a different route to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.509 
and what it went a different route to
attach<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.239> camera<00:02:22.010> my<00:02:23.010> first<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.400> I

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
attach it to my camera my first thing I

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.119 
attach it to my camera my first thing I
did<00:02:23.580> was<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.840> some<00:02:25.019> ridges<00:02:25.470> here<00:02:25.500> or

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
did was there are some ridges here or

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.339 
did was there are some ridges here or
some<00:02:26.310> bumps<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.150> back<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:28.019> allow<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.319> to

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
some bumps on the back that allow it to

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.020 
some bumps on the back that allow it to
fit<00:02:28.739> into<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.190> frame<00:02:29.519> as<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.879> see

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
fit into this frame as you can see

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
fit into this frame as you can see
there's<00:02:30.180> some<00:02:30.360> notches<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:30.989> you're<00:02:31.860> going

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
there's some notches there you're going

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520 
there's some notches there you're going
to<00:02:32.220> need<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.180> level<00:02:33.480> those<00:02:33.750> off<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.290> at

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
to need to level those off because at

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.740 
to need to level those off because at
first<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.950> didn't<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.849> they<00:02:36.329> ended<00:02:36.569> up

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
first I didn't do that and they ended up

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.229 
first I didn't do that and they ended up
creating<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.920> mark<00:02:38.190> on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.489> back<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.760> my<00:02:38.849> LCD

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
creating a mark on the back of my LCD

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.470 
creating a mark on the back of my LCD
screen<00:02:39.659> where<00:02:40.349> those<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.829> raised<00:02:41.640> ridges

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
screen where those little raised ridges

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360 
screen where those little raised ridges
were<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> didn't<00:02:43.260> really<00:02:43.769> care<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
were I didn't really care for that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.130 
were I didn't really care for that
fortunately<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> came<00:02:45.209> off<00:02:45.390> after<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.840> cleaned

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
fortunately it came off after I cleaned

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.800 
fortunately it came off after I cleaned
it<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.560> didn't<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.430> that<00:02:47.640> idea<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.569> took

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it but didn't like that idea so I took

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.089 
it but didn't like that idea so I took
care<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.319> second<00:02:49.590> thing<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.829> had<00:02:49.980> to

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
care of that the second thing I had to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.369 
care of that the second thing I had to
do<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.700> create<00:02:51.480> some<00:02:51.660> kind<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> padding<00:02:52.319> on

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
do was create some kind of padding on

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.930 
do was create some kind of padding on
the<00:02:52.440> back<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:52.980> since<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.459> was<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.790> going

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
the back here since this was not going

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.170 
the back here since this was not going
to<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.120> sticking<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.870> frame<00:02:55.170> anymore<00:02:55.709> I

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
to be sticking to this frame anymore I

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.550 
to be sticking to this frame anymore I
was<00:02:57.180> touching<00:02:57.569> my<00:02:57.690> LCD<00:02:58.019> screen<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.349> didn't

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
was touching my LCD screen I didn't

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.240 
was touching my LCD screen I didn't
wanted<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:59.299> abuse<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.079> took<00:03:01.470> some<00:03:01.799> fuzzy

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
wanted to abuse it so I took some fuzzy

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.180 
wanted to abuse it so I took some fuzzy
velcro<00:03:02.730> sofa<00:03:03.120> adhesive-backed<00:03:03.769> fuzzy<00:03:04.769> velcro

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
velcro sofa adhesive-backed fuzzy velcro

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.520 
velcro sofa adhesive-backed fuzzy velcro
like<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.019> cut<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.290> really<00:03:07.409> thin

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
like this and I just cut it really thin

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.649 
like this and I just cut it really thin
with<00:03:07.890> some<00:03:08.069> scissors<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.790> put<00:03:09.329> it<00:03:09.420> along<00:03:09.629> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
with some scissors and put it along the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.360 
with some scissors and put it along the
edge<00:03:09.900> right<00:03:10.200> here<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:10.799> there's<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> soft

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
edge right here so now there's a soft

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.030 
edge right here so now there's a soft
edge<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.329> can<00:03:12.359> just<00:03:12.629> put<00:03:12.900> right<00:03:13.260> onto<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:13.500> camera

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
edge I can just put right onto my camera

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.910 
edge I can just put right onto my camera
now<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:15.569> next<00:03:15.900> problem<00:03:16.140> was<00:03:16.530> well<00:03:16.650> how<00:03:16.739> do<00:03:16.799> I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
now the next problem was well how do I

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.550 
now the next problem was well how do I
attach<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.790> my<00:03:17.819> LCD<00:03:18.239> screen<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:19.380> what<00:03:19.530> I

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
attach it to my LCD screen but what I

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.699 
attach it to my LCD screen but what I
did<00:03:20.069> was<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.609> took<00:03:20.639> crota<00:03:21.569> flicks<00:03:21.900> ideas<00:03:22.440> and

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
did was I took crota flicks ideas and

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.360 
did was I took crota flicks ideas and
see<00:03:23.090> put<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> video<00:03:24.269> out<00:03:24.419> using<00:03:24.930> an<00:03:25.739> identical

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
see put a video out using an identical

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.879 
see put a video out using an identical
viewfinder<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.329> believe<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.989> he<00:03:28.109> had<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.470> put

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
viewfinder I believe and he had some put

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.190 
viewfinder I believe and he had some put
some<00:03:29.040> velcro<00:03:29.510> actually<00:03:30.510> right<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.810> center

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
some velcro actually right in the center

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.050 
some velcro actually right in the center
here<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.680> both<00:03:32.190> sides<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:32.819> run<00:03:32.970> another

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
velcro strip around the screen well I

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.670

had a slightly different scenario

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.300 
had a slightly different scenario
because<00:03:38.629> you<00:03:39.629> can<00:03:39.780> see<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.319> my<00:03:40.530> velcro<00:03:40.799> screen

because you can see on my velcro screen
here<00:03:41.579> there<00:03:42.209> isn't<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.599> single<00:03:43.260> passage

through the middle you can run the
velcro<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.690> two<00:03:45.900> slots<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.160> had<00:03:47.639> to<00:03:47.730> do
