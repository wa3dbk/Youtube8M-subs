00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi guys and welcome to science for 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.960
 fun but now make yourself comfortable because 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.790
 this is a bottle of beer and inside 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.599
 self hides a physical phenomenon 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 spectacular 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 look at this joke here, yes 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.980
 called ping ping and destroyed 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 many friendships just hit the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.850
 neck of a glass bottle full of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 beer to generate this eruption of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 foam the real reason why everything 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510
 this happens was clarified only at the end 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.340
 2013 when the publication of a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 scientific research has finally done 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 clarity on one of the worst tricks from 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 part of forever 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.079
 but let's start with her nice beer than of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 fact is a solution in which it is dissolved 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 a large amount of anhydride 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 carbonic when we open the bottle 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 carbon dioxide tends to separate 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 spontaneously from the liquid and for this 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.539
 we see all these little bubbles 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 that rise to the top this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.460
 separation continues gradually unless 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.360
 that someone does not hit the neck of the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.670
 your bottle 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 already because at that moment they are generated 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.690
 instantly of the waves of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.700
 expansion compression flowing 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 back and forth along the bottle e 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.869
 they are transferred to the beer itself 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.119
 creating pressure variations 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 which expand and contract bubbles 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.619
 in the liquid these sudden fools 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.390
 they collapse the bubbles inside 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 of beer fragmenting into 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.860
 even smaller daughter bubbles on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 volume of the parent bubbles is distributed 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.790
 then in these little clouds of bubbles 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.680
 daughters who, however, have greater 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 surface in contact with the liquid e 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.329
 they can easily absorb the anhydride 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.700
 carbon dioxide surrounding the bubbles yes 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.710
 they swell and rise upwards and it is 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.960
 just going up they meet another 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 carbon dioxide to grow yes 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.259
 creates a floating foam that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.149
 suddenly comes out of the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.100
 bottle if we looked at this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.110
 almost immediate phenomenon with one 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.020
 high speed camera we could 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.579
 note that these clusters of bubbles 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.619
 go back upwards creating 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 mushroom shapes typical of large ones 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.670
 explosions you may not believe but 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.979
 as studied in this small 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 beer bottle lays the foundation for the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.610
 understanding of great phenomena 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.689
 potentially very geological 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 dangerous 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.649
 now and time of the summer break but 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.730
 quiet we see you September and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.080
 always here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080
 su science for fun
