00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
what about statin safety side effects

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.899 
what about statin safety side effects
right<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.450> thought<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.640> statins<00:01:17.640> have

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
right they thought of that statins have

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.950 
right they thought of that statins have
a<00:01:18.180> favorable<00:01:19.140> risk<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.189> benefit<00:01:20.970> -<00:01:21.090> risk<00:01:21.360> ratio

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
a favorable risk to benefit - risk ratio

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
a favorable risk to benefit - risk ratio
with<00:01:22.560> only<00:01:22.770> rare<00:01:23.100> adverse<00:01:23.640> effects<00:01:24.060> reported

yeah<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.540> statins<00:01:28.409> are<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.710> made<00:01:28.890> more

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
yeah if statins are to be made more

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
yeah if statins are to be made more

concern<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.140> look<00:01:34.950> we're<00:01:35.159> talking<00:01:35.640> about

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
concern but look we're talking about

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.280

cheese and a milkshake right surely we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
cheese and a milkshake right surely we
can<00:01:39.990> conclude<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.650> documented<00:01:41.280> safety

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
can conclude that the documented safety

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
can conclude that the documented safety
record<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> statins<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.950> substantially

record of statins is substantially

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.060 
record of statins is substantially
better<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> fast<00:01:45.479> food<00:01:46.070> they

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
better than that of fast food they

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.270 
better than that of fast food they
conclude<00:01:47.810> we<00:01:48.810> envisage<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.470> future<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.250> which

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
conclude we envisage a future in which

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.359 
conclude we envisage a future in which
fast<00:01:50.759> food<00:01:50.970> restaurants<00:01:51.450> encourage<00:01:51.810> a
