00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
other things as well but usually it's

down to these three things first one of

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.120 
down to these three things first one of
these<00:05:20.590> is<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.979> job<00:05:21.340> or<00:05:21.580> business<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.950> job<00:05:23.950> is
