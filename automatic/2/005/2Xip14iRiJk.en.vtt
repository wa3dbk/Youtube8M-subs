00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.590
 life has been able to adapt to the most diverse places of the 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.780
 from the microscopic beings that inhabit the frozen landscapes of the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 poles to those of the hottest waters from the birds that fly to elevated 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.589
 altitude 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.170
 to the fish of the oceanic abysses our planet is full of 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.099
 living organisms 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.949
 they all make up a gigantic library where history is accumulated 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 of the planet of the last three thousand 500 million years 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.900
 since the appearance of the first row 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.340
 precisely the study of different living forms has allowed us 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.460
 discover how they have evolved from the simplest bacteria to the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.200
 more complex 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.829
 and even though we think we know them all 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 we are really only able to identify with a man at 10% of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010
 they 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.560
 the remaining 90% are still a mystery to the minor 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 the vast majority of them are not visible to the naked eye for us 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 but its importance is vital to our very existence 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 they are responsible for rebalancing the different components of the atmosphere 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.550
 is to purify the air we breathe, to recycle the waste of nature 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.100
 so that from the dead organic matter can be born again 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 lifetime 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.210
 and it is that the distribution of the tasks necessary for the maintenance of the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.010
 ecosystems is very complex and requires the activity of all its components 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.620
 the more species and manage more productive ecosystem and 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.690
 will establish this and greater capacity for recovery will have in case of occurrence 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.930
 a drought, a fire or any other circumstance that endangers your 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.620
 Balance 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.230
 with so many and biodiversity decreases if some species are extinguished 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.860
 effectiveness of the system can be affected with it our own 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.840
 existence 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.870
 So far scientists have begun to realize this 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.100
 In 1997 a team of economists and environmental scientists tried 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.979
 measure in economic terms the services that the natural environment gives us 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.840
 without asking for anything in return and it turned out that they reached almost twice the product 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.840
 gross interior of all the countries of the world 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.500
 fact that we should not be surprised if we consider all the tasks that the 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:23.880
 nature solves us 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.980
 the figure of atmosphere and the climate purifies the sweet water Enriquez and the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220
 soil main nutrients 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.170
 of toxicity and that waste is responsible for the pollination of crops and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.349
 produces food and fuel line to humanity 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.809
 it has been important is the biodiversity of the planet
