00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 6 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.499
 which also guests and good homes where the fire on 800 royal and pale 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.140
 on the mosfets with the st 2010 and if i can be honest this is why he chose 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.300
 before I turn 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.310
 because this game I just go nice I finish 44 a 10 and I start really epic 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 with a seventeenth performance it is going to see it is really going at a given moment 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.989
 long with the guys 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.399
 I put that being built with the throat shot when that fire ended 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.330
 I am actually a bit higher in that area 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.390
 and i know she gets exciting in the neighborhood so i just watch two 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.470
 or three sides 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.990
 and I can actually just recognize them non-stop as it were 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.540
 without actually having to stop walking around because yes I can 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.180
 Walked to the ground, but if it doesn't keep coming, why should I do the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.870
 the other side of the folder 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.970
 yeah that's just no reason for me so i kinda stayed in this area because me 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.130
 knew that he stayed with exciting is that they come to life 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.080
 m yes in a short time just have fun by the way with that guy 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.360
 who will come right next to me where was that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.190
 somewhere 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.950
 I do not know full but now here so beautiful because the hand and here to go 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.990
 own performance next to me 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.829
 that really is that I am so lucky that normally not the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.970
 Being a champion but I was lucky it also survives the bethel goes 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.030
 as probable 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940
 but this just a wonderful doorman 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.790
 yes where I just make a lot of kills m the commercial or art on 12 already describe 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.700
 and you are just a bit of cosi for me to drive but this is one 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.860
 kind of it a video i was going to do better 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.180
 an x-ray the wall i am not going 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.090
 only the enduring klodden and not just camp ghosts 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.820
 because many people ask me reactions arjan do you want two buildings at black ops 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.430
 klÃ¶den well then I am certainly willing to do I am also sure 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.000
 plan to be positive 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.909
 with or 2 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.619
 instead of cannes in the box, well cosimco juices continue to do but me 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.290
 swap them a bit 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.650
 emmen 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.530
 yes i will just try to find a flexible or changing system 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.460
 for black ops 2 and columns the teacher is about to be successful right from the start 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.159
 Saturday of today is of course motor grief 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.119
 I thought yes you know I have done Kamphorst three times in the past two times 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
 so that I first want to go and try for our sadness 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.719
 although the start of a game was not super as you can have them 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.639
 probably because it says online if it is right but it really started 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.040
 super under it actually did not study co in the last two or three days 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.879
 played 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.319
 and it is then really upside down pot to get you a natural again normal 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.139
 to get 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.539
 but I am now dying at 17 to 0 died 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:39.419
 hell basket 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.219
 yes I had something of late choosing to play the rest 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.329
 because 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.889
 in itself I am getting close to the church cause 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.869
 I want 17 ormel 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.749
 Sure, a few kills from a delta lloyd the van anyway 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:51.459
 probably 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.119
 but and in itself this is over and over 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.290
 nothing from 14 to 15 can spill kills 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.869
 there I am about eleven plus, let's see how far things can go 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.579
 but unfortunately want to get lifted fairly quickly 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.929
 but on 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.289
 what i just said 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.859
 I want a bit of coaching with the coaches I wanted there stamp plan 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.310
 of course what I have not actually done 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.779
 ghost chosen at the start 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.309
 because i can only tudors the newspaper for two or three weeks but i 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.889
 am planning to do that cost know is also jacques order yet 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.509
 get both shows for the new club 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.449
 look at whether there is a country that I don't know if it is up to one 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.199
 possibility but we will see 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.289
 stand 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.139
 yes if I stop that or that she is of course what I am often fed up with 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.960
 recovered as you probably do better 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.830
 and this time song by the way 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.299
 I lift for my team there again making it right 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.989
 with competitors I am right with emi especially because I could have a number of riders 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.919
 turn what thought 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.569
 but in any case 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:48.730
 I intend to do that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.910
 black ops two has a lot of tomorrow three, but another coach is there 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.250
 just to watch it I also intend 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.770
 oldemarkt road to drive back let come because I have had that for a long time 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.219
 he not posted 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.049
 and that was more because me 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 at the time 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.980
 only in seattle lobos marco but i was skyboxing file 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.639
 with patrick or meter 1008p 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.149
 and the server 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:16.099
 was at his house let's just say at patrick he was on the server recently 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.209
 put on his internet 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.970
 although always on that server 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.970
 as it were, a show is preserved 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.289
 and that he definitely stop with that youtube I also do not care about her 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.620
 basically let nothing know about it 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.169
 stopped from day to day at one time sometime in the summer 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.560
 m apparently the case he stopped is never heard of never 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.870
 heard more of the target series 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.150
 and that's how it is 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.490
 you just know that sucks 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.279
 and nothing to do about it 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.139
 and I didn't have the server myself, so that's a shame he couldn't go any further 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.529
 but on 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.729
 i'm looking for the f'jes because i want to use the makers of starbucks from then 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.029
 but I am in doubt because 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.249
 I found a server 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.060
 they chose skoda skippers solo sky boxes often unreachable sky boxes 5 lot 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.339
 say solo and that is also true, for example, code is red 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.460
 but yes that is not a word 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.020
 way I feel drowsy I've found where I can go solo can also be a tough job 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.669
 and which are also preserved 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.749
 so when i let me say the morning came out not all perish is what i have 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:19.400
 done 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.940
 but that real life remains and that no one can get around us 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.330
 so that nobody can destroy that nobody can mail it there 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.990
 so when you are on 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.110
 actually I also have a bike 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.999
 I want 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.379
 actually you can do our gearbox dangers again because that was 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.989
 very nice back then when i did i really experienced it and you thought it was 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:40.989
 apparently also nice to watch the Keukenhof in July 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.380
 but that has what I have to look at or that I am so green or with someone 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.129
 different 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:47.939
 I have in mind for someone 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.649
 only I don't know if the person really has the time and if they can use a server 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:53.759
 come for that 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.270
 and so regards watching 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.650
 and that's what I got from you and if tommaso is that there can also go together 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.940
 do that is absolutely beautiful only thing that is likely to do 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.290
 and if he does this is not the case that hard workers do solo but in the van 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.939
 arrives sky boxes 5 on 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.639
 because I know you enjoyed it 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.650
 m but yes that I go anyway prohibited reading liked it 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.319
 I like doing it 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.280
 And yes, I am going to spend some restrained years if you like it for my neck 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.979
 feels nice why that twice 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.490
 so I'm going to get that back 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.830
 all responses receive when and people who and how or what 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.990
 but that will be fine that is all for the coming time 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.330
 and of course work from black ops two as I said before did commander 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.599
 is going to come back again 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.919
 I don't know if the normal PC game will come back 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.309
 because I don't know how much time I have 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:41.309
 and how much effort I have to do former short week debleser 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.260
 talk you have there then you are just two teams that clearly there 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.039
 went kim jong il 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.529
 hopefully that goes 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.049
 but i can do that so look effe figuring out how it goes and i can 

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:53.919
 of course also see if that kick 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.449
 yes or that I would like work can do for the new time that she does 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.050
 be chill 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.249
 but yes that should all go but look sometimes 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.249
 at least for weeks to come I am planning many things 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.279
 but nothing can say about that and that is not just my own 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.649
 also for when it is other people 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:15.649
 but I can't say anything about that yet and I will 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.089
 yes if so far and nothing is certain yet 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:20.759
 that will come to let you know 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:24.460
 But those are fun things that fall and that will also be fun fury 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.499
 I didn't know if it was with the FIFA 

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.629
 will see that 

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.699
 more info this was brought guys later today as you may never have 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:36.020
 and as a bit messy could think it was because i was a bit whole 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.570
 different things where a group of boys well this was certainly with that 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:41.669
 Know that good laughs if you are from or after 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:44.490
 blue thumb thumbs up I always say wrong driving 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.100
 fuck yeah larry says sometime can say a third time 

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.740
 but well there was 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.270
 daf still look once
