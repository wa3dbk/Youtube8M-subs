00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 this week the tips that we are going to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.460
 give go to go on carnival look that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.460
 most beautiful masks 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.390
 good for our carnival mask 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.779
 This is very big, it's us 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.480
 our our blog we are going to put the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.280
 template and now in the video we're going 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.650
 to make this size smaller 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 to decorate cupcakes these by 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.059
 example are more then for more cakes 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.739
 large or for larger decoration 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.320
 because look at the size so big that 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.269
 have then well we are going to put the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.640
 template of the two sizes is worth but 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.800
 I 'm going to do it for you now 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320
 so you can see how easy fast and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 how beautiful is it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.820
 more is a little bit your pasta 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.570
 gum or fondant is worth and with the roller the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 let's stretch 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.350
 let finite 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's see 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 it stretches rather 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.760
 because equality comes and is for all 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.270
 parts 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 or not 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.140
 so do not stick 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.780
 A) Yes 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.360
 again 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.830
 ah 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.830
 good 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:55.750
 and now we have to catch 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.460
 Template 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.540
 and put it on top of the rubber paste or 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.910
 of the case and with a precision cutter 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.100
 you are cutting by the edges 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 if you do not learn a lot with your fingers 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.870
 because if you are not going to keep the brand 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.480
 of the fingers when you lift the paper 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.300
 so you have to hold without being 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.300
 new but not squeezing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.430
 you are not doing it the way 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.430
 now I teach it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.510
 brand that is assured is to mark well 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.390
 of cutting everywhere before 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.390
 lift the template 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.460
 and now the little eyes like that 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.500
 You can do this eye shape 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.900
 also with a small cutter 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.920
 tear 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.079
 if you want if you do not find it very easy 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.090
 do it with the cutter because being zones 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.220
 so small, it's a little 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.480
 complicated and with a tear cutter 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.290
 it comes out the same and this now you pick up 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.879
 the template and you see 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.750
 be careful in case it has not been cut 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:20.730
 well go back to review 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 and here you have 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.459
 the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.600
 more cut face now is you would have it 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.490
 let it dry 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.730
 in a straw as it is very easy to crush 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.630
 well a little bit in the area of â€‹â€‹the nose and 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.010
 you leave dry 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.650
 Well, in half an hour something like that is already 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.400
 dry to decorate we have here 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.920
 you see the way we've just left 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.320
 dry a little while in the straw for 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.160
 now decorate it with you 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.970
 then we would let it dry like this 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.160
 and we're going to let her go 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.730
 to go to decorate it good I'm going to 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.370
 teach a super easy trick 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.330
 to make the decoration of the dots 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.690
 from around 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.580
 we have mixed dye in gel or in 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.820
 pasta as you have it with a bit of 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.130
 alcohol type gin and with a toothpick 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.710
 that has taught us a stick of 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.530
 which has in the back flat 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.620
 As I did in this case, I caught 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:36.270
 purple like I did a little and look at you 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.270
 making dots 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.550
 around the edge 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.729
 it dries up because you are wetting another 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.729
 time 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.200
 good decoration you can do as 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.620
 ye us you are teaching 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.050
 that you do not need to have a brush for 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.000
 make a decoration of this type if not 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.000
 you have a brush and you see that with a toothpick 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.119
 we can be super cool 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.240
 little by little 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.229
 you are putting the unborn 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.560
 to go wet and you go repeating in the 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.330
 place that you want you to have a 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.330
 little bit fatter 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.000
 in these little ones as you see so much 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.000
 so that you can fit 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.480
 look what else chuli 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.840
 we are going to surround it all whole that I 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.100
 fancy 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.100
 we are putting like this 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.040
 i 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.040
 and ticket and 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.449
 the last ones let's start with this 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.080
 side 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.629
 be careful because if it goes away and 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.110
 you paint a lot because you spend if there is a 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.110
 pacifier 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.750
 with a little patience and now 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.630
 we have it decorated that you want to give it a 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:28.840
 little bit more decoration because 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.210
 example you can put around the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.990
 eyes as we have done here also more 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.840
 lugarcitos or for example with 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.850
 edible ink markers for 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.790
 example here I have gold has a 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:48.080
 wider part and a narrower one 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:51.310
 we can put it around the eyes 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.610
 the area of â€‹â€‹the eyes for example doradito 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:59.530
 so that it is more carnival 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.530
 Look how cool and fast 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:08.910
 Be careful not to squeeze too much because 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.340
 you see that it is very delicate 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.050
 I'm going to take the straw we had for 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.370
 here to not crush it as it is giving 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.280
 afraid to crush it like this so you hold it 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:23.370
 much easier and do not forget that 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.470
 is painted and how you support the finger 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.290
 whitman 6 whole 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.780
 You are putting me here in golden brown 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.180
 around the eyes and so is more 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.640
 finished that you want to do some 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.770
 more detail because you know how to throw 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.960
 imagination because with any little thing 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.960
 these masks are super cool 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.470
 ah
