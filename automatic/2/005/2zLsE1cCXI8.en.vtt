 Freedom is fighting 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.070

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.859
 even in a very difficult staff situation, sometimes reading aloud 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.289
 Unfortunately, you also play on your own with the new team and like it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.980

 Team Player Deluxe 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.770
 but I believe experiments also works for six months I have this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.319
 Book read on the weekend 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.739
 Therefore, he should try but the philosophy already read but the book 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.780
 is unbelievably laborious to read it is more read aloud question sir 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.290
 Gudrun but now embarrassing on their homepage a great summary 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.960
 Franzi's book is written very elegantly and admires that they are so good 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 can write such a hobby of mine 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630
 I like to come write 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.160
 that's what Lammert said 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.970
 he would have believed that writing comments is a hobby 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.500
 from me 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.350
 then I have this text on the homepage about this book where they are 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.240
 describe where at least as much as you like 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.520
 but an internet search engine running but not with the rear disaster 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 not at all know each other long before the hedges already last week and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.750
 Do you know where I found the text? 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.070
 after a right-wing german internet homepage 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.630
 but from the year 1998 so long before hers 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 Homepage 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.310
 not written by them but by their Hatzenbichler 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.100
 the plan was currently a professed neo-Nazi 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.860
 there is the text you have on your homepage 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.820
 the factor verbatim written off I can 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.720
 I did not write the text and I can do that too 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 not imagine Â», however, saw himself also probably cut 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.539
 not extended Dr

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.209
 Both sides of the Oberhausener in the OPEC not self-written songs 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.059
 are winter sun defenses Advent in a startling 

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:04.560
 Explanation certain made position at Schnadt that the texts where they pass 

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:08.159
 her favorite music slices the Berlin's favorite books and so they say why 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:08.929
 that likes so much 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.179
 I'm afraid 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.759
 which ones are a definite one 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.529
 as her coworkers these texts from right-radical Homepage is thus only 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.199
 praised the air she had choked her order was confirmed 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.389
 The conclusion of the US vetos deflation sees artists believes

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.150
 to show 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.630
 but that is not a homepage because in these circles that means home 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.289
 page 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.829
 and the undersigned this page was last time at Free Starks 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.029
 the ninth he comes to you in arms 4152 updated 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.509
 because of the missed but also the big cases had occurred 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.439
 but this is essentially only with which they have the text for the book 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.969
 complained that in the US that will meet the needs of 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.559
 But then passengers can achieve something without anything 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:57.129
 I also do not want to judge growing and the text of that 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.369
 Book describes there are certainly no right-wing radicals and which on the plate 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.959
 and orders are to be rejected by the great love of the squad
