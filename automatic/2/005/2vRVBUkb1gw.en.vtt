think<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> matters<00:00:38.219> too<00:00:38.700> much<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
think it matters too much which one to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.490 
think it matters too much which one to
do<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.600> looks<00:00:39.780> pretty<00:00:39.989> awesome<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
want to beat up zerglings so we're gonna

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
want to beat up zerglings so we're gonna
get<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.329> either<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.930> works<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.290> believe<00:00:43.559> for

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
get that either one works I believe for

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
get that either one works I believe for
what<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:43.980> gonna<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.190> doing<00:00:44.840> predator<00:00:45.840> sucks

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

get<00:00:46.469> Hercules<00:00:46.920> even<00:00:47.250> though<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> never<00:00:47.579> really

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get Hercules even though I never really

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.910 
get Hercules even though I never really
use<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> either<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> tricky

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
use that either now this one is tricky

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
use that either now this one is tricky
because<00:00:50.910> bio<00:00:51.660> steel<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> pretty<00:00:52.379> sweet

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
because bio steel is pretty sweet

because bio steel is pretty sweet
regenerating<00:00:53.370> life<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
regenerating life and all that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.369 
regenerating life and all that
especially<00:00:55.020> later<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.300> but<00:00:57.300> SCV's<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.230> also

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
especially later on but SCV's can also

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
especially later on but SCV's can also
do<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.309> Park<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.730> STV<00:01:00.149> by<00:01:00.390> siege<00:01:00.629> tanks

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
do that just Park an STV by siege tanks

almost here something like that so I am
going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.290> interactor<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> know

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
going to get some interactor now I know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to get some interactor now I know
a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> people<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.290> mine

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
a lot of people like I have mine

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.870 
a lot of people like I have mine
forgetting<00:01:31.829> ultras<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> having<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.640> tank

forgetting ultras and having them tank

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
forgetting ultras and having them tank
for<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> pretty<00:01:34.259> long

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
for you but it's got a pretty long

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.230

effectiveness of tanks because you put

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.770 
effectiveness of tanks because you put
tanks<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.110> your<00:01:43.290> side<00:01:43.470> disruptor<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.780> in

the<00:01:46.049> last<00:01:46.229> mission<00:01:46.500> spoiler<00:01:47.340> alert<00:01:47.640> I'll<00:01:47.850> be

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the last mission spoiler alert I'll be

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.539 
the last mission spoiler alert I'll be
doing<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> ground<00:01:48.540> mission<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.460> think

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
doing the ground mission and so I think

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
doing the ground mission and so I think
scientists<00:01:51.119> Reptar<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:52.079> if

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
scientists Reptar is the way to go if

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
scientists Reptar is the way to go if
you're<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.579> good<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.820> micro<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> mean

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you're really good at micro in I mean

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.319 
you're really good at micro in I mean
you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> use<00:01:55.049> hide<00:01:55.229> mine<00:01:55.439> emulator<00:01:55.939> but<00:01:56.939> for

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you can use hide mine emulator but for

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
you can use hide mine emulator but for
people<00:01:57.509> having<00:01:57.630> trouble<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.079> last<00:01:58.259> mission<00:01:58.680> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
people having trouble to last mission I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
people having trouble to last mission I
think<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.399> should<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.610> sigh<00:01:59.790> disruptor

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
think you should go sigh disruptor

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.030 
think you should go sigh disruptor
because<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> will<00:02:00.840> slow<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.290> enemies<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because it will slow all enemies and you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
because it will slow all enemies and you
can<00:02:02.189> tank<00:02:02.399> them

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
can tank them

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.219 
can tank them
always<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:04.920> attack<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.110> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
always go for attack you this is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.589 
always go for attack you this is
offensive<00:02:07.590> minded

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
offensive minded

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.300 
offensive minded
so<00:02:09.409> yes<00:02:10.599> corporal<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.780> depots<00:02:12.049> are<00:02:12.230> cool<00:02:12.439> but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
so yes corporal the depots are cool but

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.940 
so yes corporal the depots are cool but
getting<00:02:13.909> gas<00:02:14.060> 25%<00:02:14.810> faster<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.379> amazing

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
getting gas 25% faster is just amazing

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.039 
getting gas 25% faster is just amazing
since<00:02:16.370> most<00:02:16.790> units<00:02:17.180> are<00:02:17.299> pretty<00:02:17.450> gas<00:02:17.659> heavy

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
since most units are pretty gas heavy

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.020 
since most units are pretty gas heavy
and<00:02:18.349> especially<00:02:19.099> once<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.430> get<00:02:19.519> mules<00:02:19.760> you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
and especially once you get mules you

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.059 
and especially once you get mules you
always<00:02:20.299> need<00:02:20.450> gas<00:02:20.659> more<00:02:21.049> than<00:02:21.230> minerals<00:02:21.560> so

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
always need gas more than minerals so

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.160 
always need gas more than minerals so
that's<00:02:22.219> pretty<00:02:22.430> simple<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.900> two<00:02:27.049> of

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's pretty simple now the two of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.539 
that's pretty simple now the two of
Seavey's<00:02:27.470> I've<00:02:27.829> talked<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.129> some<00:02:28.280> people<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
Seavey's I've talked to some people that

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.199 
Seavey's I've talked to some people that
like<00:02:28.790> it

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
like it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.000 
like it
I<00:02:29.239> disagree<00:02:30.019> though<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.409> couple<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.890> reasons

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
I disagree though a couple of reasons

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.759 
I disagree though a couple of reasons
one<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.849> lot<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.750> maps<00:02:32.989> start<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.409> out<00:02:33.439> with<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
one a lot of maps start you out with the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.860 
one a lot of maps start you out with the
refinery<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.519> only<00:02:34.700> like<00:02:34.879> five<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.269> six<00:02:35.299> SUVs

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
refinery but only like five or six SUVs

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.839 
refinery but only like five or six SUVs
so<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.650> can't<00:02:36.889> really<00:02:37.099> mine<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.519> refinery

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
so you can't really mine that refinery

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.300 
so you can't really mine that refinery
for<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> while<00:02:38.560> whereas<00:02:39.560> if<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.889> Automator

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
for a while whereas if we have Automator

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.949 
for a while whereas if we have Automator
refinery<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.629> build<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
refinery you can just build the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.569 
refinery you can just build the
refineries<00:02:42.379> right<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:43.069> by<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.220> time<00:02:43.459> you

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
refineries right off and by the time you

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.890 
refineries right off and by the time you
get<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:43.730> mineral<00:02:44.060> saturated<00:02:44.629> you<00:02:44.689> have<00:02:44.780> like

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
get your mineral saturated you have like

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.710 
get your mineral saturated you have like
a<00:02:45.049> thousand<00:02:45.620> gas<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.459> once<00:02:47.000> again<00:02:47.150> gas<00:02:47.510> is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
a thousand gas and once again gas is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.740 
a thousand gas and once again gas is
hard<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.989> come<00:02:48.169> by<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:48.560> that's<00:02:48.680> awesome<00:02:49.340> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
hard to come by so that's awesome and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.289 
hard to come by so that's awesome and
two<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.709> first<00:02:51.889> six<00:02:52.250> SUVs<00:02:52.790> your<00:02:53.000> double

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
two the first six SUVs your double

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.990 
two the first six SUVs your double
training<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:55.280> would<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.519> going<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.819> gas

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
training some would be going to gas

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.890 
training some would be going to gas
anyway<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.669> don't<00:02:58.909> really<00:02:59.209> need<00:02:59.599> those

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
anyway so you don't really need those

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.750 
anyway so you don't really need those
guys<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:00.470> some<00:03:00.709> maps<00:03:01.189> even<00:03:01.430> have<00:03:01.549> three

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
guys and some maps even have three

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
guys and some maps even have three
geysers<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.620> three<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.909> is<00:03:04.970> kind<00:03:05.419> of<00:03:05.540> minor

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
geysers and three this is kind of minor

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.750 
geysers and three this is kind of minor
but<00:03:06.139> if<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.739> have<00:03:06.829> two<00:03:07.010> bases<00:03:07.459> with<00:03:07.730> two

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
but if you have two bases with two

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.849 
but if you have two bases with two
geysers<00:03:08.239> each<00:03:08.419> that's<00:03:08.689> twelve<00:03:09.079> food<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.409> SUVs

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
geysers each that's twelve food of SUVs

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.460 
geysers each that's twelve food of SUVs
getting<00:03:10.250> gas<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.790> could<00:03:11.030> be<00:03:11.090> units<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
getting gas that could be units and a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
getting gas that could be units and a
lot<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.680> these<00:03:12.859> missions<00:03:13.579> are<00:03:13.639> gonna<00:03:13.819> max<00:03:14.030> out

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
lot of these missions are gonna max out

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.629 
lot of these missions are gonna max out
your<00:03:14.329> food<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.349> don't<00:03:15.769> know<00:03:15.829> Auto<00:03:16.129> refinery

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
your food so I don't know Auto refinery

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.300 
your food so I don't know Auto refinery
I<00:03:16.699> think<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.299> quite<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.569> bit<00:03:17.750> better

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I think is quite a bit better

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.349 
I think is quite a bit better
Raven<00:03:19.310> Science<00:03:19.639> Vessel<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:20.090> can<00:03:20.239> use

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
Raven Science Vessel you can use

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.969 
Raven Science Vessel you can use
whichever<00:03:20.989> one<00:03:21.139> are<00:03:21.290> more<00:03:21.409> comfortable<00:03:21.620> with

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
whichever one are more comfortable with

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:28.619 
whichever one are more comfortable with
I<00:03:22.479> prefer<00:03:23.560> Ravens<00:03:24.560> because<00:03:26.049> well<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.349> just<00:03:28.310> do

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
I prefer Ravens because well I just do

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.379 
I prefer Ravens because well I just do

fall<00:03:36.739> behind<00:03:36.889> on<00:03:37.129> buildings<00:03:37.519> it's<00:03:37.699> really

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
fall behind on buildings it's really

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.719 
fall behind on buildings it's really
good<00:03:38.530> orbital<00:03:39.530> strike<00:03:39.769> seems<00:03:40.220> really<00:03:40.549> cool

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
good orbital strike seems really cool

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.710 
good orbital strike seems really cool
like<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.449> get<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:41.629> warpgate<00:03:42.109> protoss<00:03:43.069> style

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
like you get a warpgate protoss style

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.390 
like you get a warpgate protoss style
but<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:45.079> lot<00:03:45.440> of<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.620> missions<00:03:45.799> you're<00:03:46.310> gonna

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
but a lot of the missions you're gonna

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.099 
but a lot of the missions you're gonna
win<00:03:46.639> on<00:03:46.790> your<00:03:46.940> first<00:03:47.150> push<00:03:47.419> you're<00:03:47.930> just

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
win on your first push you're just

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.839 
win on your first push you're just
basically<00:03:48.349> defending<00:03:49.099> amassing<00:03:49.579> them<00:03:49.669> and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
basically defending amassing them and

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.909 
basically defending amassing them and
winning<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.989> lot<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.169> missions<00:03:51.379> you<00:03:51.739> don't

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
winning and a lot of missions you don't

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.119 
winning and a lot of missions you don't
even<00:03:52.069> have<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.459> push<00:03:52.639> at<00:03:52.879> all<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.329> kill

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
even have to push at all you just kill

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.300 
even have to push at all you just kill
her<00:03:55.129> kill<00:03:55.609> defend<00:03:56.180> live<00:03:56.659> stuff<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.169> that<00:03:57.409> so

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310

her kill defend live stuff like that so
I<00:03:58.970> don't<00:03:59.269> like<00:03:59.689> tech<00:03:59.870> reactor<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.319> lot<00:04:00.530> when<00:04:00.739> I

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
I don't like tech reactor a lot when I

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.860 
I don't like tech reactor a lot when I
get<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.129> that<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.030> there<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.269> go<00:04:02.449> there's<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
get to that so there you go there's the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.009 
get to that so there you go there's the
research<00:04:03.409> I<00:04:03.650> will<00:04:03.859> be<00:04:03.979> getting<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:05.209> entire

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
research I will be getting this entire

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.619 
research I will be getting this entire
mission<00:04:06.519> mission<00:04:07.519> campaign<00:04:09.040> onto<00:04:10.040> our<00:04:10.159> armory

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
mission mission campaign onto our armory

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.170 
mission mission campaign onto our armory
what<00:04:11.629> do<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.840> have<00:04:12.019> here<00:04:12.609> orbital<00:04:13.609> commands

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
what do we have here orbital commands

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.899 
what do we have here orbital commands
yes<00:04:15.079> we<00:04:15.290> all<00:04:15.409> know<00:04:15.560> how<00:04:15.709> imbalance<00:04:16.370> meals<00:04:16.609> are

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
yes we all know how imbalance meals are

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.149 
yes we all know how imbalance meals are
so<00:04:17.209> we<00:04:17.389> will<00:04:17.599> be<00:04:17.690> getting<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.079> my<00:04:18.769> next<00:04:19.039> will

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
so we will be getting that my next will

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.580 
so we will be getting that my next will
be<00:04:19.190> fire<00:04:19.459> suppression<00:04:20.000> system<00:04:20.389> because

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
be fire suppression system because

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.440 
be fire suppression system because
the<00:04:22.590> 50%<00:04:23.190> life<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.970> structures

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
the 50% life and structures

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.110 
the 50% life and structures
automatically<00:04:25.370> putting<00:04:26.370> fires<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.880> it's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
automatically putting fires out it's

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.790 
automatically putting fires out it's
pretty<00:04:27.330> awesome<00:04:27.560> especially<00:04:28.560> for<00:04:28.680> like

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
pretty awesome especially for like

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.330 
pretty awesome especially for like
bunkers<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.370> turrets<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.820> stuff<00:04:30.740> so<00:04:31.740> yeah

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340
