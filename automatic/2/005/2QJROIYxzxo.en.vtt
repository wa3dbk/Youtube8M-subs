you<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:05.370> scraping<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.150> walls<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.569> your

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
you about scraping the walls of your

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.720 
you about scraping the walls of your
pumpkin

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
pumpkin

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.250 
pumpkin
so<00:00:08.730> once<00:00:08.910> you've<00:00:09.179> scooped<00:00:09.540> out<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
so once you've scooped out all of the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.999 
so once you've scooped out all of the
seeds<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.650> strings<00:00:12.019> it's<00:00:13.019> time<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.590> scrape

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
seeds and strings it's time to scrape

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.029 
seeds and strings it's time to scrape
the<00:00:14.280> walls<00:00:14.960> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.020> important<00:00:16.590> because<00:00:16.800> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the walls this is important because you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.460 
the walls this is important because you
want<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> make<00:00:17.400> sure<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.960> skin<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> your

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
want to make sure that the skin of your

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.810 
want to make sure that the skin of your
pumpkin<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.039> spin<00:00:20.250> enough<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.730> carve<00:00:20.970> into<00:00:22.820> but

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
pumpkin is spin enough to carve into but

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.400 
pumpkin is spin enough to carve into but
make<00:00:23.970> sure<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.269> not<00:00:24.300> too<00:00:24.630> thin<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.289> if

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
make sure it's not too thin because if

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.019 
make sure it's not too thin because if
it's<00:00:25.529> too<00:00:25.740> thin<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.310> your<00:00:26.430> pumpkins<00:00:26.789> going

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
it's too thin then your pumpkins going

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580 
it's too thin then your pumpkins going
to<00:00:27.119> collapse<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> pressure<00:00:28.349> from

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to collapse because the pressure from

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
to collapse because the pressure from
cutting<00:00:28.980> into<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.240> too<00:00:30.269> great

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
cutting into it will just be too great

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380 
cutting into it will just be too great
the<00:00:31.130> best<00:00:32.130> thing<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.880> scraping<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the best thing to use for scraping the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.850 
the best thing to use for scraping the
walls<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.230> metal<00:00:34.530> spoon<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> dig<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
walls is a metal spoon so dig in to the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.450 
walls is a metal spoon so dig in to the
pumpkin<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:45.170> scoop<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.379> hunks<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
pumpkin a little bit scoop out hunks of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.650 
pumpkin a little bit scoop out hunks of
pumpkin<00:00:47.910> flush<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:50.239> now<00:00:51.239> while<00:00:51.449> you're

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
pumpkin flush like this now while you're

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.139 
pumpkin flush like this now while you're
doing<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.530> sure<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.789> keep<00:00:53.969> your

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149

doing this make sure that you keep your
hands<00:00:54.360> relatively<00:00:54.809> dry<00:00:55.199> because<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.460> you're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
hands relatively dry because if you're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
hands relatively dry because if you're
pushing<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.809> hard<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> spoon

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
pushing down really hard on the spoon

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.720 
pushing down really hard on the spoon
and<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.859> hands<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.219> wet<00:00:59.340> they're<00:00:59.579> gonna

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and your hands are wet they're gonna

slide off and you're gonna end up

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.870 
slide off and you're gonna end up
hurting<00:01:01.230> yourself<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.979> take

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
hurting yourself so if you need to take

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
hurting yourself so if you need to take
a<00:01:05.909> break<00:01:06.210> every<00:01:06.540> once<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> while<00:01:07.189> to<00:01:08.189> dry

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
a break every once in a while to dry

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.770 
a break every once in a while to dry
your<00:01:08.490> hands<00:01:08.729> off<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> paper<00:01:09.479> towel<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:14.780> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
your hands off on a paper towel and you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
your hands off on a paper towel and you
should<00:01:15.960> expect<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.500> process<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.250> take<00:01:17.430> at

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
should expect this process to take at

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.960 
should expect this process to take at
least<00:01:17.820> 15<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.450> 20<00:01:18.720> minutes<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.979> patient<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
least 15 or 20 minutes so be patient and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.210 
least 15 or 20 minutes so be patient and
it<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.810> pay<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> end<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:23.040> while

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
it will pay off in the end because while

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
it will pay off in the end because while
you're<00:01:23.369> cutting<00:01:23.600> it'll<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.900> easier<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you're cutting it'll be much easier to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.850 
you're cutting it'll be much easier to
do<00:01:30.020> one<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> make<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.829> process

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
do one thing that can make the process

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.969 
do one thing that can make the process
much<00:01:32.490> faster<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:33.240> scraping<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> walls<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
much faster is scraping the walls into a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.149 
much faster is scraping the walls into a
pile<00:01:35.689> at<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> bottom<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> pumpkin<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
pile at the bottom of the pumpkin and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
pile at the bottom of the pumpkin and
then<00:01:38.790> once<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> large<00:01:39.630> amount<00:01:39.840> down

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
then once you have a large amount down

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
then once you have a large amount down
there<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.460> reach<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> take<00:01:42.600> out

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
there you can just reach in and take out

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.630 
there you can just reach in and take out
handfuls<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> time

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.010 

also<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:52.500> make<00:01:52.620> sure<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> thorough<00:01:53.190> job

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
also to make sure you do a thorough job

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.800 
also to make sure you do a thorough job
start<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.230> one<00:01:55.440> side<00:01:55.970> scrape<00:01:56.970> all<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.300> way<00:01:57.630> up

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
start at one side scrape all the way up

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
start at one side scrape all the way up
get<00:01:58.290> everything<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.800> of<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> wall<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.600> then

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
get everything off of that wall and then

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.590 
get everything off of that wall and then
turn<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.050> pumpkin<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.440> little<00:02:01.650> bit<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> then

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
turn the pumpkin a little bit and then

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.140 
turn the pumpkin a little bit and then
scrape<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.440> next<00:02:04.650> part<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.940> can

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
scrape the next part this way you can

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.669 
scrape the next part this way you can
make<00:02:06.300> sure<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.690> don't<00:02:06.780> miss<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> spot

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.100 

another<00:02:10.679> thing<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> remember<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.790> scrape

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
another thing to remember is to scrape

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.470 
another thing to remember is to scrape
underneath<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:14.070> top<00:02:14.310> part<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:14.940> very<00:02:15.210> easy

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
underneath the top part it's very easy

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.850 
underneath the top part it's very easy
to<00:02:15.570> forget<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.050> part<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> can't

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
to forget this part because you can't

going<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.330> important

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
going to go so it's really important

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.360 
going to go so it's really important
that<00:02:22.130> there's<00:02:23.130> nothing<00:02:23.430> hanging<00:02:23.640> down<00:02:25.370> once

that there's nothing hanging down once

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.560 
that there's nothing hanging down once
you<00:02:26.520> think<00:02:26.670> you've<00:02:26.850> gotten<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.390> about

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
you think you've gotten just about

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.480 
you think you've gotten just about
everything<00:02:27.900> out<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.650> for<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.160> pumpkins

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
everything out and for your pumpkins

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.030 
everything out and for your pumpkins

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
small enough you can turn it upside down

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.920 
small enough you can turn it upside down
and<00:02:32.040> shake<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.459> anything<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:33.510> still<00:02:33.720> left

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
