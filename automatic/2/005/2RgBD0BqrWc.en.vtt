okay<00:00:10.509> so<00:00:10.570> after<00:00:11.530> removing<00:00:12.040> the<00:00:12.280> ROM<00:00:13.089> chip<00:00:13.389> from

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
okay so after removing the ROM chip from

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.680 
okay so after removing the ROM chip from
the<00:00:13.900> Game<00:00:14.110> Boy<00:00:14.259> cartridge<00:00:14.559> PCB<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.549> next<00:00:16.510> step

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
the Game Boy cartridge PCB the next step

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.400 
the Game Boy cartridge PCB the next step
is<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:17.230> interface<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.190> flash<00:00:19.150> chip<00:00:19.450> with<00:00:20.050> your

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
is to interface the flash chip with your

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.040 
is to interface the flash chip with your
PCB<00:00:21.010> using<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:21.760> interface<00:00:22.420> wires<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.810> we<00:00:25.930> have

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
PCB using the interface wires so we have

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.320 
PCB using the interface wires so we have
to<00:00:26.170> make<00:00:26.350> sure<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.830> we<00:00:26.980> interface<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.910> flash

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
to make sure that we interface the flash

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.620 
to make sure that we interface the flash
chip<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.380> PCB<00:00:30.160> with<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.000> correct<00:00:31.300> pin

small<00:01:01.960> in<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> beginning<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:04.180> more<00:01:04.629> than

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
small in the beginning so it's more than

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.060 
small in the beginning so it's more than
you<00:01:04.900> need<00:01:05.080> when<00:01:05.260> if<00:01:05.409> you're<00:01:05.560> playing<00:01:05.979> around

with your own in-game clothes now

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.420 
with your own in-game clothes now
there's<00:01:11.620> a<00:01:11.680> couple<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.979> ways<00:01:12.100> that<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.340> could

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
there's a couple of ways that you could

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.340 
there's a couple of ways that you could
do<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:12.700> project<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.600> choose<00:01:13.990> to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
do this project you can choose to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.380 
do this project you can choose to
actually<00:01:14.800> have<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.310> Atmel<00:01:15.760> flash<00:01:16.060> chip

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
actually have the Atmel flash chip

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.600 
actually have the Atmel flash chip
embedded<00:01:16.720> directly<00:01:17.560> inside<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.010> cartridge

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
embedded directly inside the cartridge

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.940 
embedded directly inside the cartridge
and<00:01:18.850> leave<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:19.810> there<00:01:19.840> permanently<00:01:20.200> connected

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
and leave it there permanently connected

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.130 
and leave it there permanently connected
so<00:01:21.670> using<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.120> type<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.570> programming

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
so using this type of a programming

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.250 
so using this type of a programming
interface<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.860> dockable<00:01:24.820> cartridge<00:01:25.390> type<00:01:26.080> of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
interface the dockable cartridge type of

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.190 
interface the dockable cartridge type of
a<00:01:26.350> programmer<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.850> signals<00:01:28.360> for<00:01:28.600> programming

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
a programmer the signals for programming

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.660 
a programmer the signals for programming
the<00:01:29.260> chip<00:01:29.530> are<00:01:29.710> actually<00:01:30.070> sent<00:01:30.369> through<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the chip are actually sent through the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
the chip are actually sent through the
trace<00:01:31.090> lines<00:01:31.330> of<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> cartridge<00:01:32.260> PCB

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.450 

so<00:01:36.180> anyhow<00:01:36.780> essentially<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> next<00:01:38.070> step<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so anyhow essentially the next step is

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.390 
so anyhow essentially the next step is
to<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.730> follow<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.480> in<00:01:40.140> wiring<00:01:40.860> diagram

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
connections those are for so the ROM

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.320 
connections those are for so the ROM
connections<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.770> chip<00:02:38.070> are<00:02:38.820> highlighted

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
connections for the chip are highlighted

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.970 
connections for the chip are highlighted
in<00:02:39.390> blue<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.110> diagram<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
in blue in the diagram and all of the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.850 
in blue in the diagram and all of the
appropriate<00:02:44.870> pin<00:02:45.870> designations<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
appropriate pin designations for the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.940 
appropriate pin designations for the
chip<00:02:47.100> are<00:02:47.310> labeled<00:02:47.970> accordingly<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:49.830> you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
chip are labeled accordingly so if you

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.380 
chip are labeled accordingly so if you
have<00:02:50.070> any<00:02:50.220> issues<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.239> always

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
have any issues with that you can always

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.620 
have any issues with that you can always
compare<00:02:52.230> those<00:02:52.440> connection<00:02:53.330> indicators<00:02:54.330> to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
compare those connection indicators to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.259 
compare those connection indicators to
the<00:02:54.870> datasheet<00:02:55.200> or<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.830> Atmel<00:02:56.160> flash<00:02:56.459> chip

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.050 

so<00:03:01.269> now<00:03:01.540> sometimes<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.709> data<00:03:03.040> sheets<00:03:03.430> have

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
so now sometimes the data sheets have

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.839 
so now sometimes the data sheets have
different<00:03:04.510> pin<00:03:05.110> assignment<00:03:05.560> names<00:03:05.849> compared

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
different pin assignment names compared

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.540 
different pin assignment names compared
to<00:03:07.060> other<00:03:07.480> data<00:03:07.750> sheets<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.430> an

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
to other data sheets and so just as an

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.750 
to other data sheets and so just as an
example<00:03:09.879> for<00:03:10.300> instance<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.760> cartridge

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
example for instance the the cartridge

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.009 
example for instance the the cartridge
PCB<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:14.019> labeled<00:03:14.530> d0<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.280> data<00:03:15.489> pin<00:03:15.760> 0<00:03:16.090> whereas

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
PCB is labeled d0 for data pin 0 whereas

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.479 
PCB is labeled d0 for data pin 0 whereas
in<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.230> datasheet<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.950> actually<00:03:18.400> is

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
in the datasheet it actually is

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.820 
in the datasheet it actually is
indicated<00:03:19.030> as<00:03:19.150> IO<00:03:19.420> for<00:03:20.049> input-output

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
indicated as IO for input-output

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.850 
indicated as IO for input-output
connections<00:03:21.519> 0<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.750> sometimes<00:03:23.680> they're

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
connections 0 so sometimes they're

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.229 
connections 0 so sometimes they're
different<00:03:24.099> so<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.819> have<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.150> aware

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
different so you just have to be aware

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.809 
different so you just have to be aware
of<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.629> but<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.440> always<00:03:26.709> check<00:03:27.010> and

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
of that but you can always check and

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.460 
of that but you can always check and
within<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.420> datasheet<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.959> should<00:03:29.110> explain

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
within the datasheet it should explain

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.650 
within the datasheet it should explain
what<00:03:29.650> those<00:03:29.830> pins<00:03:30.099> are<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:31.360> can<00:03:31.510> just

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
what those pins are and you can just

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.809 
what those pins are and you can just
confirm<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.590> they're<00:03:32.769> actually<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.220> data<00:03:33.549> pin

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
confirm that they're actually a data pin

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.140 
confirm that they're actually a data pin
or<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:34.420> address<00:03:34.599> pin<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.579> for<00:03:36.910> this

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150

those<00:04:57.680> connections<00:04:58.280> accordingly<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:59.270> you

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
those connections accordingly and you

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.350 
those connections accordingly and you
have<00:05:00.440> enough<00:05:00.680> room<00:05:00.920> to<00:05:00.950> push<00:05:01.910> all<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.180> wires

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
have enough room to push all the wires

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.270 
have enough room to push all the wires
inside<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.930> cartridge<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.710> should<00:05:03.980> be<00:05:04.070> fine

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
inside the cartridge you should be fine

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
inside the cartridge you should be fine
but<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:04.640> make<00:05:04.940> sure<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.210> don't<00:05:05.390> make<00:05:05.540> them

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
but just make sure you don't make them

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.870 
but just make sure you don't make them
too<00:05:05.840> long<00:05:05.990> because<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.560> don't<00:05:06.740> want<00:05:06.920> them<00:05:07.100> to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
too long because you don't want them to

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.950 
too long because you don't want them to
be<00:05:08.000> you<00:05:08.180> don't<00:05:08.300> want<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.540> cartridge

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
be you don't want the cartridge

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.020 
be you don't want the cartridge
enclosure<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.800> crowding<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.460> cramming

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
enclosure to be crowding and cramming

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.540 
enclosure to be crowding and cramming
the<00:05:11.120> wires<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:11.960> tight<00:05:12.260> that<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.560> may<00:05:13.370> cause

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
the wires and so tight that it may cause

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.200 
the wires and so tight that it may cause
you<00:05:13.610> issues<00:05:14.020> so<00:05:15.020> just<00:05:15.290> be<00:05:15.380> aware<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.770> so

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
you issues so just be aware of that so

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.490 
you issues so just be aware of that so
anyway<00:05:17.210> let's<00:05:17.510> move<00:05:17.750> on<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.140> soldering

anyway let's move on to the soldering

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.409 
anyway let's move on to the soldering
I'm<00:05:19.340> gonna<00:05:19.520> start<00:05:19.820> with<00:05:19.970> soldering<00:05:20.240> our

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
I'm gonna start with soldering our

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.840 
I'm gonna start with soldering our
interface<00:05:20.810> wires<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.530> PCB<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:25.580> now<00:05:25.790> to

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
interface wires to the PCB so now to

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.710 
interface wires to the PCB so now to
prepare<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.480> 30<00:05:26.840> gauge<00:05:27.080> wire<00:05:27.380> for<00:05:27.800> soldering

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
prepare the 30 gauge wire for soldering

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.140 
prepare the 30 gauge wire for soldering
what<00:05:29.720> we're<00:05:29.840> gonna<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.169> do<00:05:30.350> is<00:05:30.530> actually

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
what we're gonna have to do is actually

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.340 
what we're gonna have to do is actually
strip<00:05:32.150> off<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.540> wire<00:05:33.040> ends<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:35.060> this<00:05:35.930> wire<00:05:36.169> is

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
strip off the wire ends and this wire is

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.490 
strip off the wire ends and this wire is
extremely<00:05:37.130> difficult<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.669> strip<00:05:38.419> using<00:05:39.200> a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
extremely difficult to strip using a

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.490 
extremely difficult to strip using a
standard<00:05:40.250> wire<00:05:40.490> cutter<00:05:40.820> or<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.630> wire<00:05:42.110> stripping

standard wire cutter or a wire stripping

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.240 
standard wire cutter or a wire stripping
tool<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:44.780> one<00:05:44.960> thing<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.560> with<00:05:45.770> 30<00:05:46.040> gauge

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
tool the one thing is that with 30 gauge

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.719 
tool the one thing is that with 30 gauge
wire<00:05:46.550> or<00:05:46.790> even<00:05:47.030> 26<00:05:47.630> gauge<00:05:47.840> wire<00:05:48.160> most<00:05:49.160> wire

wire or even 26 gauge wire most wire

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.550 
wire or even 26 gauge wire most wire
strippers<00:05:50.210> do<00:05:50.419> not<00:05:50.540> have<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.900> particular

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
strippers do not have that particular

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.360 
strippers do not have that particular
type<00:05:51.919> of<00:05:51.950> gauge<00:05:52.220> is<00:05:52.640> very<00:05:53.270> very<00:05:53.540> small<00:05:54.220> so<00:05:55.220> what

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
type of gauge is very very small so what

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.710 
type of gauge is very very small so what
we're<00:05:55.490> gonna<00:05:55.550> need<00:05:55.790> is<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:55.940> special<00:05:56.330> stripping

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
we're gonna need is a special stripping

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.600 
we're gonna need is a special stripping
that<00:05:57.260> tool<00:05:57.470> for<00:05:57.740> this<00:05:57.830> particular<00:05:58.340> kind<00:05:58.550> of

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
that tool for this particular kind of

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.590 
that tool for this particular kind of
wire<00:05:58.790> and<00:06:00.070> usually<00:06:01.070> these<00:06:01.220> tools<00:06:01.550> will<00:06:02.270> strip

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
wire and usually these tools will strip

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.070 
wire and usually these tools will strip
gauges<00:06:03.229> 26<00:06:03.860> down<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.669> I<00:06:04.729> think<00:06:04.760> 32<00:06:05.510> I<00:06:05.540> think<00:06:05.930> is

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
gauges 26 down to I think 32 I think is

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.500 
gauges 26 down to I think 32 I think is
one<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.650> these<00:06:06.860> smallest<00:06:07.340> wired<00:06:07.940> gauges<00:06:08.390> that

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
one of these smallest wired gauges that

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.170 
one of these smallest wired gauges that
they<00:06:08.660> will<00:06:08.840> do<00:06:08.990> now<00:06:09.860> if<00:06:10.220> you<00:06:10.400> don't<00:06:10.580> have<00:06:10.910> one

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
they will do now if you don't have one

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.330 
they will do now if you don't have one
of<00:06:11.210> these<00:06:11.360> stripping<00:06:11.840> tools<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.470> can<00:06:12.590> I<00:06:13.160> can

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
of these stripping tools I can I can

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.379 
of these stripping tools I can I can
show<00:06:13.550> you<00:06:13.610> how<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:13.880> do<00:06:14.120> it<00:06:14.270> using<00:06:14.419> names

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
show you how to do it using names

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.920 
show you how to do it using names
using<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.169> regular<00:06:16.439> pair<00:06:16.770> of<00:06:16.919> wire<00:06:17.460> cutters<00:06:17.930> but

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
using a regular pair of wire cutters but

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.770 
using a regular pair of wire cutters but
it's<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.229> it's<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.650> tricky<00:06:20.150> procedure<00:06:21.150> to<00:06:21.360> do<00:06:21.509> and

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
it's a it's a tricky procedure to do and

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.080 
it's a it's a tricky procedure to do and
because<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.229> wire<00:06:22.409> is<00:06:22.590> so<00:06:22.830> delicate<00:06:23.099> it's

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
because the wire is so delicate it's

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.510 
because the wire is so delicate it's
easily<00:06:24.419> broken<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.439> you<00:06:25.469> have<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.889> it<00:06:26.250> takes<00:06:26.430> a

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
easily broken so you have to it takes a

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.800 
easily broken so you have to it takes a
controlled<00:06:26.909> hand<00:06:27.150> and<00:06:27.389> a<00:06:27.419> little<00:06:27.509> bit<00:06:27.719> of

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
controlled hand and a little bit of

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.309 
controlled hand and a little bit of
practice<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:30.090> so<00:06:30.270> by<00:06:30.419> pinching<00:06:30.840> a<00:06:30.930> wire<00:06:31.080> with

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
practice and so by pinching a wire with

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.050 
practice and so by pinching a wire with
your<00:06:31.349> your<00:06:31.919> thumb<00:06:32.159> and<00:06:32.310> your<00:06:32.430> index<00:06:32.460> finger

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
your your thumb and your index finger

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.800 
your your thumb and your index finger
and<00:06:33.210> then<00:06:34.189> resting<00:06:35.189> the<00:06:35.699> wire<00:06:36.180> strippers<00:06:36.659> up

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
and then resting the wire strippers up

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.600 
and then resting the wire strippers up
against<00:06:37.199> your<00:06:37.349> your<00:06:37.770> thumb<00:06:38.129> and<00:06:38.370> your<00:06:38.580> index

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
against your your thumb and your index
