dimensional mountain and you can ski in
things<00:02:33.189> like<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.370> then<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:34.659> was<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.109> of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
things like that then I was kind of

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.220 
things like that then I was kind of
really<00:02:35.409> interesting<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:36.129> kind<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.400> portraying

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
really interesting in kind of portraying

the reason I'm filming from a call then

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.000 
the reason I'm filming from a call then
you<00:03:16.389> have<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:16.870> speed<00:03:17.199> depending<00:03:17.829> on<00:03:17.919> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
you have the speed depending on the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.039 
you have the speed depending on the
speed<00:03:18.219> of<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.489> car<00:03:18.699> then<00:03:18.939> there<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
speed of the car then there is the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.749 
speed of the car then there is the
landscape<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.739> kind<00:03:21.009> of<00:03:21.069> running<00:03:21.579> really

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:21.759 
landscape that kind of running really

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:24.689 
landscape that kind of running really
fast<00:03:22.349> or<00:03:23.349> slow<00:03:23.739> depending<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.489> speed<00:03:24.669> of

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
fast or slow depending on the speed of

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.819 
fast or slow depending on the speed of
the<00:03:24.819> cars<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.239> said<00:03:25.509> semba<00:03:26.290> each<00:03:26.470> time<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
the cars I said semba each time the

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.249 
the cars I said semba each time the
camera<00:03:27.189> encounter<00:03:27.759> a<00:03:27.790> person<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.659> human<00:03:28.840> being

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:29.259 
camera encounter a person a human being

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.129 
camera encounter a person a human being
in<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.530> street<00:03:29.949> walking<00:03:30.370> by<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:31.479> camera<00:03:31.900> as

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
in the street walking by the camera as

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.969 
in the street walking by the camera as
go<00:03:32.620> down<00:03:33.389> or<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.659> image<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.049> slow<00:03:35.229> down<00:03:35.439> then

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
go down or the image is slow down then

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.890 
go down or the image is slow down then
in<00:03:36.099> some<00:03:36.340> ways<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:36.729> for<00:03:37.359> me<00:03:37.449> it's<00:03:37.599> like<00:03:37.659> the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
in some ways it's for me it's like the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.409 
in some ways it's for me it's like the
landscape<00:03:38.470> versus<00:03:38.979> human<00:03:39.759> presence<00:03:40.000> and

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
landscape versus human presence and

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.050 
landscape versus human presence and
usually<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.959> always<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:42.069> landscape<00:03:42.280> as

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
usually we always see the landscape as

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.909 
usually we always see the landscape as
of<00:03:43.239> still<00:03:43.479> images<00:03:43.569> you<00:03:44.319> know<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:44.650> kind<00:03:44.859> of

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
of still images you know it's kind of

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.059 
of still images you know it's kind of
very<00:03:44.979> much<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.609> I<00:03:45.729> and<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.659> humans<00:03:47.290> always<00:03:47.709> or

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
very much as I and the humans always or

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.369 
very much as I and the humans always or
any<00:03:48.220> movement<00:03:48.430> moving<00:03:48.970> around<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.259> in

any movement moving around and here in

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.809 
any movement moving around and here in
some<00:03:50.590> ways<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:50.979> the<00:03:51.099> other<00:03:51.220> way<00:03:51.400> around<00:03:51.430> you

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
some ways it's the other way around you

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.149

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.320 
video for me it seems to be the perfect
medium<00:05:08.720> because<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.530> can<00:05:09.770> actually<00:05:10.090> set<00:05:11.090> so

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
medium because you can actually set so

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.450 
medium because you can actually set so
much<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.960> because<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.890> top<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.100> juice

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
much and because on the top of juice

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.790 
much and because on the top of juice
filming<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.180> can<00:05:14.360> also<00:05:14.480> play<00:05:14.990> with<00:05:15.230> a<00:05:15.350> space

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
filming you can also play with a space

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.870 
filming you can also play with a space
in<00:05:16.190> installation<00:05:17.090> always<00:05:18.080> monitors<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.980> and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
in installation always monitors and and

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.460 
in installation always monitors and and
you<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.210> actually<00:05:20.360> create<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.840> scriptural

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470
