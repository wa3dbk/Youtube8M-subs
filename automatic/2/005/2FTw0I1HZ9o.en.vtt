00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome to chapter 4 of this 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 special of greatness 85 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
 in this chapter we are going to discuss the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.269
 robberies that will be produced in large photo 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 5 remember that you can review all the 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.980
 chapters of this special video 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.460
 response even if you can go to the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.199
 page of our channel and to see the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.779
 videos that are coming up since yesterday 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
 from chapter 1 to this if not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
 you want to miss any big data 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 picture 5 you can review the videos 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.940
 robberies and is that the big robberies the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.190
 robberies robberies as you want to call it are 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.850
 the true stars of this east 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.280
 game not since these will be repeated as 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
 throughout the whole story 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.079
 rockstar has already confirmed some of its 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.379
 elements from the planning of a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.840
 simple robbery until hiring 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 other members for our band in 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.149
 more complex heists and is as already 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 has advanced rockstar to the members of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.730
 the specialized company that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 witnessed the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.600
 the show on playstation3 of this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.630
 game 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 and this of the assaults is going to be 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 totally different than any game 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 of the saga since what is the story 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.630
 of the game will not have a single moment 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.159
 stellar or a super final not during 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.549
 the whole game everything is going to have 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.360
 importance and any robbery any 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.990
 Stole 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.149
 it will have to be planned in a way 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.100
 primordial to say it in some way 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.690
 these robberies will be the best way to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 be able to get large amounts of 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.420
 money and although in the demonstration only 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.610
 there may be a robbery yes that has 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.869
 confirmed to rockstar that there will be everything 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.240
 kind of situations varieties and that not 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.539
 we worry because there will be 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.360
 very much then variety in this sense 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.220
 and we must highlight, for example, what 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
 that could be seen in the robbery of the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.310
 show everyone because I'm 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.049
 has a little spoiler nothing that we 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.360
 go fuck the game but you are 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.520
 warned and is that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020
 as I said before planning a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.190
 binge eating big picture 5 is going to be 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 primordial and we can decide where 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 place each element that we will use from 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 the vehicle in which we 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.840
 we use to track to do that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.300
 I rob the masks as I have already 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.520
 said in the previous news there will be a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.210
 great variety of elements that we can 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.650
 buy even weapons and weapons 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.810
 peepholes already said previous news 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 there will be many possibilities of 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 personalization in this robbery of the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.310
 show good what they compare 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.440
 many web pages with the movie 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.250
 hits is not a very scene 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
 cinematographic 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.590
 and there will be a great assault on a great 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.450
 explosion will play defend against the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.840
 police that of course is right away will come 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.090
 to see what the fuck is going on and in this 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.490
 vision we can exchange in the demo 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.020
 you saw how you could swap between 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.060
 the three characters 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.270
 for example franklin was in charge of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.700
 repel the first units that were going 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.410
 arriving for example michael was 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.990
 helping to shoot from two other 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.090
 shooting angle and trevor was 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.720
 exercising as a sniper from a 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.580
 roof to a nearby rooftop after 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.220
 more special forces arrived 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.670
 helicopters and God's brown 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.800
 and each character had to readjust from 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.520
 somehow its role to be able 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.470
 fight them for example trevor used a 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.440
 rocket launchers to beat the helicopter and 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.430
 you have to go thinking what situation 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.160
 to catch in that moment to be able 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.560
 take the robbery to a good port and that is 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.920
 The truth is that when planning 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.060
 the blow is very important for example 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.760
 when it 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.909
 hide for example the car the truck 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.689
 or whatever we are using in 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:09.150
 a little traveled area since we have 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.439
 that destroy the evidence of the crime not 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.769
 for example with a detonation a 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.329
 explosion that does not weave any marks and 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.639
 Of course we will have to do it without 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.579
 get attention because everyone is attentive 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.430
 and this is news now if pedestrians 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.310
 alert the police if they hear any 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.430
 suspicious explosion and this leaves me 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.200
 hypeado very much because it gives you still 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.220
 more an incredible realism 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.530
 what is the essence of the game and is that 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.200
 if a small-scale attack seems 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.780
 simple imagine doing a heist much 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.780
 bigger because it's like a bank a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.600
 jewelry and even casinos we will have 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.120
 many options according to rockstar's 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.610
 customization we can choose many 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.330
 vehicles where to put ourselves as I have 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.880
 said before and the novelty would be to be able 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.120
 hire other members of our 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.510
 band to be able to buy that we can 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.250
 help carry out that robbery and if it 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.590
 He says it is also commented 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.020
 how many more we use those members 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.360
 if we call them back these 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.260
 secondary characters will go catching 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.150
 well, certain skills that also 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.150
 as an evolution of the character will go 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.190
 evolving in its characteristics 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.370
 each one will have some 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.410
 important and this is quite 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.230
 interesting because if you bet on a 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.450
 bully and evolve it to the maximum then you 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.880
 can play a pretty important role 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.969
 for the trio the rule not even though I say 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.699
 so 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.729
 it really paints very well as 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.649
 I want to focus rockstar, you have to be 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.039
 you have to plan the robberies very well 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:56.019
 as you want to do it or you can 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.209
 use a lot of vehicles there will be no 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:06:00.759
 a story like that or you can do 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:03.669
 do an equal robbery for a motorcycle that 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.369
 with a truck that with a bus by 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.219
 example you have to try to plan 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:11.819
 I'll tell you where you want to put each 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:15.159
 vehicle and it really is 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.610
 spectacular and good to comment more 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:21.219
 Well, we also have to choose the plan 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.860
 of attack as I am indicating we can 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:26.829
 opt for example by going to brute force 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.919
 total or if we want to be stealthy to the most 

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:32.709
 pure style splinter cell this too 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.599
 It must be said that it will affect the loot 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:37.449
 final the collection that we can charge 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:41.229
 for doing that robbery well 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.749
 that we can say more then in the 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.749
 aspect of hiring other members 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:48.849
 for our band the door opens 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:52.659
 according to rockstar commented that 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:57.789
 we can carry out robberies then to the most 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:59.740
 ie pure style is seen or good 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:02.589
 rockstar said put is more for example 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.419
 'ocean's eleven' by saying 12 members of 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:07.059
 band we can plan it as we want 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.189
 and the conclusion of all this the 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:12.159
 final conclusion and not to roll up 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:13.060
 more is that any robbery any 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.400
 Stole 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.099
 we can plan it to the most 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.620
 minimal detail and this gives a few options 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:23.589
 of incredible customization that 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:28.150
 I really want to take control 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:29.349
 and they play and show everyone everything 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.580
 what can be done because really 

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:34.960
 is infinite infinite possibilities like that 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.779
 that I hope you're liking all 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.300
 this information really I do it for 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:42.099
 try to show all the information that 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.480
 it has been given that the execution of 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:45.420
 many web pages 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.500
 and I'm doing a little synthesis 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.320
 forgive if I have repeated myself in some 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.180
 but I think that every moment 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.460
 given the information that he played so 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.980
 you know if you want another chapter of 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.380
 this special big photo 5 you only have 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.570
 to give like favorites guys commented 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.100
 which is very important and very many 

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.480
 heartfelt thanks for the support shown 

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.480
 until next time
