00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.949
 the minister gelmini reacts to the criticisms and the demonstrations of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.550
 plaza these days stating that the protesters are a few thousand while 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.119
 the students who support the decree itself would be many more 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.710
 meanwhile in Rome in front of Palazzo Madama they gather to protest both students 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.719
 leftists that right-wing students also the sympathizers of the Italy of values 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.219
 are associated with disputes many of the candles are occupied and the entrance to the 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.690
 journalists are prevented students motivate the decision by saying that they do not 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.460
 we want to be instrumentalized by the world of information in the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.890
 university the wisdom of Rome students draw attention 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.620
 limiting myself in public this would keep on symbolizing the end that it could do 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 the request was stripped of the funds aura of letters 17 o'clock stands for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.190
 starting the event we are absolutely for meritocracy and 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.490
 we would also like the government to dress for this 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.400
 which seems to be focusing above all on the legitimacy hey legality of 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.270
 assumptions and therefore in this fashion part 7 Italian university on those 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550
 unnecessary waste 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.330
 which are also offensive to all those other professor workers 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.110
 imprimis 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.240
 the students do their job with granita and compassion 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.900
 who want to continue studying in all serenity we listen to francesco 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.710
 Easter students from the Freedom Students Association have launched one 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 petition fool free newspaper 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.150
 to support the work of the minister gelmini but above all to defend the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 right to study students 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.370
 that your mind is goodbye today 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.920
 I quote for example what happened to Federico the second of Naples during 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.100
 an assembly the saga there have been dismissed congruency of the collectives and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 in fossanova meanwhile the gelmini reacts stating that the students who 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.370
 they protest a few thousand and those that instead agree on the work of the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.970
 Government is much more 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.050
 there is also no intention to withdraw the decree but the door is 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.770
 open to dialogue to improve school reform together 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.750
