00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
off and ideas could see it's very

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.400 
off and ideas could see it's very
precise<00:04:47.300> just<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:47.900> i'm<00:04:48.050> going<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.260> go<00:04:48.380> ahead

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
precise just so i'm going to go ahead

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.890 
precise just so i'm going to go ahead
with<00:04:48.890> another<00:04:49.400> brush<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.330> didn't<00:04:50.780> have

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
with another brush and this didn't have

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.960 
with another brush and this didn't have
any<00:04:51.080> eyeshadow<00:04:51.200> on<00:04:51.680> i'm<00:04:51.890> simply<00:04:52.730> just

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
any eyeshadow on i'm simply just

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.180 
any eyeshadow on i'm simply just
blending<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.720> sides<00:04:53.990> away<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:54.650> looks<00:04:54.920> a

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
blending the sides away so it looks a

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.080 
blending the sides away so it looks a
little<00:04:55.790> bit<00:04:55.970> more<00:04:56.150> faded<00:04:56.480> into<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.560> eyes<00:04:58.090> so

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
little bit more faded into the eyes so

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.120 
little bit more faded into the eyes so
of<00:04:59.240> course<00:04:59.390> we<00:04:59.600> can<00:04:59.720> i<00:04:59.810> forget<00:05:00.140> about<00:05:00.290> mascara

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
of course we can i forget about mascara

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.990 
of course we can i forget about mascara
