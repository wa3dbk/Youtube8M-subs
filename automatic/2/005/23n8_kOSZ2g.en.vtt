00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.660
 this object is what remains of a very massive star collapsed on

 itself, in the final phase of a few evolution, the current theories break through 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.610
 blacks do not allow to establish with certainty how small they can be 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 their size but this discovery makes it possible to get very close to it 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.230
 answer 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.290
 as soon as discovered a two-star system so bizarre as to seem a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.220
 unique here is that another very similar to 13 is immediately identified 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.210
 millions of light years from us astronomers have identified 2 stars 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.140
 so close together to share some of the material that makes them up like this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 to take on the whole a shape that resembles that of a peanut but you 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.150
 in this case, if the company is not an isolated case in the light of this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.730
 in fact an accurate survey of the data of was made 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.520
 archive and here is the surprise at just 200 30 light years from us there is another 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
 similar system, however, that at the time it was cataloged had not been 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.320
 correctly identified and its particularity had not jumped 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.489
 eye 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.430
 the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars seems unstoppable 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.209
 ten other extrasolar planets identified in these days go to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.920
 add to the list of the now almost 300 identified in the early 1990s 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.730
 today the result is the result of an international collaboration

 he calls super wasp nessi villa which means looking for planets up wide 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.319
 scale and with these all from the editorial staff of urania a good continuation euronics 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.290
