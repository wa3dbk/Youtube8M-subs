there you can see lines this is probably
my<00:02:12.700> least<00:02:12.849> favorite<00:02:13.239> way<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.360> applying<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.099> but

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
my least favorite way of applying it but

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.570 
my least favorite way of applying it but
I<00:02:15.459> mean<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.420> works<00:02:16.599> for<00:02:16.750> some<00:02:16.810> people<00:02:17.230> so

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
I mean it works for some people so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.820 
I mean it works for some people so
that's<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.180> then<00:02:19.450> another<00:02:19.870> way<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
that's that and then another way is you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.660 
that's that and then another way is you
can<00:02:20.980> use<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:22.140> Beauty<00:02:23.140> Blender<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.580> is
