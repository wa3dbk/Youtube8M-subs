00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.430
 modern metropolis desire to be in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 trend and look the latest 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.310
 fashion is often like a locust destroys 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.100
 on its way everything is brutal and also 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 sometimes and nissan cars 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.260
 x-trail has always been functional and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.199
 passable angular shapes attached to him 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
 masculinity the third generation of this 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 the crossover has changed dramatically by 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.489
 least externally from straight lines not 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.829
 a trace remains as well as from 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.519
 charisma predecessor because new 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.780
 x-trail has become very similar to qashqai 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.789
 perhaps extreme lovers 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.889
 adventures and all the brutal such 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.909
 changes don't really like it 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.159
 similar design 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.329
 those who follow modern genius will appreciate 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.870
 and does not like cubism 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.699
 and such today the majority of people 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.479
 copy their younger brother's x-trail and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.359
 in the interior 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.690
 and everything is so identical that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.810
 It's time to look for the very 10 differences that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 do ubiquitous unification with another 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 hand ergonomic quality 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.860
 materials and ease of use of special 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.200
 claims we do not have and that's what 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 really impressive so is the list 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 options even as standard 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.940
 not to mention the top version of which 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.790
 we test the truth something which freaks at 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 we have a mixed reaction 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 for example coasters with function 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.030
 cooling and heating are unlikely to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.870
 Substantially cool or heat your 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 drinks through tiny air ducts 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.070
 nissanconnect 20 multimedia system 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.620
 seems to suggest having navigation 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 but for some reason it does not work in some places 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.030
 so and not at all clear penny 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.540
 saving another very interesting option 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.920
 we found in the new x-trail 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.430
 it means that if you 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.430
 accidentally suddenly when lifting glass 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.020
 put your hand in that glass automatically 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.750
 goes down so as not to hurt your 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 limbs but the nuance is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.600
 what is auto mode u 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 window only have you with 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.660
 driver's side in the rest of such 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.920
 no mode 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.540
 this other hand window is better not to meddle 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 generally without a certain degree of irony 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.190
 treat some options just 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.170
 impossible but that doesn't mean the car 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.470
 bad just once again worth thinking 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.210
 before ordering this or that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.730
 complete set plus can be attributed 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.500
 a good supply of space in the cabin I'm 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.540
 including the back seat 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 and the merit is not only 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.070
 extended wheelbase rear sofa 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.500
 new nissan x-trail may not 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.360
 Offers especially unnecessary amenities for 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.460
 passengers such as a separate unit 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.630
 climate control or remote control 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.150
 multimedia system 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.490
 but nissan sheep did very well 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.590
 rear seat adjustment system 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.350
 There is, firstly, you can adjust the back 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.570
 on the angle of slope there are three positions that 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.470
 very well and the same can be 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.140
 push back 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.910
 back seat all the way back if you 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.020
 need more leg room she 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.210
 it really forms here 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.930
 impressive but if you need more 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.240
 trunk space then you push back 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.950
 the seat is almost up to the front that is 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.720
 thus regulated and space 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.620
 at your convenience, you can say everything 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.959
 occasions 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.180
 electric tailgate and 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.670
 the sensor gives access to quite 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.350
 volume and functional space 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.250
 which if necessary is easy 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.250
 transformed 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 slightly different behavior now 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.260
 x-trail and on the road immediately felt 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.990
 that his main element is a city 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.300
 the suspension has become a little less energy intensive 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.130
 which is not good off-road but 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.830
 on the pavement the crossover has become more 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.110
 collected and predictable there is in this 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 merit and smart all-wheel drive with 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.650
 impressive list of electronic 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.060
 lotions 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.160
 true tangible difference in behavior 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.860
 cars will most likely be seen on 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.830
 slippery coating on wet asphalt 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.140
 the differences are not so significant but here are 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.760
 asphalt such a four-wheel drive will be very 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.870
 is useful 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.510
 certainly within limits 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.520
 crossover and ground clearance in 21 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.959
 centimeter 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.890
 the only thing that spoils the picture slightly 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.430
 dirt control 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.410
 this is regular tires 144 horsepower 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.390
 power is certainly not prohibitive but 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.980
 pair with a good variator petrol 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.320
 dvushka allows x-trail 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.810
 feel pretty confident and in 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.030
 city â€‹â€‹and on the highway besides 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.980
 confidence to the driver and passengers give 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.650
 numerous security systems 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.540
 this crossover really protect yourself 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.910
 these systems cannot 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.100
 The new nissan x-trail machine is definitely 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.910
 Technological me many different systems 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.400
 security 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.980
 but there is one moment the key is at 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.030
 I got a car in my hands but 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.300
 principle on it you can go without a key 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.160
 where to where so what do you understand 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.510
 running a car unattended 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.460
 leave is not necessary and so in the end 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.170
 previous x-trail possessed a certain 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.530
 charisma and originality 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.200
 he liked those who love adventure 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.330
 hunting fishing and stuff like that in 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.040
 conditions of tough competition new 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.020
 generation had to develop with 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.840
 considering the tastes of the main majority 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.310
 drivers 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 the car was very interesting 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.870
 albeit ambiguous and let smooth 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.390
 lines deprived of the usual crossover 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.590
 brutality peculiar character 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.590
 he still stayed
