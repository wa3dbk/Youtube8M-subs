in it but for the most part it's it's
kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.690> basic<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.190> use

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
kind of basic because I don't really use

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.270

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
kind of just they're not forget to be a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.500 
kind of just they're not forget to be a
little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.489> interesting<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.210> really

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
little bit more interesting not really

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
little bit more interesting not really
because<00:00:45.629> he<00:00:45.780> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> doesn't<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
