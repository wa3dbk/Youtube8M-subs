healthy<00:01:45.010> mix<00:01:45.220> all<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:45.490> time<00:01:45.730> but<00:01:46.270> I've

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
healthy mix all the time but I've

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.760 
healthy mix all the time but I've
actually<00:01:46.510> converted<00:01:47.140> over<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.560> now

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
actually converted over to this now

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.590 
actually converted over to this now
because<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.340> lot<00:01:48.490> better<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.030> lasts<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.450> lot

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
because it's a lot better it lasts a lot

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.260 
because it's a lot better it lasts a lot
longer<00:01:49.920> why<00:01:50.920> i<00:01:50.950> love<00:01:51.160> about<00:01:51.280> this<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.090> two

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
longer why i love about this is it's two

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.390 
longer why i love about this is it's two
products<00:01:52.720> in<00:01:52.810> one<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.620> get<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> foundation

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
products in one so you get a foundation

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.220 
products in one so you get a foundation
in<00:01:54.460> here<00:01:54.730> but<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.060> also<00:01:55.270> get<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.630> primer<00:01:55.960> built

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
in here but you also get a primer built

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.440 
in here but you also get a primer built
in<00:01:56.440> now<00:01:57.040> normally<00:01:57.280> when<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.090> get<00:01:58.240> two

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
in now normally when you get two

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.240 
in now normally when you get two
products<00:01:58.900> in<00:01:58.990> 1<00:01:59.170> i'm<00:01:59.440> kind<00:01:59.920> of<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.100> bit

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
products in 1 i'm kind of a bit

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.920 
products in 1 i'm kind of a bit
skeptical<00:02:00.700> because<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.180> kind<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.480> think<00:02:01.630> well

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
skeptical because I kind of think well

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.750 
skeptical because I kind of think well
if<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:02.680> two<00:02:02.830> products<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.340> one<00:02:03.490> it's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
if it's two products in one it's

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.120 
if it's two products in one it's
probably<00:02:04.000> okay<00:02:04.420> you're<00:02:04.630> doing<00:02:04.750> both<00:02:05.020> things

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
probably okay you're doing both things

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.279 
probably okay you're doing both things
but<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.280> not<00:02:06.520> amazing<00:02:07.000> at<00:02:07.390> doing<00:02:07.450> both<00:02:08.050> at

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
but it's not amazing at doing both at

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.889 
but it's not amazing at doing both at
the<00:02:08.379> same<00:02:08.560> time<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.340> using<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.879> and<00:02:10.539> I

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the same time and using this and I

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.390 
the same time and using this and I
thought<00:02:11.050> what<00:02:11.290> I'll<00:02:11.440> do<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.860> I'll<00:02:11.950> test<00:02:12.220> it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
thought what I'll do is I'll test it

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.979 
thought what I'll do is I'll test it
without<00:02:12.519> a<00:02:12.700> primer<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.360> I'll<00:02:13.450> test<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:13.959> a

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
without a primer and I'll test it with a

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.410 
without a primer and I'll test it with a
primer<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.620> see<00:02:14.800> if<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.400> needed<00:02:15.849> if<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.209> makes

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
primer to see if it's needed if it makes

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.809 
primer to see if it's needed if it makes
a<00:02:16.599> difference<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.739> really<00:02:18.040> didn't<00:02:18.580> which

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
a difference and it really didn't which

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.009 
a difference and it really didn't which
I'm<00:02:19.000> really<00:02:19.300> shocked<00:02:19.510> about<00:02:19.659> because

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
I'm really shocked about because

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.170 
I'm really shocked about because
normally<00:02:20.409> I<00:02:20.440> use<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> Smashbox<00:02:21.310> primer<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:22.120> I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
normally I use the Smashbox primer or I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.449 
normally I use the Smashbox primer or I
use<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> Porefessional<00:02:23.440> by<00:02:23.500> benefit<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.430> I

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
use the Porefessional by benefit so I

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.739 
use the Porefessional by benefit so I
thought<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.849> those<00:02:24.940> two<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.510> good

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
thought that those two really good

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.179 
thought that those two really good
primers<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.379> are<00:02:26.439> going<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.829> make<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
primers they are going to make the

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.979 
primers they are going to make the
biggest<00:02:27.340> difference<00:02:27.519> within<00:02:28.420> without<00:02:28.749> using

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
biggest difference within without using

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:29.250 
biggest difference within without using
it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.869 
it
because<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.769> quite<00:02:29.950> large<00:02:30.220> pores<00:02:30.549> around

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
because I have quite large pores around

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.199 
because I have quite large pores around
my<00:02:31.090> nose<00:02:31.150> area<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.250> honestly<00:02:33.310> say<00:02:33.579> this

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
my nose area and I can honestly say this

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.210 
my nose area and I can honestly say this
combats<00:02:34.780> them<00:02:35.019> really<00:02:35.500> really<00:02:35.709> well<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.129> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
combats them really really well so the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.250 
combats them really really well so the
fact<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.579> get<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> primer<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.360> here<00:02:37.569> for

fact that you get a primer in here for
the<00:02:38.349> same<00:02:38.500> price<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:39.189> a<00:02:39.220> fantastic<00:02:39.750> benefit

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the same price is a fantastic benefit

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.440 
the same price is a fantastic benefit

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
quite sure how it does that because

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.770 
quite sure how it does that because
maybe<00:03:00.730> it's<00:03:00.939> because<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.359> Debbie<00:03:01.629> matte

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
maybe it's because it's Debbie matte

maybe it's because it's Debbie matte
finish<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.260> makes<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.590> look<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.829> your<00:03:03.040> skin

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
but better because Demi Matt means not

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.530 
but better because Demi Matt means not
quite<00:03:05.950> mad<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.579> not<00:03:06.730> quite<00:03:07.000> Juhi<00:03:07.269> it's

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
somewhere in between it looks like bare

somewhere in between it looks like bare
skin<00:03:10.000> which<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:10.810> definitely<00:03:11.349> does<00:03:11.530> look

skin which this definitely does look
