 the league of the wind are actually five 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.840
 leagues until you get to the last one that would be 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 the dragon's league 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.849
 after being well in the league 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:11.200
 the league of the line with the and it comes in the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.060
 last the last league that in this case 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.080

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.590

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.450
 there are verses and Robert serves or does not serve 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.569

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.840

 removing as the races go 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.050
 I know very well the truth 100% of the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.849
 game because I did not play it for long 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.099
 time just a few less but 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.419
 It seems to be something good and something like very 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.070
 good even though they have the screen 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.090
 vertically yes yes I do what 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.640
 it caught my attention and I do not know 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.650

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.050
