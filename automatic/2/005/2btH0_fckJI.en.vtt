00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
but it isn't as good as what I always

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.790 
but it isn't as good as what I always
thought<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.410> because<00:01:56.620> when

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
thought it was going to be because when

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.250 
thought it was going to be because when
you<00:01:56.950> switch<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.670> your<00:01:58.540> alien<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.140> you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
you switch it to your alien that you

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.230 
you switch it to your alien that you
want<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:03.100> can<00:02:03.280> push<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.580> down<00:02:03.760> like<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.060> and

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
want you can push it down like that and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.120 
want you can push it down like that and
it<00:02:04.390> makes<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.930> noise<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.440> thought<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.010> was

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
it makes that noise I thought it was

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.210 
it makes that noise I thought it was
going<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.460> make<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:07.390> noise<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.080> alien<00:02:08.710> you

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
going to make the noise of the alien you

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.670 
going to make the noise of the alien you
have<00:02:09.400> selected<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.900> doesn't<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.440> only

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
have selected but it doesn't the only

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
have selected but it doesn't the only
two<00:02:11.860> things<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:15.190> those<00:02:16.030> two

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
two things you do get all those two

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.310 
two things you do get all those two
sounds<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.770> get<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> spin<00:02:18.490> noise<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.330> you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
sounds so you get the spin noise and you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080 
sounds so you get the spin noise and you
get<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.650> push<00:02:23.950> noise<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.430> well<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
get that push noise as well so it is a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.510 
get that push noise as well so it is a
little<00:02:25.420> bit<00:02:25.540> disappointing<00:02:26.260> guys<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.740> really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
little bit disappointing guys I really

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.920 
little bit disappointing guys I really
did<00:02:27.670> think<00:02:27.910> we're<00:02:28.210> going<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> voices

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
did think we're going to get the voices

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.190 
did think we're going to get the voices
of<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.410> aliens<00:02:29.800> when<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.790> switched<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.020> and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
of the aliens when we switched it and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.630 
of the aliens when we switched it and
pushed<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:35.740> tried<00:02:36.010> lots<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.580> different

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
pushed it I have tried lots of different

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.520 
pushed it I have tried lots of different
ways<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.300> instructions<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.960> don't<00:02:38.260> say

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
ways of the instructions that don't say

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.930 
ways of the instructions that don't say
anything<00:02:39.070> more<00:02:39.250> than<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.490> and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
anything more than that and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.700 
anything more than that and
unfortunately<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.800> think<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> all<00:02:43.210> we<00:02:43.390> get

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
unfortunately I think that is all we get

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.040 
unfortunately I think that is all we get
with<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.890> Omnitrix<00:02:45.340> AI<00:02:45.900> unfortunately<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
with this Omnitrix AI unfortunately so

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.530

it<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> little<00:02:50.650> lacking<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.090> gives

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240
