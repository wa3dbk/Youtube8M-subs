Francis<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> news<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.240> provides

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
Francis in the news and he provides

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.910 
Francis in the news and he provides
plenty<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.130> material<00:01:38.930> every<00:01:39.930> day<00:01:40.079> he<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.650> say

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
plenty of material every day he will say

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.600 
plenty of material every day he will say
something<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.619> world<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
something and I think the world got a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
something and I think the world got a
sense<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.560> different

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
sense of that this was a very different

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.120 
sense of that this was a very different
very<00:01:47.640> human<00:01:48.180> very<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> earth<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.439> very

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
very human very down to earth and very

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060 
very human very down to earth and very
funny<00:01:50.750> occasionally<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.740> everybody

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
funny occasionally I think everybody

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.090 
funny occasionally I think everybody
recalls<00:01:53.490> his<00:01:53.670> statement<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.360> bishops

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
recalls his statement that bishops

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.880 
recalls his statement that bishops

had<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> little

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
had to think about that for a little

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.810 
had to think about that for a little
while<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:01.229> cartoons

certainly cartoon images in in that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.190 
certainly cartoon images in in that
statement<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> many<00:02:06.149> other<00:02:06.360> things<00:02:06.689> he's<00:02:06.960> I

statement and many other things he's I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
statement and many other things he's I
think<00:02:07.799> he's<00:02:08.099> told<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> whole<00:02:08.759> church<00:02:09.119> to

think he's told the whole church to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
think he's told the whole church to
lighten<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.679> was<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.459> any

trepidation at all at
for<00:02:13.980> creating<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.240> any<00:02:15.420> sense

for creating this was there any sense

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.920 
for creating this was there any sense
that<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.860> might<00:02:17.070> come<00:02:17.670> off<00:02:17.700> irreverent<00:02:18.660> or

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that you might come off irreverent or

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
that you might come off irreverent or
maybe<00:02:19.440> Pope<00:02:19.800> Francis<00:02:20.220> would<00:02:20.400> not<00:02:20.550> accept<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
maybe Pope Francis would not accept the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.370 
maybe Pope Francis would not accept the
fact<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.840> he<00:02:21.960> was<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.440> comic<00:02:23.130> strip<00:02:24.380> well

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
fact that he was a comic strip well

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.930 
fact that he was a comic strip well
first<00:02:25.710> thing<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.980> tell<00:02:26.190> people<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
first thing I tell people is that this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.780 
first thing I tell people is that this
is<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> comic<00:02:27.780> strip<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.770> cartoon<00:02:29.010> version

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
is a comic strip it's a cartoon version

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.540 
is a comic strip it's a cartoon version
it's<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> real<00:02:30.690> pope<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:32.250> I'm

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
it's not the real pope and so I'm

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.530 
it's not the real pope and so I'm
creating<00:02:33.210> both<00:02:33.660> out<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:33.990> my<00:02:35.420> observation<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
creating both out of my observation of

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.990 
creating both out of my observation of
the<00:02:36.750> real<00:02:37.020> Francis<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.890> my<00:02:38.070> imagination<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the real Francis and my imagination a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.540 
the real Francis and my imagination a
little<00:02:39.690> world<00:02:40.110> full<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> comic<00:02:41.310> strip

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
little world full of comic strip

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.180 
little world full of comic strip
characters<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.440> I'm<00:02:43.650> trying<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> hit<00:02:44.160> on

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
characters and I'm trying to hit on

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.300 
characters and I'm trying to hit on
themes<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.240> authentic<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> Pope<00:02:46.710> my

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
themes that are authentic to the Pope my

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.690 
themes that are authentic to the Pope my
cartoons<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:48.000> don't<00:02:48.180> come<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:49.700> entirely

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
cartoons just don't come out of entirely

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880 
cartoons just don't come out of entirely
out<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.240> imagination<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.290> watch<00:02:52.620> him

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
out of my imagination but I watch him

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
out of my imagination but I watch him
and<00:02:53.550> I'm<00:02:53.790> trying<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.209> at<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> underlying

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480

and I'm trying to get at the underlying
values<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.790> are<00:02:56.910> bringing<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
values that I think are bringing a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.620 
values that I think are bringing a
certain<00:02:57.720> joy<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.320> people<00:02:59.150> at<00:03:00.150> seeing<00:03:00.510> a

theology haha heard in a cage and he's
singing<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.009> the<00:04:37.099> Pope<00:04:37.280> realizes<00:04:38.090> there's

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
singing and so the Pope realizes there's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.460 
singing and so the Pope realizes there's
a<00:04:38.360> connection<00:04:38.629> here<00:04:38.900> he<00:04:38.960> gives<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.259> and<00:04:39.379> he

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
a connection here he gives up and he

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.809 
a connection here he gives up and he
lets<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.800> bird<00:04:39.979> out<00:04:40.159> it<00:04:40.370> flies<00:04:40.580> out<00:04:40.789> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it sets the tone that i'm looking for

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.040 
it sets the tone that i'm looking for
that<00:04:51.949> that<00:04:52.280> sense<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.819> that<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:53.840> church<00:04:54.020> is

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that that sense of that the church is

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.249 
that that sense of that the church is
beginning<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.680> breathe<00:04:55.039> again<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:57.020> there's

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
beginning to breathe again that there's

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.559 
beginning to breathe again that there's
a<00:04:57.349> release<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.979> spirit<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.669> it's<00:04:59.300> time<00:04:59.539> to

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
a release of the spirit and it's time to

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.350 
a release of the spirit and it's time to
exhale<00:05:00.259> and<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:01.400> this<00:05:01.520> Pope<00:05:01.789> is<00:05:01.969> going<00:05:02.240> to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
exhale and that this Pope is going to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.089 
exhale and that this Pope is going to
lead<00:05:03.289> us<00:05:03.319> into<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:04.009> different<00:05:04.430> perception<00:05:04.789> of
