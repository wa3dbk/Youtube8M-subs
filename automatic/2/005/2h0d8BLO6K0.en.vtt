00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
do zoom different this doesn't do a very

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.260 
do zoom different this doesn't do a very
good<00:00:59.550> job

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
good job

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.080

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
this only has one you turn it on you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
this only has one you turn it on you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
ones real and here's the difference in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.039 
ones real and here's the difference in
the<00:01:15.750> lenses<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.520> cheap<00:01:17.990> this<00:01:18.990> is

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the lenses this is really cheap this is

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.950 
the lenses this is really cheap this is
really<00:01:19.530> well<00:01:19.710> made<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:20.700> thing<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> noticed

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
really well made another thing I noticed

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
really well made another thing I noticed
the<00:01:22.049> real<00:01:22.229> ones<00:01:22.409> always<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> sticker<00:01:23.220> on

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the real ones always have the sticker on

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.359 
the real ones always have the sticker on
fake<00:01:23.850> ones<00:01:24.060> didn't<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fake ones didn't but there's just a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
fake ones didn't but there's just a
difference<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.420> cap<00:01:28.049> quality<00:01:28.530> too<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
difference in the cap quality too and I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
difference in the cap quality too and I
don't<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.549> how<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.180> showing<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.479> on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
don't know how well it's showing up on

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.010 
don't know how well it's showing up on
camera

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
camera

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
camera
but<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.040> definitely<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.490> parent<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
but it it's definitely a parent with the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.920 
but it it's definitely a parent with the
eye<00:01:33.350> this<00:01:34.350> weighs<00:01:34.740> almost<00:01:35.130> nothing<00:01:35.930> where

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
eye this weighs almost nothing where

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
eye this weighs almost nothing where
this<00:01:37.079> feels<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.950> made<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.400> heavy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
this feels like it's made out of heavy

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
this feels like it's made out of heavy
aluminum<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.329> feels<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.869> made<00:01:40.020> out

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
aluminum this feels like it's made out

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.710 
aluminum this feels like it's made out
of<00:01:40.200> pop-can<00:01:40.890> aluminum<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of pop-can aluminum so there is a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980 
of pop-can aluminum so there is a
difference<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:45.360> body<00:01:45.600> construction

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
difference there the body construction

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
difference there the body construction
is<00:01:46.530> fairly<00:01:47.399> similar<00:01:47.790> except<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.960> weighs

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
is fairly similar except for this weighs

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.460 
is fairly similar except for this weighs
almost<00:01:49.560> nothing<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.759> pretty<00:01:51.000> heavy

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
almost nothing and this is pretty heavy

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.429 
almost nothing and this is pretty heavy
this<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:53.970> heavy<00:01:54.299> aluminum<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this is you know heavy aluminum this is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.030 
this is you know heavy aluminum this is
feels<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.820> old<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> empty<00:01:57.390> pop<00:01:57.570> can

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
feels like I'm old in the empty pop can

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
feels like I'm old in the empty pop can
there's<00:01:59.040> also<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.340> difference<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.390> Cree

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
there's also a difference in the Cree

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.740 
there's also a difference in the Cree

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
quality and the construction around it

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.149 
quality and the construction around it
this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> real<00:02:04.259> one<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.619> course<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:05.070> all

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
this is a real one of course see all

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
this is a real one of course see all

scratched or bumped and just looks rough
in<00:02:13.670> there<00:02:13.819> compared<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> nice<00:02:14.840> smooth

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
in there compared to a nice smooth

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.240 
in there compared to a nice smooth
surface<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.840> end<00:02:18.049> here<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.980> little

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
surface that the end here is a little

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.959 
surface that the end here is a little
different<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:20.180> too<00:02:20.390> much<00:02:20.629> just<00:02:21.640> main<00:02:22.640> thing<00:02:22.879> I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
different not too much just main thing I

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.819 
different not too much just main thing I
noticed<00:02:23.269> was<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.750> here<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.620> had

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
noticed was this right here this had

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.910 
noticed was this right here this had
holes<00:02:25.040> these<00:02:25.370> didn't<00:02:26.109> again<00:02:27.109> this<00:02:27.379> one's<00:02:27.620> real

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
holes these didn't again this one's real

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.940 
holes these didn't again this one's real
this<00:02:28.099> one's<00:02:28.310> fake<00:02:31.030> but<00:02:32.530> there's<00:02:33.530> not<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.680> lot<00:02:33.739> of

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
this one's fake but there's not a lot of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.800 
this one's fake but there's not a lot of
difference<00:02:34.400> right<00:02:34.549> here<00:02:34.819> main<00:02:35.269> spot<00:02:35.599> you'll

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
difference right here main spot you'll

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.229 
difference right here main spot you'll
notice<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.139> difference<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:38.060> tongue<00:02:38.239> caps

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
notice the difference is the tongue caps

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.830 
notice the difference is the tongue caps
here's<00:02:41.239> what<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.659> real<00:02:41.989> toe<00:02:42.200> cap<00:02:42.439> looks<00:02:42.709> like

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
here's what a real toe cap looks like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.839 
here's what a real toe cap looks like
pretty<00:02:44.840> heavy-duty<00:02:45.139> filling<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.700> can

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
pretty heavy-duty filling this I can

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.929 
pretty heavy-duty filling this I can
barely<00:02:47.030> even<00:02:47.180> tell<00:02:47.389> I'm<00:02:47.510> holding<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.939> see

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
barely even tell I'm holding it and see

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.369 
barely even tell I'm holding it and see
the<00:02:50.060> difference<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.480> again<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.049> might<00:02:54.139> just<00:02:54.290> be

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
the difference so again it might just be

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.690 
the difference so again it might just be
the<00:02:54.530> look<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:54.859> draw<00:02:55.099> so<00:02:55.310> I'm<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.459> going<00:02:55.639> to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
the look of a draw so I'm not going to

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.800 
the look of a draw so I'm not going to
tell<00:02:55.849> me<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.120> if<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.269> order<00:02:56.450> one<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.659> these

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
tell me but if you order one of these

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.119 
tell me but if you order one of these
that<00:02:56.989> you're<00:02:57.109> kind<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.349> just<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:58.040> I

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
that you're kind of just going to like I

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.960 
that you're kind of just going to like I
said<00:02:58.340> two<00:02:59.000> out<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.150> four<00:02:59.359> were<00:02:59.540> real<00:03:00.579> again<00:03:01.579> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
said two out of four were real again the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.789 
said two out of four were real again the
real<00:03:02.180> ones<00:03:02.359> have<00:03:02.480> three<00:03:02.780> modes<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.379> fake<00:03:03.590> ones

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
real ones have three modes the fake ones

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.039 
real ones have three modes the fake ones
just<00:03:03.919> have<00:03:04.069> one<00:03:06.849> on<00:03:07.849> another<00:03:08.359> fake<00:03:08.629> one<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.810> had

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
just have one on another fake one I had

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.569 
just have one on another fake one I had
I<00:03:09.079> noticed<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.829> we're<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.129> opposite

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
I noticed that we're the opposite

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.330 
I noticed that we're the opposite
ultrafire<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.540> didn't<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:13.449> the<00:03:15.159> little<00:03:16.159> are

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340

ultrafire it didn't have the little are
the<00:03:16.579> registered<00:03:17.030> logo<00:03:17.389> whereas<00:03:17.900> these<00:03:18.109> do<00:03:18.879> so

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
the registered logo whereas these do so

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.439 
the registered logo whereas these do so
you<00:03:20.299> can't<00:03:20.510> really<00:03:20.629> tell<00:03:20.750> with<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.260> either

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
you can't really tell with that either

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.909 
you can't really tell with that either

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
difference in a real versus fake if I

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:32.199 
difference in a real versus fake if I
can<00:03:28.069> get<00:03:28.159> this<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.340> focus<00:03:28.609> here<00:03:30.940> only<00:03:31.940> does

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's you can just see the quality

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.199 
it's you can just see the quality
difference<00:03:39.129> see<00:03:40.129> if<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.310> get<00:03:40.489> these<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.669> zoom<00:03:40.970> in

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209

so<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:41.959> tell<00:03:43.120> again<00:03:44.120> real<00:03:44.479> fake<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:46.090> then

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
so you can tell again real fake and then

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.640 
so you can tell again real fake and then
the<00:03:47.180> same<00:03:47.389> price<00:03:47.659> that's<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.019> only<00:03:48.199> problem

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
again

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.659 
again
they<00:03:56.389> cost<00:03:56.569> five<00:03:56.840> bucks<00:03:57.169> but<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.250> fake<00:03:58.459> ones

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
they cost five bucks but the fake ones

they cost five bucks but the fake ones
are<00:03:58.790> definitely<00:03:59.209> maybe<00:04:00.049> fifty<00:04:00.620> lumens<00:04:01.069> and

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
are definitely maybe fifty lumens and

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.330
