00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.099
 but I warned in the n abeac in the isi booth 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.300
 focus because so people 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 Of course it's cool to visit the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 stands but has new solutions 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.910
 of not-so- large manufacturers that are 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.100
 equally cool or even more 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.619
 here in isi focus they have a solution 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 based infrared laser 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 that the president has just 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.930
 explain to me that a and 6 is not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.939
 no problem if you have an eye on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.740
 front and what was the home of the guys 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.019
 he has this system that they baptized 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 best friend of the first assistant 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 of the foquista that I want them to stay 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 desperate and without noting the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 photos of this over as you are 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.040
 seeing now have a solution they mount 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.899
 a tripod on the side with a screen one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 incredible reference a great resolution 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 and you have a mouse and simply the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 achievement is to click on the subject 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 first and second plane where he wants 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.399
 and the system saw this laser that I explained 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.379
 via infrared goes and makes focus 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820
 millimetric and you should be 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.789
 Wondering how does this magic 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 incredible happens is not simple but it gives 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.619
 for us to tell the secret here that O 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 head that has infrared laser 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.360
 which can map the subject that is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.580
 in front of him and this meeting in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 ring it is connected in the forum foci or 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
 It's as I said it replaces the bid 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 of the first was conquest of the first 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.500
 assistant actually staying 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.689
 correcting the stop in the hand he uses this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
 head to make the measurement so be 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.130
 he can map via laser beam the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.990
 distances and from there he makes the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 perfect focus because it is aligned 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 in the lens focus ring too much 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.810
 cool huh 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.270
 Of course people already use in Brazil. 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.470
 rgt this television station that has 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.780
 in brazil is already using this technology 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.970
 I do not know if for the novel I know not 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 football but the service is given 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 focus a sensational solution that I 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.110
 I want to have 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.090
 and I will not even ask the price you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.320
 must be very expensive but stay connected 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.329
 share this video and landmarks 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
 friends, we'll be back soon 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.030
 any moment with more news of the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.570
 nbb 2015 a vezena nbb hashtag posta 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.570
 call the guys
