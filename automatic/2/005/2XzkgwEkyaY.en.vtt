00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.100
 Good day dear friends and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 pokora marvel's group subscribers 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 project from the last two video lessons you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.809
 We learned how to prepare your model for 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.240
 print and print it and what's with it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 do after printing that is gluing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 in the same video tutorial I want you 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.490
 tell how to strengthen your 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 a model from isolon is obtained for example but 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 so far that 's such a strength 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.270
 there is not much there are different ways 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.610
 fortifications for example take 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 epoxy resin 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.290
 in the sand sand mix it all up and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.960
 cover izolon it is done in order 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.579
 so that the next layer is applied with 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.390
 fiberglass i.e. epoxy with 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.539
 fiberglass 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 so that fiberglass was for what to catch 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 create adhesion roughly I did 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 completely different we need 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.910
 serpyanka 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.850
 this is such a self-adhesive construction 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.070
 plastic measuring cup 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.049
 cup 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.689
 marker ordinary ordinary scissors and 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.909
 epoxy glue and also thermoglue 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:23.330
 gun what we do take our model 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.330
 take serpyanka tearing off 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.890
 and something like this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890
 glue 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.520
 that is, it should be something like 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.510
 such a place where it departs from our 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.740
 models here you see moves away just take 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:09.550
 thermo glue and very thin layer 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.650
 gun nozzles smear thermo-glue 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.570
 thus she grabs a very strong 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.230
 Here she finished sewing model 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:31.180
 Serpyankoy now my task scissors 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:34.680
 cut off all the excess for example here after 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.830
 You can cut all the excess 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:43.390
 proceed with epoxy glue coating 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.070
 epoxy glue diluted in 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.190
 one to ten ratio 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.080
 Ie on 50 milliliters I can you need 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.650
 use 5 milliliters 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.870
 hardener can of course buy 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.780
 Here is such an epoxy glue to or dp 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.630
 called in the households goods in any worth 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.880
 about 100 rubles but unfortunately after 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.970
 applying two layers of such glue on 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 In the past , I was very pleased with the model and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.350
 so I just donâ€™t use it 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.489
 throw out I found myself in the seller 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.209
 who suggested I buy a kilogram 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.880
 epoxy glue and d 28 not approved 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.000
 very good epoxy glue resin 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.090
 or rather she holds the model very tightly and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.950
 all very good as was complete 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.030
 hardener pap so more ethylene 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.569
 polyamide reading on a piece of paper 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.370
 then take a plastic cup and 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:59.370
 measuring cup pour 50 milliliters 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:59.370
 water mark our water level marker 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.280
 then add another 5 milliliters of water 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:13.420
 it will be with us as if to confirm 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:19.600
 and again mark with a marker everything is simple 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:27.570
 we pour water back about such 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.570
 notches we do over friend 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.880
 we definitely need to wear a glove so 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.730
 how very toxic and getting on 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.620
 his skin is undesirable well even if 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:44.710
 replenish u terrible you won't die from 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.480
 take this brush 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.820
 there are two options you can buy cheap 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.570
 brush and use it as a disposable 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.760
 or immediately after working with glue 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.520
 rinse with warm water 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.310
 glue goes well with brush I'm on again 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.040
 I can take working pro 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.120
 it must be heated before use 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 this is to make it more 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.040
 fluid they were viscous as they were 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.370
 wait a second 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.499
 So 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.499
 everything 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:41.210
 old glove no longer needed now 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.210
 add 5 meters from the driver 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:01.200
 take any wand happen old 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.970
 pencil and mix thoroughly 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.700
 preferably at an angle so that the glue interferes 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.700
 not on the surface but in all its glory 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:46.120
 I paid so much attention 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:51.250
 take a brush to our model and start 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:53.460
 cover so well i'm finished 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:58.500
 cover our model with epoxy glue 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.500
 now set it to dry 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:07.299
 here after it dries it 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:10.119
 hours ten need no more well if you 

00:07:07.299 --> 00:07:13.689
 bought epoxy glue d20 it will 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:15.789
 look around here and so it is already 

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:17.499
 that's harder but still see 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:20.110
 rigidity is not enough enough 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:24.659
 so we will do this procedure two 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:28.289
 three times Well I think that's all 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:32.849
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.849
 good luck to you bye bye
