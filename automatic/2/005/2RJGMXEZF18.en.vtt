00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 very good to everyone and for now and 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.720
 Welcome to new information 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.150
 Pokemon 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello guys today is the day of the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 innocent for the Anglo-Saxon world in the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
 prim full day on April 1 , 2014 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 in which there are a lot of jokes about 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.609
 all internet for everything practically for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
 everyone making jokes and jokes and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.900
 teasing jokes series besides and it seems 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 be that nintendo and google have 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.869
 merged to make a joke too 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 I would be seeing on screen 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.710
 It's probably an ad that's pretty 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.170
 Curiado by the way in an animation of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 people looking for pokémons and finding 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
 those with the mobile so equal now is that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.239
 As it has been less charging currado 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 the less and that are hours that cool 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 It's really cool but obviously this 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.000
 it's not true this is not it's not real but 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.079
 yes that is real in a certain way is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.629
 right now you put it in your 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.180
 smartphone with your tablet you put 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 in google maps in the two version 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.520
 dimensions the version in three 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.110
 dimensions I think it's not so 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.449
 except I tried it and it was not 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 I put it in two dimensions and yes that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.120
 I was this type of little more 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 as radio google has merged with 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 the pokémon company to make a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 kind of limited mini game that 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 consists of searching throughout the entire 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.520
 google world map 150 pokemons 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.870
 I do not know now it's pretty funny if you put 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 to myself on google maps and find 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.410
 lot of pokemon if you do not count any 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.390
 get into the santiago bernabéu stadium 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.710
 in the state of real madrid there yes that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.860
 sure there is one because it is the first 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.270
 that I found that is that they cléon and is that 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.740
 as long as I tell you of everything all the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 map of the world you will find a lot 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.090
 of pokemon just many are 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.010
 repeated to search and to stop 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.479
 find the 150 we can faster 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.880
 because if it would not be a utopia it would be 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.410
 impossible to find it 150 pokemons and still 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.180
 so it was quite difficult 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.729
 find a lot of priísmo in a 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.530
 bunch of rats the rats not sorry 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.869
 pichis and that jones 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.490
 but not me but they did not find 150 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.009
 clear pokemon that I do not know how many 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.390
 I do not know I'll have about 30 about 40 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.130
 about 50 is that quite complicated 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.440
 find not sincerely enough 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.420
 quite complicated but if you go by 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.550
 example the angels you know a tokio vais 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.380
 to winfrey itself sure 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.470
 you will find one or the other because we are going 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.899
 Fixed and say you have until 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.460
 April 2 to find the 350 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.990
 pokémons when we find all the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.850
 Pokemon did not make any prize or 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 something like that but of course in 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.660

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.850

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.470

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.880

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.070
