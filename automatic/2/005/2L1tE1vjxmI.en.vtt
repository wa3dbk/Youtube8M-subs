know what we should just recreate all of
the<00:00:49.260> missing<00:00:49.530> episodes<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> cast<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
we had in this production I think I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.299 
we had in this production I think I
would<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.379> great<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.800> incredibly

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
would be great to be incredibly

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.860 
would be great to be incredibly
expensive<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:54.059> these<00:00:54.239> guys<00:00:54.449> won't<00:00:54.600> come

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
expensive because these guys won't come

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
expensive because these guys won't come
cheap<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.399> incredibly<00:00:56.969> great

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
cheap but it would be incredibly great

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
cheap but it would be incredibly great
so<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.260> say<00:00:58.469> yeah<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so I would say yeah if you can do it and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.220 
so I would say yeah if you can do it and
they're<00:01:00.180> willing<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.570> work<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.780> next<00:01:01.170> to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
they're willing to work for next to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
they're willing to work for next to
nothing<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:01.949> much<00:01:02.129> you'll

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
nothing because that's how much you'll

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369 
nothing because that's how much you'll
have<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.579> pay<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.449> she'll<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
have to pay them then she'll go with it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.590 
have to pay them then she'll go with it
but<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.890> think<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> happen

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
news that the science community has

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.630 
news that the science community has
managed<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.150> compress<00:04:58.110> everything<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:59.400> is

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
managed to compress everything that is

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.780 
managed to compress everything that is
needed<00:05:00.300> about<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.690> man<00:05:00.960> into<00:05:01.830> two<00:05:02.400> chromosomes

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
needed about a man into two chromosomes

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.080 
needed about a man into two chromosomes
in<00:05:03.300> mice<00:05:03.540> and<00:05:04.190> still<00:05:05.190> nice<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.430> reproduce

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
in mice and still nice to reproduce

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.540 
in mice and still nice to reproduce
other<00:05:06.420> mice<00:05:06.810> from<00:05:07.560> these<00:05:07.830> mice<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.280> have<00:05:08.370> got

basically man zip in their gene code
it's<00:05:12.000> amazing<00:05:12.450> this<00:05:13.200> is<00:05:13.350> an<00:05:13.500> incredible<00:05:13.980> step

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it's amazing this is an incredible step

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.850 
it's amazing this is an incredible step
forward<00:05:14.520> not<00:05:14.670> just<00:05:14.700> because<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.720> allows<00:05:16.110> a<00:05:16.560> lot

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
forward not just because it allows a lot

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.110 
forward not just because it allows a lot
of<00:05:16.950> science<00:05:17.250> fiction<00:05:17.370> writers<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:17.970> write<00:05:18.030> a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
of science fiction writers to write a

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.330 
of science fiction writers to write a
whole<00:05:18.510> lot<00:05:18.780> more<00:05:18.990> books<00:05:19.590> about<00:05:19.830> what<00:05:20.100> if<00:05:20.220> we

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
whole lot more books about what if we

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.010 
whole lot more books about what if we
don't<00:05:20.490> need<00:05:20.730> men<00:05:20.940> anymore<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:21.720> is<00:05:21.810> that

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
don't need men anymore but is that

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.380 
don't need men anymore but is that
they're<00:05:22.320> always<00:05:22.500> interesting<00:05:23.340> what<00:05:23.520> ifs<00:05:23.730> but

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
they're always interesting what ifs but

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.080 
they're always interesting what ifs but
also<00:05:24.780> it<00:05:25.080> means<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.500> men<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.430> don't<00:05:26.670> have<00:05:27.060> a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
also it means that men that don't have a

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.990 
also it means that men that don't have a

going to be good thinkers stability is

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.780 
going to be good thinkers stability is
horrible<00:05:34.470> as<00:05:34.680> someone<00:05:35.280> who<00:05:35.430> can't<00:05:35.640> have

children themselves I'd love to be able
to<00:05:37.410> have<00:05:37.470> children<00:05:37.530> so<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.250> know<00:05:38.370> what<00:05:38.970> these

to have children so I know what these
people<00:05:39.780> are<00:05:39.930> going<00:05:40.080> through<00:05:40.230> when<00:05:40.800> they<00:05:40.920> find

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
people are going through when they find

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.320 
people are going through when they find
that<00:05:41.220> they<00:05:41.490> want<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:41.790> have<00:05:41.880> kids<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.210> they've

tried to have kids in the can't so this

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.130 
tried to have kids in the can't so this

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
is great this is a fantastic step

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.900 
is great this is a fantastic step
forward<00:05:46.410> it's<00:05:46.530> not<00:05:46.710> going<00:05:46.890> to<00:05:46.950> mean<00:05:47.160> any<00:05:47.610> new

there isn't an equivalent between the

there isn't an equivalent between the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
species we've got to work enough on our

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.270 
species we've got to work enough on our
own<00:06:00.390> in<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:01.110> new<00:06:01.320> environment<00:06:01.440> as<00:06:01.890> well<00:06:01.950> so

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
own in this new environment as well so

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.670 
own in this new environment as well so
you<00:06:02.760> take<00:06:02.940> that<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.390> go<00:06:03.570> right<00:06:03.930> what<00:06:04.470> can

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
you take that and you go right what can

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.050 
you take that and you go right what can
we<00:06:04.770> learn<00:06:04.920> from<00:06:04.980> that<00:06:05.160> and<00:06:05.430> apply<00:06:05.730> to<00:06:05.760> this

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
we learn from that and apply to this

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.450 
we learn from that and apply to this
because<00:06:06.660> this<00:06:06.960> one<00:06:07.170> is<00:06:07.350> very<00:06:07.770> different<00:06:08.250> but

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
because this one is very different but

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.560 
because this one is very different but
they're<00:06:08.580> going<00:06:08.730> to<00:06:08.790> get<00:06:08.880> there<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:09.270> can<00:06:09.450> tell

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
they're going to get there I can tell

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.880 
they're going to get there I can tell
you<00:06:09.690> that<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.110> hope<00:06:10.230> that<00:06:10.410> it<00:06:10.560> works<00:06:10.650> out

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
you that and I hope that it works out

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.280 
you that and I hope that it works out
well<00:06:11.130> because<00:06:11.610> that's<00:06:12.030> great<00:06:12.360> it<00:06:12.750> also<00:06:12.870> means

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
well because that's great it also means

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.350 
well because that's great it also means
that<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:14.070> could<00:06:14.310> be<00:06:14.340> potentially<00:06:15.120> some

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
that it could be potentially some

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.390 
that it could be potentially some

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
fertility treatments for lesbian couples

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.310 
fertility treatments for lesbian couples
who<00:06:17.520> want<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.210> have<00:06:18.270> children<00:06:18.390> between<00:06:18.990> each

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
who want to have children between each

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.830 
who want to have children between each
other<00:06:19.530> as<00:06:19.710> well<00:06:19.890> because<00:06:20.460> if<00:06:20.640> you<00:06:21.390> can<00:06:21.540> get<00:06:21.690> all

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
other as well because if you can get all

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.960 
other as well because if you can get all
the<00:06:21.870> information<00:06:22.140> you<00:06:22.500> need<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.970> replicate

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
the information you need and replicate

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.730 
the information you need and replicate
it<00:06:24.120> from<00:06:24.570> other<00:06:24.840> information<00:06:25.410> that's<00:06:25.530> within

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
it from other information that's within

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.670 
it from other information that's within
the<00:06:26.010> gene<00:06:26.250> cord<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.730> the<00:06:27.320> one<00:06:28.320> of<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.530> mothers

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
the gene cord of the one of the mothers

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.640 
the gene cord of the one of the mothers
then<00:06:29.220> you<00:06:29.730> can<00:06:29.910> make<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.150> new<00:06:30.420> Y<00:06:30.960> chromosome<00:06:31.500> and

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
then you can make a new Y chromosome and

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.670 
then you can make a new Y chromosome and
new<00:06:31.860> sperm<00:06:32.160> cells<00:06:32.490> by<00:06:33.090> creating<00:06:33.810> that<00:06:33.990> now<00:06:34.470> be

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
new sperm cells by creating that now be

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.010 
new sperm cells by creating that now be
very<00:06:34.860> interesting<00:06:35.520> again<00:06:35.940> long<00:06:36.630> way<00:06:36.840> off

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
very interesting again long way off

we're talking decades at

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.779 
we're talking decades at
least<00:06:38.669> but<00:06:39.509> it's<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.530> good<00:06:40.650> one<00:06:40.889> to<00:06:41.099> try<00:06:41.430> and

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
least but it's a good one to try and

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.640 
least but it's a good one to try and
work<00:06:41.910> on<00:06:42.090> because<00:06:42.419> that's<00:06:43.169> going<00:06:43.319> to<00:06:43.410> help<00:06:43.530> a
