 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.250
 one of Latin America in this video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.390
 we will talk about the antibodies and the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.220
 immune response 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.410
 in the body there is what 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.010
 called the immune response whose 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.290
 function is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.860
 fight the strange agents that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.380
 can enter the system organism 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.750
 immune is made up of different 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.000
 cells among which we find the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.380
 lymphocytes b 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 these lymphocytes are going to recognize the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.830
 strange people who are also called 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.330
 antigen and produce molecules called 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:50.379
 antibodies that are going to join in shape 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.830
 specific to each antigen what is going to 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.590
 shoot a cascade of mechanisms that 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.559
 They will lead to the elimination 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.050
 antibodies also called 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.619
 immunoglobulins are glycoproteins that 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 can act by joining directly to 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.560
 antigen being present in the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.550
 lymphocyte membrane be o with 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.369
 circulating molecules let's see now the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.009
 structure of an antibody a 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.160
 antibody will be formed by two 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.180
 types of poly peptide chains that are 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.930
 the heavy chains called h and the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.480
 light chains called l 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.380
 both are united with each other through 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.240
 covalent bonds these chains are going to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.240
 have a variable region 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.679
 and a constant region for the case of 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.969
 light chains or three regions 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.909
 constants for the case of the chains 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.460
 heavy 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.670
 the variable regions are going to be the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 involved in the recognition of 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.789
 antigen at functional level can be 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.539
 highlight two fragments of an antibody 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:14.310
 as the Fab fragment binding fragment 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.610
 to the antigen and the effector fragment that is 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.920
 the fragment that is related 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.250
 directly with the proper function of the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.880
 antibody for antigens 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.810
 an antigen is going to be formed by 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.270
 different antigenic determinants or 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.270
 also called epitopes 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 the epitopes are going to be the regions of 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.780
 antigen that are going to be recognized by 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.020
 an antibody every time and mole is going to be 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.510
 recognized by a particular antibody 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.160
 to the set of antibodies that go to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.730
 participate in the recognition of a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.440
 antigen are called antibodies 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.440
 clonal poly 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.540
 that is to say it is the set of antibodies 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.450
 that are going to join this filter to step and 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.230
 topo and to this title each type of 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.270
 antibody is going to be produced by a 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.270
 lymphocyte of particular 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.080
 Now, if we talk about the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.440
 antibodies generated by a single 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.220
 lymphocyte that they will recognize in a 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.930
 specific to a single epitopes we are 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.130
 before what is a set of 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.130
 monoclonal antibodies 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.209
 in the next videos we will do a little 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.330
 of history about antibodies on 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.310
 its use in science and we'll see in 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.880
 detail how the antibodies 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.480
 monoclonal thanks to the development of 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.770
 the molecular biology techniques 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.730
 They proved to be a valuable tool 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.730
 therapy 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.810
 to see the continuation of this topic 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.620
 educationally I recommend that you see the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.620
 next video
