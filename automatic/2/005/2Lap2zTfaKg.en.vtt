00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.519
 now good to all if you comment good 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.070
 and we are going to make a strategy for 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.259
 new penis or gray mode then before 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 start the real game I'm going to 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.980
 come here because I'm going to explain little to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
 little and slowly how are we going to do it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 everything then first of all nothing 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 more start the game that is the most 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.390
 important all our colleagues go 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.699
 to come here and they will take the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.220
 shotgun all our teammates worth 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.940
 the other partner will be looking 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.030
 window for the room to do the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.739
 points killing zombies and that the fourth 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.989
 partner of the one who is going to open the doors 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 is worth nothing more than there is one that is going to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.559
 keep the money without touching it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 that now then I'll say why then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 we are going to come this door nothing more than 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.979
 one of the four that is going to join the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.799
 money no more that you have the money 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.839
 let's get this door 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.519
 very important for this door we accede 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.830
 before down the stairs and we arrived before 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.869
 above that it is our end our end 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.970
 is to arrive before the others above 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.260
 Well, with that said let's start and 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.240
 Now I'm going to tell you what we would do 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240
 up we will start the game 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.660
 we started then the strategy now 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 let's do what we were saying 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.890
 we go first for the two shotguns 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.470
 we are going to come some compañeros and they are going to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.710
 catch both the two shotguns then 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 Now we are going to be calling 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.770
 partner that has to go killing the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.660
 zombies if we see zombie in the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.550
 windows and he does not see them he can warn you 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.100
 come well here is going to kill the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.350
 then you have to get 750 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 points, nothing more than what the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.050
 750 points quickly we will go to 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 the girl door of the farm of the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.100
 door girl upstairs and let's go inside 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.960
 the first before anyone then 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.660
 now he just called us let's go 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 running for here we are running to 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.590
 that we get here and enter the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.090
 first before anyone else the trick is the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.770
 here the main example of the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.570
 strategy is to go up before the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.610
 others then nothing else we're here 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 the two companions of the shotgun are 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
 they knock down and then here we have done 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.640
 a piece of wall that does not enter here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.820
 means here one among my colleagues state 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 then as we would say the mp5 is worth 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.420
 we would take the bbc 5 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 we will watch this window and live 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.050
 we would do this part here both the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 another partner like me 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.830
 when we already have points we are not going to 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.370
 throw the box we will not throw the house 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.900
 then we will save to take it mp5 and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.520
 later to be able to catch us the titan 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 it's also worth that that is also 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.170
 important then once that before 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 catch not the titan when he has already fly 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 I will change with my colleagues and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.110
 then we will change places but 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.670
 one by one to not leave gaps for 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.740
 that the other trios can pass for 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
 come on, we can go ahead and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.630
 now you are going to see little by little how 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.630
 we are doing 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.800
 having the mp5 and once they have gone 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.150
 the opposing team's opponents 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.580
 we quickly changed but always 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.590
 of 11 is worth not to leave space for 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.900
 they can get them always 11 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.520
 then we could continue calm 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.819
 without problems that we get 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.819
 no one 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.970
 well now when I started moving the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.040
 fruits of the strategy now they 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.480
 they try to come up here because they have 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.130
 money to throw the box but as not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.990
 they can do nothing because we are and are 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.720
 putting in the entrance they are dying 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.160
 so now the zombies are coming and 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.440
 like nothing else they have clean sides 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.060
 keros well the pistolita of shit then 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.100
 then they can not do anything if we are 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.960
 the round 4 imagine a little later 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.610
 is a radio pechá go inflatable 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.080
 ridiculous your colleagues good 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.000
 so now here they are lucky 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 that it's the skull's turn and then 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.260
 that is saved if the four were not 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.390
 killed instantly if we had a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.430
 meat chub of zombies perfect what 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.980
 we would pull and down to adjust it from 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 refrigerator , we would stop it all 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.600
 and they would die in the safe act just 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.310
 afterwards then people then nothing but 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.710
 would be watch the back windows 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.319
 always and try to have good weapons and 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.030
 palante we will continue at the end 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.459
 normally we have already finished with the one 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.200
 we had won the game and before 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.420
 to say goodbye and you know the most 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.920
 important is the principle that arrives 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.719
 up first is the king of the mambo 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.480
