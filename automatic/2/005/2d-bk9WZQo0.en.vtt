are the kind of teachers that we have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770 
are the kind of teachers that we have
here<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:52.979> beyond<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> our

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
here but beyond that a lot of our

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.389 
here but beyond that a lot of our
teaching<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.229> based<00:01:55.439> upon<00:01:55.619> creating

teaching is based upon creating

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.060 
teaching is based upon creating
community<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.770> teacher

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
community so it's not just one teacher

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.039 
community so it's not just one teacher
only<00:01:59.790> teaching<00:02:00.149> one<00:02:00.360> thing<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.869> really

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
only teaching one thing it's really

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.170 
only teaching one thing it's really
teaching<00:02:01.469> people<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.670> teachers<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
teaching people to be teachers is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.789 
teaching people to be teachers is
keeping<00:02:03.509> teaching<00:02:03.810> people<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> leaders<00:02:04.590> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
keeping teaching people to be leaders I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
keeping teaching people to be leaders I
would<00:02:05.579> say<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> biggest<00:02:06.060> teacher<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.719> have

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
would say the biggest teacher we have

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.600 
would say the biggest teacher we have
here<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> student<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.250> students

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
here really is a student but students

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
here really is a student but students
teach<00:02:08.759> themselves
