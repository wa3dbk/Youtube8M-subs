00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
contract is basically the same as last

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.599 
contract is basically the same as last
time<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.330> few<00:00:28.779> big<00:00:29.019> pink<00:00:29.289> new<00:00:29.500> matches<00:00:29.949> and<00:00:30.130> then

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
time a few big pink new matches and then

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.190 
time a few big pink new matches and then
obviously<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:31.029> build<00:00:31.269> up<00:00:31.449> on<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:32.020> rules

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
obviously the build up on the rules

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.680 
obviously the build up on the rules
prior<00:00:32.619> so<00:00:33.489> pretty<00:00:33.910> much<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.180> same<00:00:34.329> for<00:00:34.480> Brock

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
prior so pretty much the same for Brock

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.770 
prior so pretty much the same for Brock
not<00:00:35.260> too<00:00:35.410> many<00:00:35.590> dates<00:00:35.800> involved<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:37.540> goes<00:00:37.750> on

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
not too many dates involved it goes on

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.060 
not too many dates involved it goes on
to<00:00:38.020> say<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.260> Brock<00:00:38.710> doesn't<00:00:38.829> actually

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
to say that Brock doesn't actually

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.529 
to say that Brock doesn't actually
signed<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.610> contract<00:00:40.059> yet<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.510> probably

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
signed the contract yet and probably

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.750 
signed the contract yet and probably
were<00:00:41.260> in<00:00:41.410> their<00:00:41.649> future<00:00:41.860> until<00:00:42.460> nearer

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
were in their future until nearer

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.479 
were in their future until nearer
WrestleMania<00:00:43.980> according<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> article

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
WrestleMania according to the article

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.250 
WrestleMania according to the article
that's<00:00:45.670> apparently<00:00:46.120> how<00:00:46.329> Lesnar<00:00:46.690> has<00:00:46.870> always

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
that's apparently how Lesnar has always

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.080 
that's apparently how Lesnar has always
done<00:00:47.410> business<00:00:47.620> probably<00:00:48.370> leaving<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:48.969> to<00:00:49.030> the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
done business probably leaving it to the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090 
done business probably leaving it to the
last<00:00:49.149> minute<00:00:49.390> so<00:00:49.809> we<00:00:50.199> can<00:00:50.289> get<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.590> best<00:00:50.800> deal

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
last minute so we can get the best deal

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.360 
last minute so we can get the best deal
for<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.430> WWE<00:00:51.910> as<00:00:51.969> possible<00:00:53.160> also<00:00:54.160> on<00:00:54.280> the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.060 
article does mention the Undertaker fans
like<00:00:57.370> myself<00:00:57.899> I've<00:00:58.899> been<00:00:59.140> thinking<00:00:59.379> maybe<00:00:59.859> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
like myself I've been thinking maybe the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.549 
like myself I've been thinking maybe the
end<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.250> taker<00:01:00.489> could<00:01:00.850> face<00:01:01.059> Brock<00:01:01.269> Lesnar

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
end the taker could face Brock Lesnar

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.630 
end the taker could face Brock Lesnar
but<00:01:02.559> we<00:01:02.710> would<00:01:02.829> go<00:01:02.949> back<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.309> couple<00:01:03.430> of

the<00:01:47.700> n-taker<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> shame<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> matches

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.080 
the n-taker it's a shame that matches
highly<00:01:49.740> unlikely<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.220> happening<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.820> but

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
highly unlikely to be happening now but

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
highly unlikely to be happening now but
still<00:01:51.960> these<00:01:52.290> two<00:01:52.619> big<00:01:52.890> guy<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> many<00:01:53.340> times

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
still these two big guy that many times

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
still these two big guy that many times
in<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> past<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.899> we've<00:01:55.049> never

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
in the past so it's not like we've never

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
in the past so it's not like we've never
saw<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> food<00:01:55.770> before<00:01:55.860> anyway<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.729> mean<00:01:57.570> if

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
saw the food before anyway I mean if

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.240 
saw the food before anyway I mean if
Brock<00:01:57.869> doesn't<00:01:58.080> resize<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.590> first<00:01:58.890> ever<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
Brock doesn't resize my first ever as I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
Brock doesn't resize my first ever as I
think<00:01:59.460> he<00:01:59.580> will<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.479> there's<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
think he will then there's going to be a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.510 
think he will then there's going to be a
lot<00:02:01.619> more<00:02:01.649> opponents<00:02:02.220> with<00:02:02.340> Brock<00:02:02.490> Lesnar

face<00:02:03.030> anyway<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> fact<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.890> he's<00:02:05.070> not

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
face anyway so the fact that he's not
