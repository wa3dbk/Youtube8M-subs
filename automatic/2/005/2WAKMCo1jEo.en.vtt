what happens so let's turn right down
here<00:04:06.579> I<00:04:06.790> installed<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:09.120> I'm<00:04:10.120> just<00:04:10.329> basically

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
here I installed the I'm just basically

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.610 
here I installed the I'm just basically
plug<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.560> then<00:04:12.549> tape<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.150> up<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.620> it's

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
plug it in and then tape it up and it's

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.009 
plug it in and then tape it up and it's
ready<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.920> go<00:04:15.069> they<00:04:15.579> took<00:04:15.700> me<00:04:15.879> like<00:04:16.000> 10<00:04:16.720> minutes

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
ready to go they took me like 10 minutes

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.430 
ready to go they took me like 10 minutes
and<00:04:17.350> most<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.370> time<00:04:18.609> was<00:04:19.079> trying<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.229> tie

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
and most that time was trying to tie

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.930 
and most that time was trying to tie
that<00:04:20.680> thing<00:04:20.919> onto<00:04:21.519> there<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:24.280> not<00:04:24.460> super

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
that thing onto there it's not super

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.659 
that thing onto there it's not super
there's<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.690> other<00:04:26.350> thing<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.590> left<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.190> do<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.400> to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
there's a other thing I left to do is to

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.909 
there's a other thing I left to do is to
set<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.000> sensor<00:04:28.360> somewhere<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.650> little

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
set the sensor somewhere so little

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.730 
set the sensor somewhere so little
always<00:04:30.490> get<00:04:30.639> a<00:04:30.669> signal<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.270> other<00:04:31.419> than<00:04:31.479> that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
always get a signal but other than that

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:41.400 
always get a signal but other than that
it's<00:04:32.740> good<00:04:32.949> to<00:04:33.099> go<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.889> there<00:04:39.130> we<00:04:39.220> are<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:40.410> it

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
it's good to go so there we are and it

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.939 
it's good to go so there we are and it
seems<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> working<00:04:42.009> out<00:04:42.310> pretty<00:04:42.460> well<00:04:42.580> so

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:57.210 

and<00:04:47.949> then<00:04:54.870> sides<00:04:55.870> that's<00:04:56.620> where<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.889> have<00:04:57.099> it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
and then sides that's where I have it

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.529 
and then sides that's where I have it
and<00:04:57.370> then<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.669> just<00:04:57.820> did<00:04:57.970> that<00:04:58.090> quick<00:04:58.330> loop

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
and then I just did that quick loop

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.439 
and then I just did that quick loop
thing<00:04:58.750> but<00:04:59.740> you<00:05:00.099> use<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:00.849> try<00:05:00.970> to<00:05:01.030> bend<00:05:01.270> the

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
thing but you use and try to bend the

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.899 
thing but you use and try to bend the
flex<00:05:02.229> line<00:05:03.720> unless<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.990> can<00:05:05.110> just<00:05:05.260> take<00:05:05.409> it<00:05:05.440> down

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
flex line unless I can just take it down

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.790 
flex line unless I can just take it down
