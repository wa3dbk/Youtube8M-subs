00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.670
 and then staff solemn youtube to br 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.080
 stock with a gped 7.0 g by 1400 and 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 They will answer there. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 basically three questions that the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 personal made me the personal boxing video 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 So the first question is why do I 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 I bought this and there was no 508 point 3 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.060
 inch he has a processor 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 better has more memory has even more 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 8.3 in relations than 7.0 and the difference is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.940
 very small the difference is very small 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 because it is because the following fact the today 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.250
 asks and 8.3 I did not buy because it is already a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 tablet from last year 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 no, because I can not not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.199
 I consider it outdated but I think 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.570
 rather that his team has passed is understood 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 and now for example this one is a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.059
 lg tablet launch 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.840
 together with him he has already thrown him the lg 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.450
 launched the 17 again an 18-inch 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.729
 or not 8.3 we will not confuse and one 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.130
 10 inches and I found this one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.070
 very interesting his settings 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 although 8.3 is better, I agree 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.090
 with even better camera of 5 megapixels 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 with plot of 2003 point 15 ok, I do not 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 I remember if it's 8.3 it has expansion to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.619
 the memory 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 but it also comes with the feature of not 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.710
 It 's really cool, here it is. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 he already trains in the pattern now for the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.240
 your devices when you speak 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.860
 device as much as it is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 tablet 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.880
 it is then that this was the reason for being a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.600
 because he is new 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 also the most current android for LG 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.119
 okay I will not say that Google launched it 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.439
 google is on the 4 4 2 that is on the 4 4 2 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.630
 so I found it cool because of these details 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.110
 staff because otherwise I would have 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.970
 bought 8.3 but did not buy because 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.130
 because I had already bought the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.070
 samsung 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.320
 this team is only at the time was between the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.910
 that the one that samsung ends up 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.810
 buying the one I see that is 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.730
 much better than lg's and I like it 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.510
 Too bad, it's a fast tablet without 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.560
 gagging 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.870
 okay and then spent his time came this 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.880
 here I will buy and if I will not buy the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.190
 rg as I said he already had his time 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.320
 was released last year in 2013 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.000
 and this one is the launch of the series that 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.850
 He released a month ago and I think that already 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.560
 launched and now arrives in the physical stores 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 purchase in a physical store 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.870
 I found it very cool the second 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.020
 question why Ig and not samsung 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.300
 our talk so our breaking it 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:05.790
 break a few days to break the backrest 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:09.220
 joão vitor break the backrest, oh my god 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.080
 not bought a team almost everyone 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.230
 is betting on the top4 everyone is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.590
 betting on an iphone or the glass was 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.150
 posting a g3 g3 is a cell phone is very 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.980
 had not bought these 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.350
 five would have bought og 3 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 okay if he had g3 perhaps would 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:32.680
 bought z2 da sony xperia and more 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:36.340
 because the people I already know as that 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.350
 is the interface of samsung I already know as 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.260
 is the way the samsung tablet 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:48.970
 the finishing I know many details 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.050
 because I do not know this reasonably well 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.230
 the details of samsung where i am very 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.680
 I already used this contact I already experienced 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.600
 also the motorola interface is a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.300
 almost pure android interface almost 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.790
 pure okay that is a simple interface 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.470
 Damn fast and fluent here. 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.840
 It's also proving this for now. 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:17.400
 I'm moving lg to break up a little 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.139
 this hegemony there to power 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.680
 did you know that there are other 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.320
 technologies as good as samsung's 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.080
 so much better than that of samsung 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.789
 also has the sony interface that I 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.740
 I think it's also cool that she adopts 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.880
 procel your devices your 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.639
 especially the phones I think a lot 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.539
 Nice, I really liked this interface already. 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.190
 I liked it since 8.3 of fgts 8.3 only 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.900
 I did not buy because of 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.500
 memory processor is the processor and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.080
 camera and processor and there find very 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.449
 samsung nice but also a ips 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.389
 Amazing screen like I already told you 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.320
 was for that reason so I bought the 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.990
 rg 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.389
 did not fulfill 83 with bought 7 did not 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.580
 I bought a Samsung I bought a LG 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.160
 when how much did I pay how much did it cost? 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.310
 staff focus on website 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.229
 on the site of the house bahia 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.080
 the Bahia homes you can see there when 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.810
 got that was here was how much 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.090
 I paid, you did not have the discount because 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.860
 is precisely because it is an ultra mega super 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.729
 blaster top elfman and then what is and 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.500
 launch 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.159
 usually they do not give discount to 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.349
 electronic no in any aki store 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.650
 I do not know if it 's a card to 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:44.159
 mockup is if I can do it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.110
 many and crying 5% off and look 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.190
 there they have to cry a lot 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.370
 folks 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:54.240
 so this is it are three basic questions 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.909
 So I decided to make this video for 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.460
 Talk to you, it's okay. I 'm enjoying it. 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.530
 people to tinker with the few hours that the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.360
 that I needed combustion 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.289
 I found this really cool feature not 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.880
 Call od here O is understood that this 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.419
 transition here 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.349
 it does that it will make it fade 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:20.190
 I do not know if this made of fade right 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:21.870
 Snow cool as hell they do not have any 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.090
 from samsung from samsung I have one 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.229
 that the blind effect 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.910
 water you very much do not like it is 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.400
 made water 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.150
 is the perceived effect is cool but this 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.550
 here is very cool this effect that is that 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.770
 lg use this here close the screen too 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.380
 It's very cool too. 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.120
 I do not have either samsung or samsung 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.410
 have to put a third party program 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.510
 To do that, right? 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.430
 you put a custom brown for 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.310
 it has this effect 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.190
 samsung is very much plastered by 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.920
 some things to her she lived is okay 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.170
 making the ideas a bit better 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.090
 of others there is putting your tablet 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.440
 leaving a little more versatile but not 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.680
 She likes to leave that thing like that. 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.140
 not our standard is this one. 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.050
 that's the way we like it too 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.120
 it can not be so because if she 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.980
 keep going like this , I like 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.500
 samsung i have several devices 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.720
 samsung I've had several others I like 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.320
 but if it continues it will stay 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.070
 back in the market because it has sony LG and 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.470
 motorola has shawn chapman the man is not 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.830
 I think he's a man who has even gone through 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.560
 samsung na in china lg is doing 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.620
 The biggest success in China is then the 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.410
 samsung to take care because if she does not 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.780
 I can take good advantage of it there, oh, yes. 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.930
 if she does not know how to captivate her 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.630
 clients will lose market share or 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.990
 she said the samsung galaxy alpha will not 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.300
 save it in this quarter or not 4 too 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.800
 will not save the house at the loss and 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.169
 I hope it changes the concept a bit 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.430
 which looks at the LG changing the concept and 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:05.040
 I found it very cool 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:07.820
 congratulations to LG's congratulations same 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.310
 That's it await the next videos here 

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.590
 dodô lg pad personal touch so that's it 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:18.830
 If you liked the jewel of your message 

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.830
 Thank you so much and said people
