00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.520 
some mythril gloves and I haven't found
a<00:01:54.180> recipe<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> yet<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:54.990> I'll<00:01:55.110> upload<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
a recipe that yet but I'll upload it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.630 
a recipe that yet but I'll upload it
when<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:58.049> there's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> thing<00:01:59.009> over<00:01:59.159> here

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
when I do then there's a thing over here

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
when I do then there's a thing over here
that<00:02:00.060> looks<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.049> climb<00:02:01.469> aboard<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that looks like it's climb aboard but I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
that looks like it's climb aboard but I
could<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.759> life<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.360> me<00:02:03.479> work<00:02:03.630> out

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
could not for the life of me work out

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.910 
could not for the life of me work out
how<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:04.680> doesn't<00:02:04.860> appear

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
how to get up there there doesn't appear

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
how to get up there there doesn't appear
to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> grip<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.240> guessing<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.869> involves

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to be a grip so I'm guessing it involves

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.419 
to be a grip so I'm guessing it involves
doing<00:02:07.530> something<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.069> haven't<00:02:08.250> worked

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
doing something that I haven't worked

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300 
doing something that I haven't worked
out<00:02:08.610> yet<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.119> anyway<00:02:09.360> head<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
out yet so anyway head back and on the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.369 
out yet so anyway head back and on the
way<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.819> there<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> thing<00:02:12.930> begin

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
way back up here there is a thing begin

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.710 
way back up here there is a thing begin
Letus

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
Letus

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.330 
Letus
just<00:02:15.170> here<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> left<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.980> what<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.160> do<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
just here on the left and what you do is

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.490 
just here on the left and what you do is
jump<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:16.850> hit<00:02:16.970> attack<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.720> he'll<00:02:18.020> smash

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
jump and then hit attack and he'll smash

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.960 
jump and then hit attack and he'll smash
that<00:02:18.800> boom<00:02:19.070> smash<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.580> these<00:02:19.670> lifts<00:02:19.880> up<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that boom smash and these lifts up and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.340 
that boom smash and these lifts up and
from<00:02:23.210> there<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.570> want<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.780> switch<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.230> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
from there you want to switch to the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.870 
from there you want to switch to the
Legolas<00:02:24.740> because<00:02:25.130> there's<00:02:25.310> another<00:02:25.490> target

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
Legolas because there's another target

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.350 
Legolas because there's another target
there<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.990> get<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:27.860> shoot<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.640> target

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
there so get up there shoot the target

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.340 
there so get up there shoot the target
like<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.300> then<00:02:32.300> run<00:02:32.540> across<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.080> bridge

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
like that and then run across the bridge

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.320 
like that and then run across the bridge
that<00:02:33.590> opens<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.160> again<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.610> guess<00:02:34.910> pearl

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
that opens but again I guess pearl

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
that opens but again I guess pearl
legged<00:02:35.660> perspective<00:02:36.170> messes<00:02:36.470> with<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:36.710> head

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
legged perspective messes with my head

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.380 
legged perspective messes with my head
so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> moved<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.520> camera<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> bit<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.330> a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
so I moved a camera a bit and there's a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.980 
so I moved a camera a bit and there's a
silver<00:02:38.570> brick<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.050> yeah<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:41.660> one's<00:02:41.810> pretty

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
silver brick up yeah that one's pretty

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.710 
silver brick up yeah that one's pretty
straightforward<00:02:42.230> then<00:02:43.040> from<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:43.720> head

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
straightforward then from there head

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.670 
straightforward then from there head
back<00:02:45.050> down<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.820> Gandalf<00:02:47.450> statue<00:02:48.140> which<00:02:48.530> is

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
back down to the Gandalf statue which is

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.670 
back down to the Gandalf statue which is
right<00:02:48.920> by<00:02:49.220> where<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.550> started<00:02:50.030> off<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
right by where you started off and you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.290 
right by where you started off and you
can<00:02:51.830> use<00:02:51.860> Gandalf<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.550> move<00:02:52.790> these<00:02:53.000> bricks

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
can use Gandalf to move these bricks

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.580 
can use Gandalf to move these bricks
just<00:02:53.390> by<00:02:53.630> holding<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.230> what<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.410> want<00:02:54.560> to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
just by holding be and what you want to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.140 
just by holding be and what you want to
do<00:02:54.740> is<00:02:55.010> build<00:02:55.250> them<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.460> in<00:02:55.610> like<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> diagonal

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
do is build them up in like a diagonal

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.640 
do is build them up in like a diagonal
line<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.900> can't<00:02:57.110> get<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.380> from<00:02:57.410> there

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
line you can't get there from there

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.750 
line you can't get there from there
although<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.890> guess<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.190> could<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.460> jump<00:02:58.610> up

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
although I guess you could just jump up

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.470 
although I guess you could just jump up
there<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.740> Legolas<00:03:01.090> or<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.300> put<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
there as Legolas or you can put the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.700 
there as Legolas or you can put the
bricks<00:03:02.630> like<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.170> then<00:03:03.350> jump<00:03:03.530> up<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
bricks like that and then jump up the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.150 
bricks like that and then jump up the
side<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.820> there's<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> quest<00:03:05.360> up<00:03:05.630> at<00:03:05.810> here<00:03:06.170> too

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
side and there's a quest up at here too

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.090 
side and there's a quest up at here too
if<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.330> get<00:03:08.450> exactly<00:03:08.600> what<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.470> I'll

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
if we get exactly what it is but I'll

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.980 
if we get exactly what it is but I'll
replay<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.180> when<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.420> actually<00:03:11.600> find<00:03:11.900> the

replay it when I actually find the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.750 
replay it when I actually find the
mission<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.560> then<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.250> get<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.520> recipe

is<00:03:38.439> pointing<00:03:38.769> originally<00:03:39.189> you'll<00:03:39.310> find<00:03:39.549> a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
is pointing originally you'll find a

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.190 
is pointing originally you'll find a
waterfall<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.629> can<00:03:40.749> actually<00:03:40.840> pass

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
waterfall and you can actually pass

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.440 
waterfall and you can actually pass
through<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.620> waterfall<00:03:42.129> like<00:03:42.249> this<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.760> in

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
through this waterfall like this and in

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.089 
through this waterfall like this and in
here<00:03:43.989> there's<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> bunch<00:03:44.469> of<00:03:44.530> stuff<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.829> see<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
here there's a bunch of stuff I see the

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.530 
here there's a bunch of stuff I see the
golem<00:03:45.430> has<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.730> use<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:45.969> all<00:03:46.090> come<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.480> in

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
golem has to use it all come to that in

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.030 
golem has to use it all come to that in
a<00:03:46.599> second<00:03:46.930> Gimli<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.319> smash<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:47.980> I'm

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
a second Gimli can smash that and I'm

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.449 
a second Gimli can smash that and I'm
not<00:03:48.189> sure<00:03:48.340> what<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.670> did<00:03:48.939> but<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:50.099> think<00:03:51.099> maybe

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
not sure what that did but I think maybe

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.280 
not sure what that did but I think maybe
these<00:03:51.670> things<00:03:51.879> popped<00:03:52.239> out<00:03:52.450> which<00:03:52.840> Legolas

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
these things popped out which Legolas

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.500 
these things popped out which Legolas
can<00:03:53.500> fire<00:03:53.680> arrows<00:03:54.040> at<00:03:54.219> just<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.609> before<00:03:54.849> and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
can fire arrows at just like before and

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.530 
can fire arrows at just like before and
he<00:03:56.019> can<00:03:56.200> use<00:03:56.439> them<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.859> jump<00:03:57.340> up<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.670> swim<00:03:58.420> off

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
he can use them to jump up and swim off

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.479 
he can use them to jump up and swim off
so<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.500> can<00:03:59.590> swing<00:03:59.829> up<00:03:59.919> there<00:04:00.129> and<00:04:00.250> up<00:04:00.310> there

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
so you can swing up there and up there

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.399 
so you can swing up there and up there
and<00:04:00.609> up<00:04:00.669> there<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.209> grab<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> coin<00:04:01.780> although

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
and up there and grab a coin although

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.690 
and up there and grab a coin although
there<00:04:02.560> doesn't<00:04:02.590> seem<00:04:02.859> much<00:04:03.040> else<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.459> do<00:04:03.669> in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
there doesn't seem much else to do in

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.489 
there doesn't seem much else to do in
here<00:04:03.909> right<00:04:04.120> now<00:04:04.269> I'll<00:04:04.510> walk<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.260> show<00:04:05.439> you

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:05.499 
here right now I'll walk up to show you

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.959 
here right now I'll walk up to show you
where<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:05.829> think<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.189> golden<00:04:06.489> bits<00:04:06.609> are<00:04:06.790> used

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:06.969 
where I think the golden bits are used

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.089 
where I think the golden bits are used
because<00:04:07.930> there's<00:04:08.200> fish<00:04:08.409> bones<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.950> I

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
because there's fish bones and I

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.890 
because there's fish bones and I
remember<00:04:09.549> from<00:04:09.969> the<00:04:10.090> book<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.540> film<00:04:10.750> he

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
remember from the book in the film he

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.459 
remember from the book in the film he
likes<00:04:11.079> eating<00:04:11.409> raw<00:04:12.129> fish<00:04:12.340> dead<00:04:12.579> fish<00:04:13.439> so<00:04:14.439> I

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
likes eating raw fish dead fish so I

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.560 
likes eating raw fish dead fish so I
think<00:04:14.590> we're<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.549> need<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.849> unlock<00:04:16.120> Colin

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
think we're gonna need to unlock Colin

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.120 
think we're gonna need to unlock Colin
before<00:04:16.840> we<00:04:16.900> can<00:04:17.019> get<00:04:17.169> up<00:04:17.259> there<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:17.680> there<00:04:18.039> was

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
before we can get up there and there was

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.310 
before we can get up there and there was
another<00:04:18.370> little<00:04:19.000> fish<00:04:19.359> thing<00:04:19.660> like<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:20.019> back

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
another little fish thing like that back

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.680 
another little fish thing like that back
in<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.070> first<00:04:21.669> ringwraith<00:04:22.090> mission<00:04:22.449> when<00:04:22.599> we

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
in the first ringwraith mission when we

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.480 
in the first ringwraith mission when we
left<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> Shire<00:04:23.199> so<00:04:23.650> any<00:04:23.919> treats<00:04:24.190> see<00:04:24.370> what

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
left the Shire so any treats see what

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.070 
left the Shire so any treats see what
that<00:04:24.580> Dustin<00:04:24.910> anyway<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.599> hope<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.960> was

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
that Dustin anyway I hope that was

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.750 
that Dustin anyway I hope that was
useful

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.820 

you
