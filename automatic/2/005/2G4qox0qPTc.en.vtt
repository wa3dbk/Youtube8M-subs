so<00:00:03.720> here<00:00:04.319> I'm<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.740> show<00:00:04.890> how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:06.170> look<00:00:07.170> at

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
so here I'm going to show how to look at

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.499 
so here I'm going to show how to look at
the<00:00:08.389> flight<00:00:09.389> data<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.469> arducopter<00:00:11.509> I'm

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the flight data from the arducopter I'm

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.079 
the flight data from the arducopter I'm
going<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> go<00:00:12.809> into<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.740> logs<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:15.030> were

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
going to go into the logs that were

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.840 
going to go into the logs that were
created<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.020> downloaded<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.220> mission

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
created and downloaded from mission

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.010 
created and downloaded from mission
planner<00:00:18.119> I've<00:00:19.050> put<00:00:19.080> them<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.650> folder<00:00:19.859> and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
planner I've put them in this folder and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.880 
planner I've put them in this folder and
what's<00:00:22.020> created<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:23.240> KMZ<00:00:24.240> file<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
what's created is a KMZ file that you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
what's created is a KMZ file that you
can<00:00:26.039> open<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.430> Google<00:00:26.760> Earth<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.900> other

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
can open with Google Earth and the other

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.429 
can open with Google Earth and the other
log<00:00:28.349> files<00:00:29.000> which<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.300> opened<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.779> Excel

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
log files which can be opened with Excel

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.940 
log files which can be opened with Excel
notepad<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> mission<00:00:32.850> planner<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:34.320> first

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
notepad or the mission planner so first

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.900 
notepad or the mission planner so first
I'm<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.430> open<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.210> Google<00:00:36.780> Earth

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
I'm going to go open up in Google Earth

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.130 
I'm going to go open up in Google Earth
the<00:00:38.910> flight<00:00:39.450> path<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:41.430> taken<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:45.140> here

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the flight path that was taken and here

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
the flight path that was taken and here
we<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:48.110> I'm<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> park<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:52.760> we<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.969> pan

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
we can see I'm at a park and we can pan

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
we can see I'm at a park and we can pan
to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> side<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.820> see<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:58.230> KMZ

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to the side here and see that the KMZ

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.219 
to the side here and see that the KMZ
file<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.789> elevation<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.070> lat<00:01:02.070> long<00:01:02.340> data

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
file has elevation and lat long data

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.859 
file has elevation and lat long data
which<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:05.280> nice<00:01:05.580> gives<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> really

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
which is pretty nice gives you a really

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.070 
which is pretty nice gives you a really
nice<00:01:07.140> feel<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.630> happening

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
nice feel for for what was happening

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.850 
nice feel for for what was happening
during<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> flight<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> also<00:01:13.520> add<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
during the flight and you can also add a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.090 
during the flight and you can also add a
an<00:01:16.860> elevation<00:01:17.820> profile<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.590> over<00:01:19.680> here

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
an elevation profile if we go over here

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.060 
an elevation profile if we go over here
and<00:01:20.689> show<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> elevation<00:01:22.350> profile<00:01:24.320> here<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and show the elevation profile here it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
and show the elevation profile here it
shows<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.939> had<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> maximum<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.790> about<00:01:30.110> fifty<00:01:31.110> six

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
shows I had a maximum of about fifty six

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.960 
shows I had a maximum of about fifty six
twenty-six<00:01:31.829> feet<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.329> minimum<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> 50<00:01:34.290> 385

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
twenty-six feet and a minimum of 50 385

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.230 
twenty-six feet and a minimum of 50 385
so<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> gives<00:01:36.299> us<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.860> think<00:01:37.880> about<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> two

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so it gives us I think about a two

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
so it gives us I think about a two
hundred<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.600> forty<00:01:41.240> foot<00:01:42.710> elevation

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
hundred and forty foot elevation

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.910 
hundred and forty foot elevation
difference<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.930> peak<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.500> probably

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
difference so that peak was probably

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.819 
difference so that peak was probably
around<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.750> two<00:01:48.899> hundred<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.290> forty<00:01:49.619> foot

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
around that two hundred and forty foot

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.789 
around that two hundred and forty foot
mark<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:52.880> for<00:01:53.880> looking<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> log<00:01:54.960> data<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mark and for looking at the log data I

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
mark and for looking at the log data I
think<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> easiest<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
think the easiest thing right now is

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.980 
think the easiest thing right now is
just<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> open<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.990> mission

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
just to open it up in the mission

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
just to open it up in the mission
planner<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> go<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.450> terminal<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.789> will

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
planner so go into the terminal and will

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789 
planner so go into the terminal and will

change to the appropriate deals and we

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.920 
change to the appropriate deals and we

altitude<00:03:48.439> and<00:03:48.709> we<00:03:49.069> can<00:03:49.250> plot<00:03:49.459> all<00:03:49.729> of<00:03:50.269> these<00:03:50.449> so

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
altitude and we can plot all of these so

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.710 
altitude and we can plot all of these so
like<00:03:51.829> plotting<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.340> time<00:03:52.609> with<00:03:53.329> that<00:03:53.509> cell

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
like plotting the time with that cell

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.479 
like plotting the time with that cell
highlighted<00:03:54.229> we<00:03:54.319> can<00:03:54.530> go<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.709> graph<00:03:54.979> this<00:03:55.189> data

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
highlighted we can go to graph this data

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.050 
highlighted we can go to graph this data
and<00:03:56.530> get<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> nice<00:03:57.739> graph<00:03:58.040> of<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.400> data<00:03:58.639> of<00:03:58.879> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
and get a nice graph of the data of the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.439 
and get a nice graph of the data of the
time<00:03:59.500> if<00:04:00.500> we<00:04:00.620> clear<00:04:00.859> that<00:04:01.040> graph<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:01.729> can<00:04:01.759> graph

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
time if we clear that graph we can graph

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:08.189 
time if we clear that graph we can graph
the<00:04:02.989> latitude<00:04:05.049> as<00:04:06.049> well<00:04:06.379> as<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.889> longitude

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
the latitude as well as the longitude

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:13.890 
the latitude as well as the longitude
will<00:04:09.199> clear<00:04:09.439> that<00:04:09.680> open<00:04:10.489> up<00:04:10.609> this<00:04:10.790> cell<00:04:12.549> and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
will clear that open up this cell and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.999 
will clear that open up this cell and
let's<00:04:14.900> say<00:04:15.049> if<00:04:15.169> we<00:04:15.290> wanted<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> look<00:04:15.739> at<00:04:15.799> the

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
let's say if we wanted to look at the

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.840 
let's say if we wanted to look at the
GPS<00:04:16.519> altitude

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.430 

and<00:04:20.540> this<00:04:21.020> graph<00:04:21.709> should<00:04:22.130> look<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.370> lot<00:04:22.520> like

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
and this graph should look a lot like

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.690 
and this graph should look a lot like
this<00:04:24.440> elevation<00:04:25.430> profile<00:04:28.720> which<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:30.700> believe

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
this elevation profile which I believe

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.750 
this elevation profile which I believe
it<00:04:31.820> does<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.570> those<00:04:36.020> are<00:04:36.170> some<00:04:36.200> helpful

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
it does so those are some helpful

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.100 
it does so those are some helpful
helpful<00:04:37.760> things<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.480> looking<00:04:38.630> at<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.900> flight

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
helpful things and looking at the flight
