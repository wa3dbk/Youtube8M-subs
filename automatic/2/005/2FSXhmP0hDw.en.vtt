00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.260
 good everyone to a good new video 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.589
 as you already know one of the great 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.750
 incentives of gta 5 was the theme of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.790
 monkeys I started on the subject of the mods and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.170
 others apart from having in the game for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 the people who had a pc but not a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 console because another reason was the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.020
 this put different mods to the game 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.460
 to extend the gameplay and good 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 create totally incredible things 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.420
 fun and different magnitudes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 it seems that rockstar is not very 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.650
 work of this kind of thing and good 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 as indicated by different models and others 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.320
 the last patch he has fucked a great 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 part of these things and others I do not know 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 how much because I keep very well 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.860
 the technicalities and this kind of thing 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.140
 but it seems that even the rockstar 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.270
 I'd say it would be and because no 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 It is clear at all but there are already several 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.790
 people who have received a 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 reprimand or even a ban 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.660
 within the game within online gta 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.989
 we could say no for the use of mods 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.270
 to which I say that you have carefully 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.230
 at the time of using them sincerely 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.390
 we have 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.310
 I do not know how much 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.190
 this breaks with the rules and so on but 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.820
 according to rockstar because all this breaks 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.260
 with the conditions of use 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.050
 with the conditions of use of the service 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.020
 with which I do not know if you are going to use 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.790
 mods I think on the subject of gta 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 then you should not enter and so on 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.960
 or something like that the truth 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 that's good, I do not think it feels 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940
 well in the users and it would be good to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.420
 rockstar will push a platform 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.180
 of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.430
 of mods and others not like others have 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.799
 games and others to install the easy ones 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.259
 to create a community there that believes and 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.880
 all this and make it more accessible than 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.100
 is going to make people look for themselves 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.780
 life to get them and others like it 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.330
 for example I love you to symbolize what 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.500
 could do and put different ways in 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.270
 the workshop this destination and that many 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.340
 other games have like skyrim and others 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.320
 but well I do not know I do not know if what 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.430
 will implement in gta 5 or what will happen or if 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.769
 is implemented within the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.970
 impotence I think not but if it were 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.140
 implemented and is worth taking action for 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.480
 I would have many games but 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.489
 well it would be pretty good as I say 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 so well nothing more guys I do not know 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.090
 the speed of these emails like 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.890
 I always tell you when not celebrations 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.430
 one hundred percent I do not say it but I 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 it is quite suspicious what until 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 the forums from 7 to 5 in the forums 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.260
 officers because people with officers do not 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.970
 1 were very famous in gta five forms 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.799
 gta way they are highly 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 scrutinizing that one or the other 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.000
 they are driving so good nothing else 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.720
 guys you have to give him the warning 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 until next time
