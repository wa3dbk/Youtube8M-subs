00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850

most<00:03:41.080> commonly<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.500> think<00:03:41.740> it's<00:03:41.890> playing<00:03:42.370> it

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
most commonly I think it's playing it

using fingers one two and three but most

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.020 
using fingers one two and three but most
of<00:03:44.860> these<00:03:44.980> grips<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.459> know<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.640> can<00:03:45.880> change

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
of these grips you know you can change

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.180 
of these grips you know you can change
the<00:03:46.240> fingering<00:03:46.600> around<00:03:46.810> till<00:03:47.380> relatively

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
the fingering around till relatively

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.330 
the fingering around till relatively
simple<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:49.300> that<00:03:49.570> would<00:03:49.750> be<00:03:49.930> our<00:03:49.959> ecord<00:03:50.800> now

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
simple so that would be our ecord now

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.150 
simple so that would be our ecord now

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.510

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
fingers one two and three but I really

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.830 
fingers one two and three but I really
struggle<00:04:27.910> with<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.300> try<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:28.720> my

struggle with that to try and get my

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.110 
struggle with that to try and get my
fingers<00:04:29.200> in<00:04:29.229> there<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.979> could<00:04:30.250> use<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.820> kind

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
fingers in there you could use the kind

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.730 
fingers in there you could use the kind
of<00:04:31.270> an<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.540> grip<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.169> teach<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.710> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
of an a grip that I teach in the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.920 
of an a grip that I teach in the
beginners<00:04:33.250> course<00:04:33.490> if<00:04:33.940> using<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.450> second

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
beginners course if using the second

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.409 
beginners course if using the second
finger<00:04:35.260> on<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.410> on<00:04:35.919> string<00:04:36.640> four<00:04:36.910> first

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
finger on the on string four first

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.860 
finger on the on string four first
finger<00:04:37.900> underneath<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.880> second<00:04:40.510> fret<00:04:40.690> of

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
finger underneath on the second fret of

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.719 
finger underneath on the second fret of
the<00:04:40.900> third<00:04:41.200> string<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.770> then<00:04:41.919> third<00:04:42.280> finger

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
the third string and then third finger

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.159 
the third string and then third finger
on<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.530> second<00:04:44.530> fret<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.010> second<00:04:45.790> string

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
on the second fret of the second string

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.659 
on the second fret of the second string
but<00:04:47.169> again<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.500> feels<00:04:47.650> quite<00:04:48.010> difficult<00:04:48.220> just

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
but again it feels quite difficult just

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.860 
but again it feels quite difficult just
because<00:04:48.820> those<00:04:48.940> fingers<00:04:49.360> are<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.510> lot<00:04:49.690> bigger

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
because those fingers are a lot bigger

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.230 
because those fingers are a lot bigger
so<00:04:50.140> I<00:04:50.350> kind<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.950> recommend<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.700> instance

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
so I kind of recommend in this instance

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.810 
so I kind of recommend in this instance
using<00:04:52.600> fingers<00:04:52.930> two<00:04:53.140> three<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.530> four<00:04:53.820> but

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
using fingers two three and four but

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.340 
using fingers two three and four but
again<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.180> might<00:04:55.300> try<00:04:55.570> some<00:04:55.780> other<00:04:55.930> stuff<00:04:56.200> I

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
again you might try some other stuff I

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.580 
again you might try some other stuff I
see<00:04:56.530> some<00:04:56.800> guys<00:04:57.010> doing<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.400> a<00:04:57.550> little<00:04:57.790> bar<00:04:58.590> like

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
see some guys doing is a little bar like

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.780 
see some guys doing is a little bar like
that<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.919> can<00:05:00.070> get<00:05:00.340> away<00:05:00.430> with<00:05:00.700> that

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
that you can get away with that

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.870 
that you can get away with that
sometimes<00:05:01.470> using<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.530> second<00:05:02.919> second<00:05:03.400> second

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880

right length of bar there which can be a

I<00:05:57.930> tend<00:05:58.290> to<00:05:58.470> use<00:05:58.560> most<00:05:59.130> often<00:05:59.400> with<00:06:00.120> this

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
I tend to use most often with this

wondering what happened to B because

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.460 
wondering what happened to B because
we've<00:06:14.460> looked<00:06:14.669> at<00:06:14.820> C<00:06:15.030> major<00:06:15.270> D<00:06:15.450> major<00:06:15.870> E<00:06:16.200> major

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
we've looked at C major D major E major

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.000 
we've looked at C major D major E major
F<00:06:16.770> major<00:06:16.800> G<00:06:17.220> major<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:18.030> major<00:06:18.419> but<00:06:18.810> not<00:06:19.050> B<00:06:19.290> well<00:06:19.979> B

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
F major G major a major but not B well B

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.070 
F major G major a major but not B well B
is<00:06:20.190> kind<00:06:20.610> of<00:06:20.760> like<00:06:20.910> a<00:06:20.940> little<00:06:21.300> bar<00:06:21.570> chord<00:06:21.870> it's

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
is kind of like a little bar chord it's

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.020 
is kind of like a little bar chord it's
a<00:06:22.139> little<00:06:22.410> trickier<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.070> it's<00:06:23.370> a<00:06:23.490> movable

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
a little trickier and it's a movable

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.640 
a little trickier and it's a movable
chord<00:06:24.510> shape<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.020> that's<00:06:25.139> something<00:06:25.410> that

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
chord shape so that's something that

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.170 
chord shape so that's something that
we're<00:06:25.740> going<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.919> be<00:06:26.010> looking<00:06:26.370> at<00:06:26.520> in<00:06:26.669> a<00:06:26.789> future
