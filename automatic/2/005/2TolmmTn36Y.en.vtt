00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
features of the pedals and whatnot so I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.929 
features of the pedals and whatnot so I
thought<00:00:28.369> I'd<00:00:28.460> do<00:00:28.550> something<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.849> little

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
thought I'd do something a little

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.060 
thought I'd do something a little
different<00:00:29.419> I<00:00:29.570> thought<00:00:30.470> I'd<00:00:30.560> just<00:00:30.650> record<00:00:31.009> a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
different I thought I'd just record a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.619 
different I thought I'd just record a
track<00:00:31.310> using<00:00:31.760> these<00:00:31.850> pedals<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:32.300> got<00:00:32.449> inspired

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
track using these pedals I got inspired

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.150 
track using these pedals I got inspired
by<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.019> pebbles<00:00:33.379> wrote<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.830> piece<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.040> music

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
by the pebbles wrote a piece of music

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.960 
by the pebbles wrote a piece of music
and<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:35.269> that's<00:00:35.840> what<00:00:35.960> you're<00:00:36.080> going<00:00:36.199> to<00:00:36.260> hear

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
and and that's what you're going to hear

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.660 
and and that's what you're going to hear
so<00:00:38.140> basically<00:00:39.140> I<00:00:39.260> also<00:00:39.440> used<00:00:40.100> clothes<00:00:40.460> back

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
so basically I also used clothes back

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.220 
so basically I also used clothes back
cabinets<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:41.269> heads<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.660> noticed<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:41.989> lot<00:00:42.140> of

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
cabinets and heads I noticed a lot of

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.470 
cabinets and heads I noticed a lot of
the<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.400> existing<00:00:43.400> vogner<00:00:43.760> demos<00:00:44.059> use<00:00:44.269> like

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
the the existing vogner demos use like

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.049 
the the existing vogner demos use like
combo<00:00:44.839> amps<00:00:45.140> like<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.489> Fender<00:00:46.489> Deluxe<00:00:46.519> reverb

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059

and<00:00:47.210> things<00:00:47.330> like<00:00:47.480> that<00:00:47.540> so<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.140> thought<00:00:48.649> I'd

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
and things like that so I thought I'd

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.510 
and things like that so I thought I'd

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
use some clean heads into closed back

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.740 
use some clean heads into closed back
cabinet<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:53.149> do<00:00:53.270> something<00:00:53.450> a<00:00:53.570> little
