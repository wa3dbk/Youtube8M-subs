00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Brazil is the country where the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.540
 most electronic games in the world 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.000
 last year 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.550
 in this computer-graphics school 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 students learn during class to do 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 what they like to use on the spot 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.250
 of recreation the videogames 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.689
 victor is a voracious consumer spending and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 duck every month 150 for 5 and you want 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 gamer even no matter what price you go 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.719
 the game if you like and go out spending a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.510
 A study with manufacturers showed that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.430
 sales of games and equipment 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 amounted to 1 billion and 600 million 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.010
 last year as long as this 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.530
 market shrank in most countries. 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 here in Brazil there was a growth of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 60% compared to 2011 a new 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 generation of games and consoles took over 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 of the market in 2012 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.879
 some models even got cheaper 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.149
 but according to research consumers 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 Brazilians remain willing to spend 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 whatever it takes to have it in your hands 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 that latest release accessory that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 makes the video game even more 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.790
 interesting reasons for the expansion in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 Brazil experts to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 installation of two large manufacturers 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.210
 in the country has cheapened 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.299
 equipment and games 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 the local manufacture of the consoles and also 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.299
 of games is to allow a reduction of up to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 40% on the final consumer price and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.460
 ease of purchase in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.070
 retailing and reducing piracy also 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.100
 has had a positive impact on the market 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.509
 games and every dollar invested and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 official software injects $ 437 into 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.399
 there is a need for you to be able to 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.009
 play online with your friends or with up 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.290
 people from all over the world 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.180
 need you to use the game 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.219
 original on the console so I think the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 two-sided price drop campaign 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.940
 marketing and the technology of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 consoles that favor consumption 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.750
 of original games
