00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.500 
scanpan you don't have to use oil I like
to<00:04:21.799> put<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.070> little<00:04:22.130> bit<00:04:22.430> on<00:04:22.610> there<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:23.330> just

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
to put a little bit on there it just

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.850 
to put a little bit on there it just
seems<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.900> make<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.050> easier<00:04:24.410> to<00:04:24.470> kind<00:04:24.650> of<00:04:24.740> move

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
seems to make it easier to kind of move

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.610 
seems to make it easier to kind of move
things<00:04:25.130> around<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.630> we've<00:04:26.720> got<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.840> little<00:04:27.290> bit

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
things around so we've got a little bit

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.620 
things around so we've got a little bit
of<00:04:27.650> olive<00:04:27.800> oil<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.310> there<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:29.420> see

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
of olive oil on there and you can see

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.150 
of olive oil on there and you can see
how<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.780> brush<00:04:29.990> gets<00:04:30.260> down<00:04:30.440> in<00:04:30.620> between<00:04:30.770> the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
how the brush gets down in between the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720 
how the brush gets down in between the
actual<00:04:31.640> grill<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.680> pretty<00:04:34.520> hot

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
actual grill and this is pretty hot

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.670 
actual grill and this is pretty hot
grill<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.570> we<00:04:35.690> should<00:04:35.720> get<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.140> nice<00:04:36.350> sizzle

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
grill so we should get some nice sizzle

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.190 
grill so we should get some nice sizzle
and<00:04:37.040> we<00:04:37.610> should<00:04:37.850> get<00:04:38.060> some<00:04:38.750> nice<00:04:38.930> grill<00:04:39.140> marks

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
and we should get some nice grill marks

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:53.439 
and we should get some nice grill marks
as<00:04:39.590> well

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.149 

I'm<00:04:53.990> going<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.259> cook<00:04:54.379> these<00:04:54.559> for<00:04:54.830> three

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
I'm going to cook these for three

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.179 
I'm going to cook these for three
minutes<00:04:55.370> per<00:04:55.759> side<00:04:55.870> but<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:56.900> also<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.740> cook

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
this side so not only top and bottom but

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.980 
this side so not only top and bottom but
I<00:05:01.430> like<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:01.669> go<00:05:01.879> around<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.300> cook<00:05:02.419> besides<00:05:02.779> a

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
little bit so that you cook off some of

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.760 
little bit so that you cook off some of
that<00:05:04.909> fat<00:05:05.330> because<00:05:05.539> unless<00:05:06.199> you<00:05:06.379> trim<00:05:06.620> off

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
some of this fat lamb tends to have that

some of this fat lamb tends to have that
that<00:05:09.439> real<00:05:09.650> richness<00:05:09.889> on<00:05:10.249> the<00:05:10.309> side<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.669> can

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
that real richness on the side you can

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.480 
that real richness on the side you can
see<00:05:10.849> it<00:05:11.059> on<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.300> piece<00:05:11.539> right<00:05:11.659> here<00:05:12.309> so<00:05:13.309> we're

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
see it on this piece right here so we're

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.679 
see it on this piece right here so we're
going<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.669> let<00:05:13.729> these<00:05:13.879> cook<00:05:14.150> now<00:05:14.360> for<00:05:14.599> about

three<00:05:15.050> minutes<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.529> then<00:05:15.800> we'll<00:05:15.949> give<00:05:16.129> them<00:05:16.219> a

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
three minutes and then we'll give them a

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.550 
three minutes and then we'll give them a
little<00:05:16.699> flip

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.650 

and<00:05:21.560> now<00:05:21.770> we're<00:05:21.980> flipping<00:05:22.130> these<00:05:22.430> over<00:05:22.850> in

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
and now we're flipping these over in

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.210

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
now I've got him just kind of sitting up

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.890 
now I've got him just kind of sitting up
on<00:05:32.310> their<00:05:32.460> ends<00:05:32.610> like<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:32.910> was<00:05:33.060> talking<00:05:33.390> about<00:05:33.450> I

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
on their ends like I was talking about I

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.710 
on their ends like I was talking about I
put<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.380> fat<00:05:34.560> side<00:05:34.800> down<00:05:34.830> first<00:05:35.160> usually<00:05:35.720> kind

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
put the fat side down first usually kind

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.840 
put the fat side down first usually kind
of<00:05:36.870> depends<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:38.190> I'm<00:05:38.340> just<00:05:38.460> going<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.670> rotate

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
of depends and I'm just going to rotate

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.190 
of depends and I'm just going to rotate
them<00:05:39.150> around<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:39.630> that<00:05:39.660> everything<00:05:39.960> gets

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
them around so that everything gets

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.240 
them around so that everything gets
cooked<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.770> like<00:05:41.700> my<00:05:41.940> lamb<00:05:42.860> pretty<00:05:43.860> much<00:05:44.040> on<00:05:44.220> the

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
rare side if you don't you can cook it a

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.660 
rare side if you don't you can cook it a
little<00:05:48.180> bit<00:05:48.450> longer<00:05:49.130> I'll<00:05:50.130> show<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.430> what<00:05:50.550> I'm

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.760 
little bit longer I'll show you what I'm
talking<00:05:50.700> about<00:05:51.120> see<00:05:51.810> that's<00:05:52.020> fairly<00:05:52.320> soft

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
talking about see that's fairly soft

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.230 
talking about see that's fairly soft
that's<00:05:53.130> going<00:05:53.310> to<00:05:53.370> be<00:05:53.460> pretty<00:05:53.610> rare<00:05:53.970> in<00:05:54.000> the

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
that's going to be pretty rare in the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.560 
that's going to be pretty rare in the
middle<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:56.160> harder<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.670> is<00:05:56.700> or<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.240> printer

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
middle the harder it is or the printer

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.660 
middle the harder it is or the printer
the<00:05:57.690> piece<00:05:57.900> is<00:05:58.200> it's<00:05:58.890> not<00:05:59.100> going<00:05:59.280> to<00:05:59.370> be<00:05:59.430> quite

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
the piece is it's not going to be quite

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.370 
the piece is it's not going to be quite
a<00:05:59.700> soft<00:06:00.060> all<00:06:00.360> of<00:06:00.600> these<00:06:00.720> are<00:06:00.870> pretty<00:06:01.050> much<00:06:01.200> on

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
a soft all of these are pretty much on

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.660 
a soft all of these are pretty much on
the<00:06:01.500> rear<00:06:01.650> side<00:06:01.680> now<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.220> I<00:06:02.400> can<00:06:02.580> tell

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.460 

tonight<00:06:07.300> think<00:06:07.510> about<00:06:07.660> these<00:06:07.780> grill<00:06:08.050> pans<00:06:08.290> as

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
tonight think about these grill pans as

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.550 
tonight think about these grill pans as
you<00:06:08.590> can<00:06:08.740> barbecue<00:06:09.280> in<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.030> middle<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.300> winter

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
you can barbecue in the middle of winter

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.870 
you can barbecue in the middle of winter
so<00:06:11.560> if<00:06:11.830> you're<00:06:11.980> on<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.160> East<00:06:12.340> Coast<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:14.410> can

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
so if you're on the East Coast you can

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.700 
so if you're on the East Coast you can
still<00:06:15.880> do<00:06:16.030> your<00:06:16.060> no<00:06:16.540> barbecued<00:06:17.110> salmon<00:06:17.380> or

still do your no barbecued salmon or

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.070 
still do your no barbecued salmon or
your<00:06:17.860> barbecued<00:06:18.370> lamb<00:06:18.490> like<00:06:19.060> this<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.570> has

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080
