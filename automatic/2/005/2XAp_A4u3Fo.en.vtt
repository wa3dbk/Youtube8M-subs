everything has these days I'll plug that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.070 
everything has these days I'll plug that
back<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:22.789> like<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
back in there like so now this is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.859 
back in there like so now this is
converted<00:00:25.650> radio<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> Roberts<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.720> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
converted radio this was a Roberts as it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.009 
converted radio this was a Roberts as it
says<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> packet<00:00:29.660> these<00:00:30.660> were<00:00:30.840> made<00:00:30.990> in

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
says on the packet these were made in

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.220 
says on the packet these were made in
the<00:00:31.470> late<00:00:31.920> seventies<00:00:32.430> early<00:00:32.579> eighties<00:00:33.230> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the late seventies early eighties and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.930 
the late seventies early eighties and
this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> probably<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.890> 30<00:00:35.250> years<00:00:35.489> old

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this is probably about 30 years old

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
this is probably about 30 years old
now<00:00:36.360> I've<00:00:36.480> kept<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> cabinet<00:00:37.200> exactly<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
now I've kept the cabinet exactly as it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.660 
now I've kept the cabinet exactly as it
was<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.640> made<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> radio<00:00:40.579> but<00:00:41.579> I've

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
was when it was made as a radio but I've

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.250 
was when it was made as a radio but I've
ripped<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> guts<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
ripped the guts out of it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
ripped the guts out of it
the<00:00:43.620> controls<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.190> still<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the controls are still all there the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
the controls are still all there the
on/off<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.600> acts<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> an<00:00:46.079> on/off<00:00:46.309> they

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
on/off to do acts is an on/off they

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.130 
on/off to do acts is an on/off they
volume<00:00:47.670> control<00:00:48.030> acts<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> volume<00:00:48.750> control

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
volume control acts as a volume control

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.189 
volume control acts as a volume control
the<00:00:49.649> tuner<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.399> still<00:00:50.879> works<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.989> doesn't

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the tuner just still works but doesn't

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.810 
the tuner just still works but doesn't
do<00:00:52.289> anything<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.280> area<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.670> still

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
do anything and the area will still

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.510 
do anything and the area will still
works<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.329> well<00:00:54.620> it's<00:00:55.620> also<00:00:55.770> got<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> turntable

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
works as well it's also got a turntable

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.770 
works as well it's also got a turntable
that's<00:00:56.789> why<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.059> wobbly<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> because

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that's why it's wobbly like that because

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
that's why it's wobbly like that because
these<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.079> turntables<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.980> strong

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
these have turntables to get strong

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.630 
these have turntables to get strong
signals<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> carry<00:01:01.410> handle<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
signals and it's got a carry handle so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.009 
signals and it's got a carry handle so
you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.760> carry<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.690> battery

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you can carry it about it's all battery

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.130 
you can carry it about it's all battery
operated<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> plug<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.600> iPod<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
here switch you on let me just bend down

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
here switch you on let me just bend down
here<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:13.130> music<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:15.780> won't<00:01:15.960> get

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here and put some music on you won't get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.070 
here and put some music on you won't get
a<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.310> idea<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.880> quality<00:01:18.840> because

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
a good idea of the quality because

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
a good idea of the quality because
obviously<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.619> recording<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> through<00:01:20.430> an

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
obviously I'm recording it through an

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:32.200 
obviously I'm recording it through an
iPad

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.060 

inside<00:01:33.210> I've<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.479> our<00:01:33.840> 20<00:01:34.530> watt<00:01:36.320> expect<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.710> 20

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
inside I've got our 20 watt expect a 20

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.320 
inside I've got our 20 watt expect a 20
watt<00:01:38.100> amplifier<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:40.189> I've<00:01:41.189> built<00:01:41.820> into<00:01:42.149> this

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
watt amplifier and I've built into this

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.380 
watt amplifier and I've built into this
a<00:01:42.649> good<00:01:43.649> quality<00:01:44.039> German<00:01:44.729> speaker<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a good quality German speaker which is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.170 
a good quality German speaker which is
20<00:01:45.869> watt<00:01:46.020> braided<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> 30<00:01:47.280> watt<00:01:47.369> peak<00:01:47.789> so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
20 watt braided with a 30 watt peak so

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.840 
20 watt braided with a 30 watt peak so
it'll<00:01:49.049> handle<00:01:49.259> quite<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> lot<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> volume<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it'll handle quite a lot of volume the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
it'll handle quite a lot of volume the
only<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> holds<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
only thing that holds it back is the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.270 
only thing that holds it back is the
amount<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> batteries<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.039> there<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
amount of batteries in there at the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.450 
amount of batteries in there at the
moment<00:01:53.640> I've<00:01:53.759> got<00:01:54.350> six<00:01:55.350> batteries<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.189> here

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
moment I've got six batteries in here

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.270 
moment I've got six batteries in here
six<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.750> should<00:01:58.049> double<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.470> upwards<00:01:58.830> 12

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
six is I should double that upwards 12

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
six is I should double that upwards 12
hours<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.850> we<00:01:59.909> will<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.720> will<00:02:00.840> give<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hours now we will do that will give you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
hours now we will do that will give you
full<00:02:01.590> volume<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.429> won't<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.789> stall<00:02:02.970> at

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
full volume and it won't just stall at

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.660 
full volume and it won't just stall at
full<00:02:03.270> volume<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.069> say<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
full volume it's as I say that the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
full volume it's as I say that the
cabinet<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.600> came<00:02:06.750> out<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.049> factory

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
cabinet is as it came out of the factory

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.009 
cabinet is as it came out of the factory
it's<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.450> touch<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.660> top<00:02:09.810> I've<00:02:09.869> just

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
it's not gonna touch the top I've just

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's not gonna touch the top I've just
cleaned<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.950> got<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> little<00:02:11.310> mark<00:02:11.489> on
