00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.870
 if you used to be a little faster 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.580
 wanted to make a hatchback then you had 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.040
 really just a consideration just one 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.029
 thick potent engine front nose and 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.260
 were you ready 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.360
 nowadays that story doesn't go 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.770
 along because anno 2015 is a low one 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.720
 emissions of vital importance 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.099
 and so it is just as important what 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.990
 comes from the exhaust or rather 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.730
 what doesn't come out 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.500
 and so you get cars that and health 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.570
 have parkas and yet are full of 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.640
 all kinds of fuel-saving measures 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 volkswagen already had it with the polo blue 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.260
 GT and it has just had a facelift 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.850
 and now does not have 140 hp 150 hp 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.980
 and that's just in time because ford jumps 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.539
 now the fiesta red edition on the market with 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.359
 a 140 hp strong 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.980
 In short, just 1 liter of ecoboost 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.329
 then nice and smooth 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.859
 then the question works that in practice 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.859
 and it is also a bit fun 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.300
 oh shit to live 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 well in the case of that fiesta it is 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.010
 pretty nice drive 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.750
 it is equipped with the well-known 1 liter 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.760
 threees and the ecoboost engine 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 small turbo and that's one anyway 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.790
 motor that is nice and enthusiastic 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.070
 diesel in the pick it up just nice 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.750
 is a nice closure and then they have 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 tickle turbo pressure is still running a bit 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.130
 inject slightly increased with adjusted and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.330
 then the summer comes 140 hp 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.210
 it is very much natural for a 1 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.280
 liters and you notice that he sounds 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.720
 what less than the direct predecessor that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.210
 was dealing with an atmospheric one 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 princess and this yes it's a funny one 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.149
 but really spectacular 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.160
 it never what you get in return 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.179
 is so much more pulling power in it 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.590
 middle area 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.210
 those with then you really need work numbers 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.030
 you keep exactly in the right area then 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.500
 you better this in everything above the two and 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.330
 half past three thousand rpm then he goes 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.289
 just nice in such a nice roll 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.850
 is linked to a manual transmission 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.130
 five-speed 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.050
 is niels most modern of the most modern it 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.600
 is a nice switch the bakery 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.950
 really goes some butter so it's fine that 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.240
 So one on the square is your best 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.830
 are involved in the work that you really do 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.110
 nice to get started and that is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.369
 nice that also applies to the chassis 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.170
 it is slightly tighter than normal 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.850
 fiesta well that already quite well 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.100
 enthusiastic driving car 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.720
 for such a small thing this yes is just 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.549
 what sharp easier to the 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.290
 inside of the were on butt 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.910
 also nice and loose your thinking let go of gas 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.930
 half way the curves floor mat a bit 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.220
 put 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 it's just nice it really makes you 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.030
 is going to play with this car 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.950
 so driving pleasure he has some 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.170
 what strikes a bit he has 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.400
 behind drum brakes and if you really go 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.290
 working with this car is you going 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.910
 brake harder 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.530
 brand to the devils who are very 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.640
 very hot and then they also start something 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.440
 lose their braking effect 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.020
 well it is of course no hardcore gti 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.700
 it is not nearly as hard as it is through cst 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 then this red edition is exactly 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.420
 the kind just not gti 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.310
 that you pretend to be so that is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.820
 nice polo 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.820
 young bad 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.040
 yes the polo is just real stoneware and 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.450
 with that you actually have a little bit 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.610
 said this car is very bad 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.670
 perfectionist does everything so well 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.890
 possible but really nice that is it then 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.090
 again not really compared to yves 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.740
 First look at your 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.230
 lychee stiff muted even in the 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.400
 comfort mode you have adaptive dampers 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.590
 can then make another one with the push of a button 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.340
 make it harder but it will be him 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.420
 not real and playful car it is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.520
 well he goes just like that mumps 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.860
 lower fiesta and that while this something 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.300
 only has fewer sporting tires 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.740
 come you understand me the limits he goes 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.820
 slide over his nose 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.530
 let you go release it will come back 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.450
 and that's it then it's never real 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.220
 playful it's not i 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.010
 yes that playful that happy because that 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.660
 fiesta does have a bit less 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.680
 spectacular maybe that goes 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.840
 actually a bit for that too 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.040
 powertrain just via taizÃ© with 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.630
 7-stage DSG 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.010
 And yes there is simply no way out 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.050
 switch by hand 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.180
 7 gears so yes you just notice 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.520
 that you always have your power 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.989
 switches your 10 hp and 30 lightning fast 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.710
 minutes longer but the performance 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.200
 to be 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.060
 well if i give you 30hp more it is yes 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.530
 again very good at pinball 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.530
 yes that's nice then it responds very well 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.090
 well the flippers very very fast that 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.770
 handy not right that's nice the bee 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.210
 really working in this he is used to 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 somewhat more distant 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.120
 which is a funny addition 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.860
 see it on that ept 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.900
 cylinder shutdown so if you don't have to 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.970
 lots of torque used is just slow 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.650
 60 kilometers per hour runs constantly 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.940
 the link that switches cylinders 2 and 3 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.710
 he out then i need the other two 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.610
 cylinders work hard and they would 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 technically speaking 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.569
 being more efficient is funny 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.789
 addition and you drive a good part of it 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.199
 the time on two of four cylinders 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.520
 you could say on average 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.520
 the polo also has a three-cylinder 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.429
 what both of these cars can best be one 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.229
 hope to have fun and they are too 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.699
 both are serious slot for b-segment 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.860
 and if he is both also 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.309
 relatively economical because both the fiesta and 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.899
 the polo 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.759
 drive about one with normal use 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.409
 in four tens 1 in 15 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.149
 and that is neat is also not really 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.069
 big difference between what is a big one 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:31.959
 difference is the purchase price because 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.990
 this fiesta is as it is written here 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:37.059
 21,000 euros and that paolo 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.249
 just a little more 9000 euros more 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.749
 to be precise and that is a lot 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.189
 and then he has some option study vs 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.319
 not there but even if we have the 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.939
 pick up at the price difference of five and 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.189
 half a thousand euros 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.110
 that's a lot of money for sure because of the fiesta 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.330
 is just as much fun to drive 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.830
 And yes, he is definitely a bit advanced 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.499
 mechanically looks which more 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.330
 offers specific driving pleasure then it is 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:00.330
 the us are the absolute winner in this case
