00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
feel really unnatural to be just sort of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.749

in any capacity but but for me it feels

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.870 
in any capacity but but for me it feels
more<00:01:16.700> natural<00:01:16.759> than<00:01:18.429> talking<00:01:19.429> to<00:01:19.549> you<00:01:19.700> now

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
more natural than talking to you now

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.719 
more natural than talking to you now
oddly<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.899> always<00:01:21.799> dread<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:22.280> would<00:01:22.429> be<00:01:22.579> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
oddly I always dread that I would be the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.809 
oddly I always dread that I would be the
person<00:01:23.420> who<00:01:23.569> would<00:01:23.740> take<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.249> last<00:01:25.490> bow

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
person who would take like the last bow

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.349 
person who would take like the last bow

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
in a big hip show but I always had an

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.919 
in a big hip show but I always had an
inkling<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.749> I<00:01:29.959> would<00:01:30.109> probably<00:01:30.289> be<00:01:31.810> one<00:01:32.810> of

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
inkling that I would probably be one of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.559 
inkling that I would probably be one of
the<00:01:33.020> people<00:01:33.200> who<00:01:33.560> was<00:01:33.770> on<00:01:33.979> who<00:01:34.569> barreled

main dude comes down I never thought

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:40.629

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
anyway you know I guess Ruth and I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.260 
anyway you know I guess Ruth and I
probably<00:02:16.100> took<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> lot<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.820> praise<00:02:17.030> for

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
probably took a lot of the praise for

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.810 
probably took a lot of the praise for
that<00:02:17.360> show<00:02:17.570> because<00:02:17.960> we<00:02:18.530> wrote<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.550> we're

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
that show because we wrote it and we're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.450 
that show because we wrote it and we're
in<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.300> without<00:02:20.920> without<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.190> cast

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
in it but without without the cast

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.100 
in it but without without the cast
without<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.090> director<00:02:23.570> without<00:02:23.750> any<00:02:24.020> of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
without the director without any of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.380 
without the director without any of
those<00:02:24.200> people<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.800> wouldn't<00:02:24.980> have<00:02:25.250> there's<00:02:26.240> no

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
those people it wouldn't have there's no

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.050 
those people it wouldn't have there's no
way<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.690> would<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.810> been<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.020> hit<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.710> know

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
way it would have been a hit you know

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.620 
way it would have been a hit you know
but<00:02:29.060> my<00:02:29.240> biggest<00:02:29.720> thing<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:31.610> just<00:02:31.850> maximize

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
but my biggest thing is to just maximize

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.160 
but my biggest thing is to just maximize
fun<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.850> at<00:02:34.970> every<00:02:35.090> opportunity<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.930> can

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
fun like at every opportunity you can

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.350 
fun like at every opportunity you can
just<00:02:36.410> mean<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.100> can<00:02:37.220> get<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> maximum<00:02:38.120> fun

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
just mean if you can get the maximum fun

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.020 
just mean if you can get the maximum fun
out<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.600> stuff<00:02:39.010> then<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.130> was<00:02:40.340> great

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030
