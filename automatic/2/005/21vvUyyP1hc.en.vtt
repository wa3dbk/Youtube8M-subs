so I kept my pressure cooker on but not

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.120 
so I kept my pressure cooker on but not
cooking<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:38.960> put<00:02:39.200> though<00:02:39.350> I'm<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> simmer

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
cooking I put though I'm like a simmer

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.620 
cooking I put though I'm like a simmer
kind<00:02:40.520> of<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:41.080> soup<00:02:43.180> because<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.360> don't<00:02:44.510> want

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
kind of like a soup because I don't want

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.060 
kind of like a soup because I don't want
it<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.780> keep<00:02:44.960> cooking<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.560> if<00:02:45.620> you're<00:02:45.770> making

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
it to keep cooking but if you're making

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
it to keep cooking but if you're making
pork<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.760> guess<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.120> doesn't<00:02:47.270> really<00:02:47.450> matter

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.510 
because you can never have your pork to
cook<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:51.230> mine<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.590> beef<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.100> like<00:02:52.310> mine<00:02:52.490> a
