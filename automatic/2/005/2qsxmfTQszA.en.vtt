examples of beetles that we would find
in<00:01:31.369> our<00:01:31.550> landscape<00:01:32.179> are<00:01:32.390> lady<00:01:32.780> beetles<00:01:33.259> and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
in our landscape are lady beetles and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.770 
in our landscape are lady beetles and
ground<00:01:33.950> beetles<00:01:34.340> these<00:01:34.789> are<00:01:34.940> both<00:01:35.209> important

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
ground beetles these are both important

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.499 
ground beetles these are both important
predatory<00:01:36.410> insects<00:01:37.039> beetles<00:01:37.849> also<00:01:38.270> play

other roles in our environment including

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.089 
other roles in our environment including
their<00:01:40.880> role<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.239> decomposition<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.860> some

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
their role in decomposition and in some

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.830 
their role in decomposition and in some
case<00:01:43.369> some<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.640> these<00:01:43.910> groups<00:01:44.239> are<00:01:44.420> considered

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
case some of these groups are considered

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.710 
case some of these groups are considered
to<00:01:45.050> be<00:01:45.080> pests<00:01:45.500> for<00:01:46.039> example<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.090> white<00:01:47.330> grub

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
to be pests for example the white grub

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.830 
to be pests for example the white grub
this<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.380> an<00:01:48.500> example<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.190> an<00:01:49.340> immature<00:01:49.849> beetle

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
this is an example of an immature beetle

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.839 
this is an example of an immature beetle
the<00:01:51.500> second<00:01:51.920> group<00:01:52.069> that<00:01:52.250> we're<00:01:52.399> going<00:01:52.580> to

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
the second group that we're going to

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.120 
the second group that we're going to
discuss<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.599> order<00:01:53.989> Hymenoptera<00:01:54.289> which

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
discuss is the order Hymenoptera which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.969 
discuss is the order Hymenoptera which
includes<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.970> bees<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.780> wasps<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.800> ants

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
includes the bees the wasps and the ants

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.040 
includes the bees the wasps and the ants
when<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:58.729> talk<00:01:58.970> about<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.479> group<00:01:59.750> we<00:01:59.899> can

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
when we talk about this group we can

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.630 
when we talk about this group we can
really<00:02:00.349> divide<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.830> into<00:02:00.979> these<00:02:01.250> three

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
really divide it into these three

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.910 
really divide it into these three
subgroups<00:02:02.080> first<00:02:03.080> we'll<00:02:03.289> discuss<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
subgroups first we'll discuss the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.949 
subgroups first we'll discuss the
bumblebees<00:02:04.429> and<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.970> bees<00:02:05.209> the<00:02:05.479> first<00:02:05.780> thing

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
bumblebees and the bees the first thing

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.449 
bumblebees and the bees the first thing
that<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.170> notice<00:02:06.500> about<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:07.009> group<00:02:07.280> is

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
that you notice about this group is

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.249 
that you notice about this group is
their<00:02:07.849> hairy<00:02:08.179> bodies<00:02:08.690> another

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
their hairy bodies another

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.140 
their hairy bodies another
characteristic<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.610> bumblebees<00:02:11.120> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
characteristic of the bumblebees and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
characteristic of the bumblebees and
bees<00:02:11.629> is<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:11.900> they<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.379> a<00:02:12.410> chewing<00:02:12.890> lapping

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
bees is that they have a chewing lapping

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.280 
bees is that they have a chewing lapping
mouth<00:02:13.760> part<00:02:14.090> which<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.930> for<00:02:15.110> dual

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the wasps and the wasp also have the two

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.130 
the wasps and the wasp also have the two
pairs<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> membranous<00:02:42.540> wings

the other characteristic thing about the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.550 
the other characteristic thing about the
wasp<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.330> they<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.019> constriction

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
wasp is that they have this constriction

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
wasp is that they have this constriction

a fly let's say from the hymenopteran
that<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.919> discussed<00:03:53.430> many<00:03:54.329> times<00:03:54.660> they<00:03:54.930> may

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
that we discussed many times they may

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.259 
that we discussed many times they may
look<00:03:55.290> similar<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:56.130> appearance<00:03:56.340> because<00:03:57.120> we

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
look similar in appearance because we

leaf hoppers so as you might gather
insects<00:05:12.510> are<00:05:12.660> very<00:05:12.690> diverse<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.740> their

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.160 
insects are very diverse in their

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
that they play in our environment so

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.640 
that they play in our environment so
it's<00:05:18.300> very<00:05:18.570> important<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.140> we're<00:05:19.320> able<00:05:19.470> to

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
it's very important that we're able to

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.040 
it's very important that we're able to
accurately<00:05:20.520> identify<00:05:20.610> these<00:05:21.390> insects<00:05:21.900> so

accurately identify these insects so

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.630 
accurately identify these insects so
that<00:05:22.170> we<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.440> assess<00:05:22.770> their<00:05:23.010> roles<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.520> know

that we can assess their roles to know

conserve their populations because

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.730 
conserve their populations because
