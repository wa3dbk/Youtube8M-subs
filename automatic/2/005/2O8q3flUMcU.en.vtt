00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello, I am red, today I come to you. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.680
 a video about templates to make 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.680
 wicks or lightings I hope you like it 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.990
 good many of you have seen pictures 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.530
 in my Instagram 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.480
 on my twitter and facebook about the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 templates that I usually use when 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.930
 I make evaluations to my friends 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 I always use these that are 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.760
 made everything in this one that is made by me 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.550
 They are made with cellophane 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.920
 and a lot soon because he used this type 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.840
 of template and I do not use aluminum foil 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.600
 or foil as they say others 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.260
 and this is the most used is the most 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.740
 practical most recommended by the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.070
 Most hairdressers and stylists 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.680
 this conveys heat and helps accelerate 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.810
 much faster the clarification of the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.520
 hair because if it works it either 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.280
 work with dye so you work 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.610
 with decolouring is also that good 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.800
 avoid spilling the product and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.020
 has its advantages more work after 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.750
 clarify much more the hair of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.490
 way more quickly than for many 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.280
 hairdressers is practical because what 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.210
 they discard and no longer clean them 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.649
 they take time but if this one is like that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.930
 quicker good 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.090
 in my case it bothered me a bit to have 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.090
 to discard things like that for a subject 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.250
 of internal pollution savings but 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.759
 if it can be washed it can be cleaned and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.539
 can reuse now because usually 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.890
 I work with this type of template 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.170
 is that he is against the role of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.060
 aluminum because I used it 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.549
 I use it when the situation warrants it 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.929
 but usually my friends when they arrive 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.190
 they come with hair 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.050
 mistreated 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.660
 - scorched burnt hair 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.330
 destroyed in this type of hair 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.170
 it requires that one be much more careful 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.230
 much more friendly and this conveys less 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.630
 heat the process is slower ie 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 that are going to take longer but the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.780
 result is much more friendly but I 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.150
 forgive the redundancy is that the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.709
 competitivity not compromised hair 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:44.390
 that is, the hair stays healthier 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.220
 Busting it is not not not harm it 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.430
 well then that is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.760
 transparent, I 'm seeing how 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.010
 the color or the rinsing is evolving 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.380
 in the hair then this is one of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.610
 the reasons why I use this this 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.319
 kind of paper 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.930
 there is one that is like waxed that I 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.340
 I had before but I did not get it anymore here 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.300
 in venezuela 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.819
 and well I had that then they gave me 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.250
 I won many years ago with a house 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.080
 commercial in a contest because I was the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.780
 which got highest rating 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.450
 and they gave me a template in this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.280
 kind of material more or less and good me 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.830
 I had it headed and I started using it 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.780
 two years ago and wonderful but it 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.660
 weathered or washed it dry in the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.350
 clean the guard and it broke and well I 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.840
 they said that miami had and nothing and I 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.450
 They brought a little bit but I needed more 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 besides that I needed some long and 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.270
 I decided to do it myself I can do them 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.790
 a video of how I do them I buy the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.160
 paper this role in bookstores and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.630
 I make different sizes and well this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.150
 is the reason why why 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.459
 he used more this than the role of 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.380
 aluminum but really at the end of the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.360
 result at the level of clarification is 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.120
 Exactly the same, I think they vary 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.730
 as to summarize in time and that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.920
 he respects more the competitiveness of the 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.590
 hair 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.660
 I hope you liked this video today 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.970
 I will try to make one that others more 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.680
 discoloration lighting if there is any 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.690
 particular that you are interested in leaving me your 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.750
 comments if you liked this video of 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.500
 in like share in their social networks 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.930
 and do not forget that I have contests 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.760
 in the pending networks before 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.569
 finish and it's close to finish 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.360
 stop seeing it 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.009
 today I 'm going to make a video to you as a result of 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.469
 Many questions that you have asked me about 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.289
 whether or not they can use bleach to 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.289
 become illuminations or wicks
