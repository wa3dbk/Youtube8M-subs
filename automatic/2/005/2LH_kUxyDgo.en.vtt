00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.840 

one<00:00:01.200> of<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.410> things<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.890> had<00:00:02.100> certainly

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
one of the things you had certainly

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.610 
one of the things you had certainly
during<00:00:03.179> your<00:00:03.360> career<00:00:03.540> was<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> report<00:00:04.440> with<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
during your career was a report with a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.110 
during your career was a report with a
special<00:00:04.680> wide<00:00:05.190> receiver<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.730> I'm<00:00:05.850> thinking

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
special wide receiver and I'm thinking

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.369 
special wide receiver and I'm thinking
of<00:00:06.210> Michael<00:00:06.509> Irvin<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:06.990> I've<00:00:07.049> always<00:00:07.259> been

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
of Michael Irvin and I've always been

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.410 
of Michael Irvin and I've always been
interested<00:00:07.890> in<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.100> connection<00:00:08.430> that<00:00:09.240> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
interested in that connection that you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.940 
interested in that connection that you
have<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:10.019> wide<00:00:10.259> receiver<00:00:10.500> when<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950

guy's good enough to win on a particular

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.160 
guy's good enough to win on a particular
route<00:00:26.670> secondly<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.480> trust<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:27.840> he's<00:00:28.020> going

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
route secondly you trust that he's going

route secondly you trust that he's going
to<00:00:28.230> run<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.620> right<00:00:28.770> routes<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:30.300> thirdly

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
to run the right routes and then thirdly

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.999 
to run the right routes and then thirdly
he's<00:00:30.900> gonna<00:00:30.990> catch<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.470> ball<00:00:31.650> when<00:00:31.860> it's

thrown<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.309> his<00:00:32.430> direction<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.000> mean<00:00:33.120> those

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
thrown in his direction I mean those

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
thrown in his direction I mean those
things<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.020> important<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.680> there

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
things are all very important but there

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.550 
things are all very important but there
are<00:00:35.430> certain<00:00:35.820> receivers<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.260> just

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
are certain receivers that are just

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.580 
are certain receivers that are just
quarterback<00:00:38.130> friendly<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.230> what<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> mean<00:00:40.530> by

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
quarterback friendly and what I mean by

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.700 
quarterback friendly and what I mean by
that<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.780> when<00:00:42.780> they're<00:00:42.960> running<00:00:43.170> their<00:00:43.500> route

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that is when they're running their route

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.800 
that is when they're running their route
their<00:00:44.370> body<00:00:44.670> language<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.480> they're<00:00:45.630> running

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
their body language when they're running

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.470 
their body language when they're running
the<00:00:46.050> route<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.590> does<00:00:46.950> tell<00:00:47.310> you<00:00:47.640> when

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the route really does tell you when

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.940 
the route really does tell you when
they're<00:00:48.630> gonna<00:00:48.720> come<00:00:48.990> out<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.290> their<00:00:49.380> break<00:00:49.650> or

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they're gonna come out of their break or

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.430 
they're gonna come out of their break or
what<00:00:50.160> they're<00:00:50.310> going<00:00:50.490> to<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.810> without

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
what they're going to do and so without

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
what they're going to do and so without
even<00:00:52.920> having<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.220> communicate<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
even having to communicate with that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.720 
even having to communicate with that
particular<00:00:54.480> receiver<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.100> quarterback<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
particular receiver the quarterback and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
particular receiver the quarterback and
the<00:00:56.790> receiver<00:00:57.150> are<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> same<00:00:57.630> page<00:00:57.900> and<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the receiver are on the same page and I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
the receiver are on the same page and I
know<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.560> with<00:00:58.680> Michael<00:00:58.920> Urban<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.940> know

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
know that with Michael Urban you know

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700 
know that with Michael Urban you know
for<00:01:00.210> instance<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.720> would<00:01:00.810> have<00:01:00.960> an<00:01:01.079> 18<00:01:01.440> yard

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
for instance we would have an 18 yard

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
for instance we would have an 18 yard
comeback<00:01:02.190> route<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.760> he<00:01:03.060> may<00:01:03.210> cut<00:01:03.450> it<00:01:03.570> short

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
comeback route and he may cut it short

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
comeback route and he may cut it short
to<00:01:03.960> 15<00:01:04.379> yards<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.309> really<00:01:05.550> knew<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to 15 yards but no one really knew that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.110 
to 15 yards but no one really knew that
he<00:01:07.110> cut<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.440> short<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> could<00:01:08.490> tell<00:01:08.790> by

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
he cut it short because I could tell by

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.310 
he cut it short because I could tell by
the<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.690> running<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.020> route<00:01:10.290> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the way he was running that route that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
the way he was running that route that
he<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> come<00:01:11.190> out<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> break

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
he was going to come out of the break

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.180 
he was going to come out of the break
you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.540> sooner<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.229> he<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.950> should

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
you know sooner then he really should

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.860 
you know sooner then he really should
have<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.479> type<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
have and when you get that type of

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.800 
have and when you get that type of
rapport<00:01:16.760> with<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.790> receiver<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
rapport with a receiver it's it's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
rapport with a receiver it's it's
special<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.530> sometimes<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.340> happen<00:01:20.520> in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
special and sometimes that can happen in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.310 
special and sometimes that can happen in
a<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.120> short<00:01:21.330> period<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> mean

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a really short period of time I mean

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
a really short period of time I mean
Michael<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> obviously<00:01:23.909> played<00:01:24.150> together

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
Michael and I obviously played together

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
Michael and I obviously played together
for<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> long<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.260> but<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.190> very

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
for a long time but we had that very

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.700 
for a long time but we had that very
early<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:27.510> our<00:01:27.630> relationship<00:01:28.350> together

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
early in our relationship together

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
early in our relationship together
there's<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.549> receivers<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.450> stay

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there's some receivers they could stay

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.570 
there's some receivers they could stay
around<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.290> four<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.590> five<00:01:31.740> six<00:01:32.010> years<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
around for four or five six years and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.730 
around for four or five six years and
you<00:01:33.060> never<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.659> they're<00:01:33.810> going<00:01:34.440> to<00:01:34.530> do

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you never know what they're going to do

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
you never know what they're going to do
or<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> route<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.580> they're<00:01:35.850> running<00:01:36.420> if

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
or the route that they're running if

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.969 
or the route that they're running if
they're<00:01:36.810> running<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> proper<00:01:37.500> distance<00:01:37.830> or

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
they're running the proper distance or

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.370 
they're running the proper distance or
if<00:01:38.040> they're<00:01:38.159> coming<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.490> short<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:39.380> those

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
if they're coming out short and those

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
if they're coming out short and those
are<00:01:40.619> unique<00:01:41.100> situations<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.510> had<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
are unique situations and and I had it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.120 
are unique situations and and I had it
with<00:01:42.930> Michael<00:01:43.170> Urban<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.650> had<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:43.979> Jay

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
with Michael Urban I had it with Jay

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
with Michael Urban I had it with Jay
Novacek<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:45.479> if<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.780> around

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
Novacek and I think if you look around

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.750 
Novacek and I think if you look around
the<00:01:46.170> league<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.220> know<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
the league you know it's some of the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.910 
the league you know it's some of the
quarterback<00:01:48.299> receiver<00:01:48.900> combinations<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
quarterback receiver combinations I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.969 
quarterback receiver combinations I
think<00:01:50.070> Tom<00:01:50.340> Brady<00:01:50.670> Wes<00:01:50.939> Welker<00:01:51.210> comes<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> mind

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
think Tom Brady Wes Welker comes to mind

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.730 
think Tom Brady Wes Welker comes to mind
drew<00:01:53.490> Brees<00:01:53.700> Marcus<00:01:54.420> Colston<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
drew Brees Marcus Colston you know and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
drew Brees Marcus Colston you know and
there's<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.220> others<00:01:56.610> certainly<00:01:57.090> Peyton

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
there's there's others certainly Peyton

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
there's there's others certainly Peyton
Manning<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.140> Marvin<00:01:58.830> Harrison<00:01:59.250> over<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
Manning and Marvin Harrison over the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.770 
Manning and Marvin Harrison over the
years<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.880> there's<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.689> those

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
years so there's a lot of those

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
years so there's a lot of those
combinations<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> game

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
combinations that we see in the game

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.219 
combinations that we see in the game
today<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.689> big<00:02:03.869> reason<00:02:04.020> why

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
today and that's a big reason why

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.460 
today and that's a big reason why
they're<00:02:04.560> successful<00:02:04.830> as<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.430> are
