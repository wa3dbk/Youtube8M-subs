ingredients

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.900 

so<00:00:38.469> now<00:00:38.620> let's<00:00:38.890> start<00:00:38.980> by<00:00:39.340> cooking<00:00:39.579> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910

drop<00:01:17.020> into<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.410> oil<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.770> I'm<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.220> do

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
drop into the oil and I'm going to do

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.529 
drop into the oil and I'm going to do
the<00:01:18.610> same<00:01:18.820> thing<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.300> remaining

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
the same thing with the remaining

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
eggplants

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.130 
eggplants
this<00:01:20.979> way<00:01:21.250> they<00:01:21.490> don't<00:01:21.670> turn<00:01:21.910> dark<00:01:22.690> in<00:01:22.899> color

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
this way they don't turn dark in color

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.010 
this way they don't turn dark in color
otherwise<00:01:23.470> if<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.920> cut<00:01:24.220> them<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.780> keep<00:01:25.780> them

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
otherwise if you cut them and keep them

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.149 
otherwise if you cut them and keep them
aside<00:01:26.320> then<00:01:26.920> they<00:01:27.160> turn<00:01:27.460> brown<00:01:28.240> color<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:30.039> if

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
aside then they turn brown color so if

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.399 
aside then they turn brown color so if
you<00:01:30.250> want<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:31.210> this<00:01:31.450> ahead<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:31.929> time<00:01:32.050> you

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.250 
my onions so basically we are going to
cover<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:30.970> up<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:31.750> are<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:31.960> to<00:03:32.110> cook

until they're nice and tender

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.600 
until they're nice and tender
this<00:04:08.170> should<00:04:08.320> approximately<00:04:09.160> take<00:04:09.370> about

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
this should approximately take about

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.630 
this should approximately take about
five<00:04:10.330> minutes<00:04:10.360> so<00:04:10.920> I'm<00:04:11.920> just<00:04:12.130> going<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.370> cover

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
five minutes so I'm just going to cover

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.420 
five minutes so I'm just going to cover
and<00:04:12.880> cook<00:04:13.000> for<00:04:13.060> five<00:04:13.480> minutes<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:15.040> it's<00:04:15.220> been

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
and cook for five minutes so it's been

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.949 
and cook for five minutes so it's been
exactly<00:04:15.880> about<00:04:16.000> five<00:04:16.299> minutes<00:04:16.510> let's<00:04:16.840> check

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
exactly about five minutes let's check

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.009 
exactly about five minutes let's check
this<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.560> as<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.250> see<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:19.270> our<00:04:19.450> leaves<00:04:19.750> are

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
dilute it basically you have cleaned up

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.590 
dilute it basically you have cleaned up
grinder<00:05:11.890> jar<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.460> I'm<00:05:12.910> going<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.210> use<00:05:13.420> the

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
of water basically you can adjust this

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.200 
of water basically you can adjust this
consistency<00:05:20.490> depending<00:05:21.490> on<00:05:21.610> how<00:05:21.790> you<00:05:21.850> like

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
your gravy the atom down pick plants mix

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.810 
your gravy the atom down pick plants mix

minutes<00:05:33.490> on<00:05:33.790> a<00:05:33.910> low<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.480> medium<00:05:34.630> heat<00:05:34.990> so<00:05:35.830> that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
minutes on a low to medium heat so that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.040 
minutes on a low to medium heat so that
the<00:05:36.400> eggplants<00:05:36.940> absorb<00:05:37.330> all<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.660> flavors
