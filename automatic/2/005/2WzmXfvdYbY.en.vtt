00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
trapped to sunlight and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.140 
trapped to sunlight and
seals<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.010> kind<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.430> hot<00:02:04.670> car<00:02:04.940> on<00:02:05.090> a

summer day and that you know I've seen
my<00:02:08.539> solo<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.080> get<00:02:09.229> 350<00:02:09.679> 375<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:12.020> definitely

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
my solo up and get 350 375 it definitely

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.620 
my solo up and get 350 375 it definitely
does<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.650> job<00:02:12.920> cooking<00:02:13.190> food<00:02:13.610> he's<00:02:13.940> absolutely

does a job cooking food he's absolutely
no<00:02:14.990> electricity<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.940> I'm<00:02:17.030> basically

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
no electricity and so I'm basically

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
long-term food storage and a huge pinch

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.240 
long-term food storage and a huge pinch
if<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.820> no<00:02:23.000> power<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:24.260> know<00:02:24.380> water<00:02:24.800> you

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
if you have no power you know water you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.860 
if you have no power you know water you
you<00:02:25.520> know<00:02:25.640> well<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.390> say<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.690> can

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
you know well if I say you can

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.870 
you know well if I say you can
supplement<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.500> rainwater<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
supplement with rainwater that the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.870 
supplement with rainwater that the
turkey<00:02:29.330> bacon<00:02:29.800> I'm<00:02:30.800> substituting<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.790> know

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
turkey bacon I'm substituting you know

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.670 
turkey bacon I'm substituting you know
you<00:02:32.000> could<00:02:32.150> substitute<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.810> with<00:02:32.990> foul<00:02:33.290> and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
you could substitute that with foul and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.310 
you could substitute that with foul and
I'll<00:02:34.610> talk<00:02:34.850> later<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.240> about<00:02:35.360> how<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.170> could

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
I'll talk later on about how you could

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.470 
I'll talk later on about how you could
hunt<00:02:36.680> down<00:02:36.890> crows<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.670> little<00:02:38.000> finches<00:02:38.450> and

hunt down crows and little finches and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.670 
hunt down crows and little finches and
stuff<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.850> place<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.880> protein<00:02:41.680> but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
stuff like that in place of protein but

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.260 
stuff like that in place of protein but
that's<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.040> Taylor<00:02:43.400> separate<00:02:43.850> subject

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
that's a Taylor separate subject

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.300 
that's a Taylor separate subject

point you know I choose not to do that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.210 
point you know I choose not to do that
right<00:02:58.820> now<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.840> anyhow<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.190> put

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
right now so anyhow I'm going to go put

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.420 
right now so anyhow I'm going to go put
these<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.700> oven<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.209> about<00:03:02.480> 9<00:03:03.170> 15<00:03:03.830> right

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
these in the oven it's about 9 15 right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.720 
these in the oven it's about 9 15 right
now<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.930> oven<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:07.160> been<00:03:07.430> out<00:03:07.549> in<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
now and the oven it's been out in the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.880 
now and the oven it's been out in the
sunlight<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.989> probably<00:03:11.989> about<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.830> know

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
sunlight this is probably about you know

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.530 
sunlight this is probably about you know
Nick<00:03:13.190> Mary<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.760> or<00:03:14.000> not<00:03:14.180> quite<00:03:14.420> an<00:03:14.600> hour<00:03:14.709> and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
Nick Mary now or not quite an hour and

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.680 
Nick Mary now or not quite an hour and
the<00:03:17.540> oven<00:03:18.019> temperature<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.530> about<00:03:18.910> 240<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.239> so

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
the oven temperature is about 240 and so

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.789 
the oven temperature is about 240 and so
I'm<00:03:20.780> going<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.930> go<00:03:21.019> ahead<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.200> set<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:21.590> there

I'm going to go ahead and set out there

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.770 
I'm going to go ahead and set out there

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
a couple solar ovens you could easily do

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.870

some<00:05:40.600> cornbread<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.400> thought<00:05:42.610> saying

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
some cornbread and I thought saying

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.719 
some cornbread and I thought saying
before<00:05:43.000> if<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.389> had<00:05:43.570> any<00:05:44.050> fall<00:05:44.430> then<00:05:45.430> you

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
before if you had any fall then you

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.460 
before if you had any fall then you
could<00:05:45.880> substitute<00:05:46.300> that<00:05:46.780> for<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.020> Turk<00:05:47.260> yet

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
could substitute that for the Turk yet

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.100 
could substitute that for the Turk yet
put<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:47.740> there<00:05:47.860> that's<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.280> only<00:05:48.460> difference

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
put in there that's the only difference

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.229 
put in there that's the only difference
all<00:05:50.110> right
