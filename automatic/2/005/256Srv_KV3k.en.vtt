00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.540
 in without them the materials in the story about 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 economical engines which 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 only consumes 7 8 amps at 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 very large 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 newtons per meter per meter that is very 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.109
 great topic 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 well now in brief you just repeat 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.430
 this experiment and we wanted to combine 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.970
 and now we did it combine this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.540
 motor together with generator alternator 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.000
 which will be on the outside 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.890
 generate more energy well before 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 than 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 demonstrate motor compilation 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.930
 motor generator we will show you separately 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.460
 small pieces test the motor and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.329
 generator and then together in the same package 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 eating fixture means here applied 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 scheme with only three running 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.449
 with 10 years running time it is strong 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.409
 very economical motor it develops 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.409
 high torque 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.920
 my 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.000
 its like everybody reaches idle current 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 the course 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560
 what if 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.259
 please tell me 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.259
 city 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.320
 create a joint motor generator with 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.030
 the outside 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.360
 generator that will produce 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.259
 energy and support all the time the unit 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.679
 batteries from 24 volts to very 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.690
 big and a mirage well there 95 130 amps 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.610
 hours is a pretty powerful battery and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.180
 the generator keeps charging 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.110
 the battery allows you to shoot with these 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.239
 batteries constantly shoot on so 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.239
 called pure sine that is 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.640
 a converter that with 24 volts they 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.790
 Now in all stores of Novosibirsk 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 makes a wonderful device 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.209
 pure sine 24 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.380
 220 and you turn on the cottage at the exit 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.590
 this converter 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 and starts there a kilowatt sbu 4 there are 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.870
 appliances 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.190
 they are performed on both 4 amps by 6 by 8 and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.860
 even 12 amps 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.470
 their sizes are small and please 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.290
 you can in the country almost 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.870
 disconnect from everything and a gas and this 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.840
 electricity and use this 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.799
 motor generator that constantly 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.630
 boosts 24 volt unit 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.610
 batteries batteries serve in 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.120
 this mode since it is always on 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.829
 on the floor the charge is not deeply discharged 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.970
 will serve 8-10 years 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.940
 imagine 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.000
 trail you practically have this 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.890
 energy storage 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.110
 well, this is a separate of mine before 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.420
 demonstrate the generator we are 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.940
 Now combined in one case with 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.270
 motor previously demonstrated and 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.690
 now we will show you about this see how 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.930
 lovers we placed that is not very 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.790
 so you need to strain to that in the motor 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:57.629
 this easy movement 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:59.819
 include a good friend here passive 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.890
 great effort is not necessary mid inertness 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.750
 pretty good now we did 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:10.109
 performed this generator in one package 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:13.109
 with a motor and about Timokhin and now 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:16.440
 we run the motor generator which 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.099
 united inside a motor on the outside 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.259
 parts of the generator he's not that big 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:28.860
 the size was only there 340 350 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.199
 millimeters in diameter here I am he 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.050
 set by social somewhere 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.620
 there in the basement I don't know where it is convenient in 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.530
 closet 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.389
 but he is constantly practically working from 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.660
 batteries which when returning energy they 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.330
 all the time in after the changeover 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.330
 with 24 volts from these large batteries 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:57.300
 and through the instrument converter which 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.940
 make sings pure sine 220 volts from 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.340
 2 amps there up to 8 in my all these 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.590
 appliances and you can turn it on 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.500
 heaters stove and mass of lamps 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.500
 electric it burns it means he 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
 works 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.039
 in the autumn 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.910
 getting started 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.880
 powerful 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.170
 perfect 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:25.830
 in the country put a block of photo elemental 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:29.760
 this base which will be and it will be only 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.950
 8 10 meters there and a half meters he 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.810
 will constantly give extra 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:38.100
 recharge with this battery but it 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.139
 for insurance for insurance and this one 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.560
 here is the system she allows us of course 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.010
 at best this is our first sample first 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.650
 sample 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:50.160
 we will be much better here 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:53.340
 do not biphase 3 4 phase to 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.680
 he did not create such a resonating sound 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:00.540
 here we soften these fluctuations and 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.990
 naturally increase efficiency 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.780
 because now it's the first damn he 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.540
 In general, it is not a lump of normal 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.270
 we all improve it of course here 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:15.050
 this block is needed and we are on it now 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.050
 working
