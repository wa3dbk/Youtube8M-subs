that<00:01:58.079> these<00:01:58.229> plot<00:01:58.560> points<00:01:58.979> were<00:01:59.130> handled<00:01:59.610> all

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that these plot points were handled all

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.209 
that these plot points were handled all
that<00:01:59.790> well<00:02:00.299> particularly<00:02:01.049> considering<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that well particularly considering the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.850

whole reason the other children decide
to<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.220> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> win

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
outside of the main story felt slightly

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.920 
outside of the main story felt slightly
in<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> nerd<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.669> overshadowed<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.450> important

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
in a nerd and overshadowed the important

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.929 
in a nerd and overshadowed the important
part<00:02:43.139> of<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.349> film<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.859> that's<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.609> shame

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
part of the film and that's a shame

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.420 
part of the film and that's a shame
because<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.569> movies<00:02:45.900> heart<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.409> soul<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:47.159> in

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
the story of Victor and Sparky which is

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.589 
the story of Victor and Sparky which is
well<00:02:49.620> done<00:02:49.950> their<00:02:50.819> story<00:02:51.180> was<00:02:51.359> really

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
well done their story was really

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.449 
well done their story was really

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.159 
parts that were meant to be sad were
really<00:02:56.280> sad<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.939> the<00:02:57.030> two<00:02:57.180> characters<00:02:57.780> really

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
really sad and the two characters really

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.319 
really sad and the two characters really
likeable<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.400> really<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.939> thing<00:03:00.150> that

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
likeable it's really the thing that

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.149 
likeable it's really the thing that
keeps<00:03:00.569> this<00:03:00.750> movie<00:03:01.049> from<00:03:01.379> being<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:01.859> Tim

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
keeps this movie from being one of Tim

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.309 
keeps this movie from being one of Tim
Burton's<00:03:02.549> more<00:03:02.790> average<00:03:03.209> films<00:03:03.750> because<00:03:04.109> when

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
Burton's more average films because when

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.229 
Burton's more average films because when
these<00:03:04.530> characters<00:03:05.159> are<00:03:05.280> on-screen<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.969> feels

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
these characters are on-screen it feels

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.059 
these characters are on-screen it feels
more<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.019> his<00:03:07.049> stronger<00:03:07.620> movies

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
more like some of his stronger movies

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.490 
more like some of his stronger movies
it's<00:03:08.849> really<00:03:09.090> these<00:03:09.419> two<00:03:09.689> characters<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it's really these two characters that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.619 
it's really these two characters that
keep<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.889> invested<00:03:11.219> in<00:03:11.639> distract<00:03:12.150> from<00:03:12.359> some
