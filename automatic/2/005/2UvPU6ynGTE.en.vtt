00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.270 
this vehicle and we have to start from
basics<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.539> find<00:01:56.780> out<00:01:56.930> what<00:01:57.200> engine<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.039> in<00:01:58.189> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
basics we find out what engine is in the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.190 
basics we find out what engine is in the
vehicle<00:01:58.609> what<00:01:59.119> fuel<00:01:59.390> injection<00:01:59.780> system<00:02:00.079> is

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
vehicle what fuel injection system is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.980 
vehicle what fuel injection system is
used<00:02:00.409> on<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.210> then<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.329> start<00:02:02.600> with<00:02:02.780> taking

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
used on it then we start with taking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.410 
used on it then we start with taking
Silla<00:02:03.649> scope<00:02:03.920> readings<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.520> other

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
Silla scope readings and other

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.330 
Silla scope readings and other
measurements<00:02:05.990> on<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.170> vehicle<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.189> we

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
measurements on the vehicle so then we

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.249 
measurements on the vehicle so then we
can<00:02:07.520> work<00:02:07.729> out<00:02:07.939> which<00:02:08.240> time<00:02:08.539> be<00:02:08.750> our<00:02:08.840> hardware

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
can work out which time be our hardware

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.710 
can work out which time be our hardware
we're<00:02:09.530> going<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.830> use<00:02:10.210> this<00:02:11.210> time<00:02:11.450> be<00:02:11.630> our

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
we're going to use this time be our

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.300 
we're going to use this time be our
module<00:02:12.110> requires<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.680> signal<00:02:13.100> from<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
module requires a signal from the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.640 
module requires a signal from the
throttle<00:02:13.520> position<00:02:13.700> sensor<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:15.050> enables<00:02:15.560> us

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
throttle position sensor this enables us

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.530 
throttle position sensor this enables us
to<00:02:15.710> monitor<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> drivers<00:02:16.850> demands

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
to monitor the drivers demands

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.509 
to monitor the drivers demands
so<00:02:17.959> therefore<00:02:18.379> we<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.560> change<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.159> mapping

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
so therefore we can change the mapping

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.610 
so therefore we can change the mapping
in<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.670> module<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.599> bring<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.140> parent

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
in the module to bring in the parent

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.580 
in the module to bring in the parent
talk<00:02:21.890> at<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.489> much<00:02:22.760> lower<00:02:23.030> rpm<00:02:23.689> and<00:02:23.870> therefore

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
talk at a much lower rpm and therefore

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.890 
talk at a much lower rpm and therefore
help<00:02:24.799> reduce<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.519> turbo<00:02:25.909> lag<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
help reduce the turbo lag and make the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.160 
help reduce the turbo lag and make the
vehicle<00:02:27.079> much<00:02:27.620> more<00:02:27.829> drivable<00:02:29.079> depending<00:02:30.079> on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
vehicle much more drivable depending on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.319 
vehicle much more drivable depending on
your<00:02:30.290> fuel<00:02:30.560> system<00:02:31.030> installation<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.180> take

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
your fuel system installation can take

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.420 
your fuel system installation can take
anywhere<00:02:32.780> from<00:02:33.049> 15<00:02:33.500> minutes<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:34.099> hour<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:54.900 
anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and
a<00:02:34.489> half

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.450 

from<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.630> point<00:02:55.810> onwards<00:02:56.290> then<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.100> go<00:02:57.250> into

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
from that point onwards then we go into

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.060 
from that point onwards then we go into
the<00:02:58.060> vehicle<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.480> dyno<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.770> set<00:03:00.040> up

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
the vehicle on the dyno and we set up

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.700 
the vehicle on the dyno and we set up
and<00:03:00.370> design<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.970> map<00:03:01.270> that<00:03:01.660> best<00:03:02.380> suits<00:03:02.620> that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
and design the map that best suits that

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.130 
and design the map that best suits that
vehicle<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> Australian<00:03:03.730> conditions

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
