00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Salon for Nastya, too, the same as the number 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.309
 6 only under 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.170
 [music] 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.690
 under 125 song 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 125 to 30 marking loop long and for 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 so that the router when you shake is not 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.570
 jumped it turns out that he does not reach 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.810
 base to the next instead of having to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 make such islands 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:40.440
 supportive now show how he too 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 under the clamp is calculated imagine that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:52.550
 it is a door then it is made under 18 down below 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.539
 there are 18 and 16 which were all 18 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.350
 also here is the bearing rolls on metal 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 you can see well he should about 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.040
 the center of the bearing ride on metal 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.530
 if he rolls the corner or top 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 or lower necessary adjustment here I am 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 become a shaybochka put between 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.810
 bearing cut and here it is visible black 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.900
 i.e. passive should center 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 ride let me cut without 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:32.570
 clamps it on the soup son and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.570
 he has such a door leads 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.969
 [applause] 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.969
 [music] 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.950
 and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 [music] 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.870
 but 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.870
 [music] 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.229
 hinges palladium 125 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.080
 we insert all on corners respectively 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.280
 pruned and everything has become beautiful now 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.280
 loop and cut the box 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.739
 the template has a side stop in pretty 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.590
 large and therefore necessary under the boxes under 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.220
 put something under it 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.000
 rested 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.730
 either users that construct do 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.360
 so more is done here to 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.360
 it was more convenient to press 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.699
 [music] 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.240
 [applause] 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 [music] 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.740
 pay attention to what quality and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.740
 speed accordingly give them become 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:45.980
 we cut the beams as well and everything will be 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:51.860
 beautiful step number three 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.860
