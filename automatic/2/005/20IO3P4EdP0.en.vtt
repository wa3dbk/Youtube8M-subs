the horses and the goats and all that

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.850 
the horses and the goats and all that
stuff<00:01:58.970> so<00:02:00.340> what<00:02:01.340> they<00:02:01.670> said<00:02:02.000> Mike<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.740> was

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
stuff so what they said Mike that it was

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.370 
stuff so what they said Mike that it was
gonna<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.070> 14<00:02:04.460> acres<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.990> did<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.170> little

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
gonna be 14 acres and we did a little

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.900 
gonna be 14 acres and we did a little
homework<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.429> found<00:02:07.640> out<00:02:07.789> that

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
homework on that and we found out that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.230 
homework on that and we found out that
cars<00:02:08.210> land<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.780> twelve<00:02:09.020> acres<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:11.150> just

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
cars land is twelve acres so it's just

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.150 
cars land is twelve acres so it's just
gonna<00:02:11.390> be<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> little<00:02:11.690> bit<00:02:11.780> bigger<00:02:11.960> than<00:02:12.890> cars

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
gonna be a little bit bigger than cars

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250 
gonna be a little bit bigger than cars
like<00:02:13.340> an<00:02:13.850> acre<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.300> not<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.960> grand<00:02:15.170> scheme

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
like an acre is not in the grand scheme

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.510 
like an acre is not in the grand scheme
of<00:02:15.410> things<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:15.740> not<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.980> much<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.370> the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
of things it's not that much in the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.030 
of things it's not that much in the
terms<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.910> total<00:02:17.210> park<00:02:17.390> size<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:18.440> 14<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.920> those

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
terms of total park size so 14 of those

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.700 
terms of total park size so 14 of those
that's<00:02:19.730> that's<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> good-sized<00:02:20.540> land<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.530> it's

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
that's that's a good-sized land but it's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.200 
that's that's a good-sized land but it's
not<00:02:21.860> huge<00:02:22.580> by<00:02:22.820> any<00:02:23.000> stretch<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:24.470> town<00:02:24.970> plus<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
not huge by any stretch to town plus the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.790 
not huge by any stretch to town plus the
other<00:02:26.390> areas<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.260> they're<00:02:27.380> talking<00:02:27.500> about<00:02:27.650> I

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
other areas that they're talking about I

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.530 
other areas that they're talking about I
think<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.220> too<00:02:28.490> much<00:02:28.670> that's<00:02:28.880> more<00:02:29.090> than<00:02:29.210> 14

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
think is too much that's more than 14

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.400 
think is too much that's more than 14
acres<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:31.700> my<00:02:31.819> belief<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.020> town<00:02:33.230> is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
acres so it is my belief the to town is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.210 
acres so it is my belief the to town is
going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.710> be<00:02:33.860> spared<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.980> feels

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
going to be spared in this this feels

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.070 
going to be spared in this this feels
impossibly<00:02:37.700> quiet<00:02:37.970> right<00:02:38.120> here

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.399 

I'll<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.260> say<00:02:42.379> there's<00:02:42.560> no<00:02:42.650> trade<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.099> there

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
I'll just say there's no trade is there

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.410 
I'll just say there's no trade is there
there's<00:02:45.409> no<00:02:45.560> train<00:02:45.890> okay<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:47.090> was<00:02:47.209> really

but<00:05:45.460> there<00:05:45.580> certainly<00:05:45.820> wasn't<00:05:46.030> well<00:05:46.660> when<00:05:46.840> the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
but there certainly wasn't well when the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.330 
but there certainly wasn't well when the
Grand<00:05:47.110> Canyon<00:05:47.440> was<00:05:47.530> full<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.770> dinosaurs<00:05:48.190> is

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
Grand Canyon was full of dinosaurs is

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.160 
Grand Canyon was full of dinosaurs is
that<00:05:48.430> what<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:48.580> mean<00:05:48.700> yeah<00:05:49.060> okay<00:05:49.540> right<00:05:49.570> all

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
that what you mean yeah okay right all

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.110 
that what you mean yeah okay right all
right<00:05:50.260> so<00:05:50.470> that<00:05:51.070> didn't<00:05:51.310> happen<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.910> maybe

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
right so that didn't happen so maybe

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.700 
right so that didn't happen so maybe
we'll<00:05:52.300> be<00:05:52.360> able<00:05:52.420> to<00:05:52.540> get<00:05:52.630> a<00:05:52.660> pass<00:05:52.900> but<00:05:53.140> I<00:05:53.350> would

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
we'll be able to get a pass but I would

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.860 
we'll be able to get a pass but I would
say<00:05:53.920> that<00:05:54.190> this<00:05:54.730> I'm<00:05:55.030> guessing<00:05:55.480> this<00:05:55.570> would<00:05:55.720> be

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
say that this I'm guessing this would be

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.650 
say that this I'm guessing this would be
the<00:05:56.080> edge<00:05:56.260> of<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.830> land<00:05:57.040> okay<00:05:57.669> so<00:05:58.210> we're<00:05:58.570> not

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
the edge of the land okay so we're not

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.990 
the edge of the land okay so we're not
actually<00:05:58.840> gonna<00:05:59.140> be<00:05:59.320> present<00:05:59.950> this<00:06:00.669> is<00:06:00.850> gonna

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
actually gonna be present this is gonna

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.850 
actually gonna be present this is gonna
be<00:06:01.150> mostly<00:06:01.419> backdrop<00:06:01.990> right<00:06:02.410> mostly

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860

like that huge mountain they had in the
back<00:06:05.980> of<00:06:06.100> that<00:06:06.130> that<00:06:06.580> concept<00:06:06.970> art<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.660> they're

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
back of that that concept art so they're

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.970 
back of that that concept art so they're
gonna<00:06:07.930> there's<00:06:08.169> going<00:06:08.290> to<00:06:08.350> be<00:06:08.410> mountain<00:06:08.800> all

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
gonna there's going to be mountain all

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.770 
gonna there's going to be mountain all
right<00:06:09.190> here<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.669> then<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.300> land<00:06:10.540> will<00:06:10.690> be

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
right here and then the land will be

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.940 
right here and then the land will be
going<00:06:11.500> in<00:06:11.590> that<00:06:11.680> direction<00:06:12.150> yeah<00:06:13.410> now<00:06:14.410> what<00:06:14.890> do

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950

that's what it was called

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.010 
that's what it was called
okay<00:06:24.040> the<00:06:24.700> the<00:06:25.090> play-doh<00:06:25.270> stables<00:06:25.870> were<00:06:25.930> to

goats and Walt Disney's frozen head

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.840 
goats and Walt Disney's frozen head
they're<00:06:30.310> gonna<00:06:31.320> be<00:06:32.320> okay

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
they're gonna be okay

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.900 
they're gonna be okay
that's<00:06:34.720> gonna<00:06:34.930> get<00:06:35.140> moved<00:06:35.440> off<00:06:35.680> site<00:06:36.010> I<00:06:36.280> guess

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
that's gonna get moved off site I guess

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.460 
that's gonna get moved off site I guess
and<00:06:37.240> they're<00:06:37.720> gonna<00:06:37.840> they're<00:06:38.200> gonna<00:06:38.260> take

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
and they're gonna they're gonna take

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.770 
and they're gonna they're gonna take
over<00:06:38.590> that<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.130> my<00:06:39.400> thought<00:06:39.670> is<00:06:39.880> is<00:06:40.210> that

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
over that and my thought is is that

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.950 
over that and my thought is is that
that's<00:06:40.960> that's<00:06:41.170> about<00:06:42.570> well<00:06:43.570> then<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:43.900> I

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
that's that's about well then and I

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
that's that's about well then and I
think<00:06:44.020> a<00:06:44.170> little<00:06:44.260> bit<00:06:44.410> further<00:06:44.500> this<00:06:44.800> way

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
think a little bit further this way

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.650 
think a little bit further this way
because<00:06:45.160> this<00:06:45.310> actually<00:06:45.730> we're<00:06:45.880> really<00:06:46.000> close

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
because this actually we're really close

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.060 
because this actually we're really close
closer<00:06:47.110> than<00:06:47.230> you<00:06:47.350> think<00:06:47.410> right<00:06:47.860> now<00:06:48.010> to

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
closer than you think right now to

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.340 
closer than you think right now to
toontown<00:06:48.550> we're<00:06:49.060> really<00:06:49.330> close<00:06:49.600> it's<00:06:50.230> like

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
toontown we're really close it's like

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.800 
toontown we're really close it's like
right<00:06:50.770> over<00:06:50.800> there<00:06:51.270> so<00:06:52.270> we're<00:06:52.450> not<00:06:52.510> it's<00:06:52.690> not<00:06:52.750> a

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
right over there so we're not it's not a

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.360 
right over there so we're not it's not a
big<00:06:53.050> stretch<00:06:53.380> to<00:06:53.590> connect<00:06:53.890> and<00:06:54.070> that's<00:06:54.160> the

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
big stretch to connect and that's the

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.530 
big stretch to connect and that's the
idea<00:06:54.670> is<00:06:54.760> that<00:06:54.940> they're<00:06:55.060> going<00:06:55.150> to<00:06:55.210> connect

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
idea is that they're going to connect

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.320 
idea is that they're going to connect
critter<00:06:56.230> country<00:06:56.440> now<00:06:56.890> oh<00:06:57.130> wait<00:06:57.820> how<00:06:58.000> do<00:06:58.060> we<00:06:58.150> do

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
critter country now oh wait how do we do

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.440 
critter country now oh wait how do we do
that<00:06:59.460> because<00:07:00.460> that<00:07:00.610> was<00:07:00.880> they<00:07:01.000> were<00:07:01.030> talking

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
that because that was they were talking

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.300 
that because that was they were talking
about<00:07:01.510> connecting<00:07:02.020> it<00:07:02.140> in<00:07:02.260> the<00:07:02.650> mice<00:07:03.070> chat

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
about connecting it in the mice chat

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.340 
about connecting it in the mice chat
article<00:07:05.250> you<00:07:06.250> can't<00:07:06.990> unless<00:07:07.990> there's<00:07:08.200> more

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
article you can't unless there's more

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.010 
article you can't unless there's more
backstage<00:07:08.890> area<00:07:09.160> which<00:07:09.280> there<00:07:09.460> is<00:07:09.580> I<00:07:09.730> think

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
backstage area which there is I think

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.660 
backstage area which there is I think
but<00:07:11.020> that's<00:07:11.200> but<00:07:11.620> the<00:07:11.740> shape<00:07:12.010> of<00:07:12.160> it<00:07:12.310> that<00:07:12.520> the

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
but that's but the shape of it that the

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.360 
but that's but the shape of it that the
concept<00:07:13.150> art<00:07:13.800> didn't<00:07:14.800> lend<00:07:14.950> itself<00:07:15.190> to<00:07:15.340> that

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
concept art didn't lend itself to that

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.490 
concept art didn't lend itself to that
kind<00:07:15.640> of<00:07:15.700> shape<00:07:18.900> we've<00:07:19.900> got<00:07:20.080> lots<00:07:20.260> more<00:07:20.350> videos

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
kind of shape we've got lots more videos

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.320 
kind of shape we've got lots more videos
for<00:07:20.860> you<00:07:20.920> to<00:07:21.010> see<00:07:21.160> so<00:07:21.460> grab<00:07:21.760> a<00:07:21.790> chiral<00:07:22.210> and
