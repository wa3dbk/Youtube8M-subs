he is the largest in his Ultimo to
vehicle<00:00:44.329> mode<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.109> he<00:00:45.350> does<00:00:45.559> transform<00:00:46.100> as<00:00:46.370> a

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
vehicle mode but he does transform as a

let's<00:00:50.179> stop<00:00:50.390> yapping<00:00:50.929> here<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.440> get<00:00:51.620> right<00:00:51.859> to

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
let's stop yapping here and get right to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.009 
let's stop yapping here and get right to
transformation<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.539> first<00:00:53.750> thing<00:00:53.929> you

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
transformation so the first thing you

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.810 
transformation so the first thing you
want<00:00:54.199> to<00:00:54.230> do<00:00:54.410> flip<00:00:55.100> up<00:00:55.280> tail<00:00:55.730> fins<00:00:56.079> like<00:00:57.079> this

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
want to do flip up tail fins like this

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.380 
want to do flip up tail fins like this
take<00:00:58.820> your<00:00:59.030> wing<00:00:59.449> sections<00:00:59.989> up<00:01:01.149> rotate<00:01:02.149> them

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
take your wing sections up rotate them

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.689 
take your wing sections up rotate them
around<00:01:02.600> get<00:01:03.469> them<00:01:03.589> out<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.070> way<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:04.670> our

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
around get them out of the way for our

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.899 
around get them out of the way for our
later<00:01:05.180> transformation<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:07.520> could<00:01:07.759> be

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
later transformation and this could be

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.640 
later transformation and this could be
somewhat<00:01:08.420> tricky<00:01:08.450> sometimes<00:01:09.290> because

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
somewhat tricky sometimes because

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.190 
somewhat tricky sometimes because
everything<00:01:10.579> here<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.600> quite<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:11.960> tight<00:01:12.259> fit

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
everything here is a quite a tight fit

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:25.420 
everything here is a quite a tight fit
so<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:15.759> just<00:01:16.759> about<00:01:17.210> there<00:01:17.950> okay<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.250> same

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
so we just about there okay and the same

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.249 
so we just about there okay and the same
with<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.610> other<00:01:25.759> side<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.840> one<00:01:26.990> worked<00:01:27.170> a

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
with the other side that one worked a

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.020 
with the other side that one worked a
lot<00:01:27.350> more<00:01:27.530> easier<00:01:27.860> then<00:01:28.610> we<00:01:28.790> want<00:01:28.939> to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
lot more easier then we want to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.719 
lot more easier then we want to
transform<00:01:29.630> or<00:01:30.380> take<00:01:30.710> back<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.219> nose<00:01:31.430> cone

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
transform or take back the nose cone

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.530 
transform or take back the nose cone
section<00:01:32.299> just<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.229> out<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.500> way<00:01:33.590> for<00:01:33.649> now

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
section just get out of the way for now

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.940 
section just get out of the way for now
and<00:01:35.540> put<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:35.990> probably<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.439> little<00:01:36.680> like<00:01:36.950> there

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
and put it probably a little like there

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.499 
and put it probably a little like there
I'm<00:01:39.950> gonna<00:01:40.130> get<00:01:40.340> them<00:01:40.460> up<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:41.000> standing

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
I'm gonna get them up to a standing

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.389 
I'm gonna get them up to a standing
position<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:42.229> flip<00:01:42.409> them<00:01:42.560> over<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.979> I'm<00:01:43.250> just

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
position to flip them over and I'm just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.060 
position to flip them over and I'm just
gonna<00:01:43.520> raise<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.939> camera<00:01:44.240> for<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.479> guys<00:01:45.070> what

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you can see when you flip them over is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.480 
you can see when you flip them over is
pretty<00:01:47.899> much<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.200> his<00:01:48.439> robot<00:01:48.860> mode<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.369> like

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
pretty much in his robot mode just like

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.149 
pretty much in his robot mode just like
the<00:01:49.640> original<00:01:49.969> g1<00:01:50.180> toy<00:01:50.479> was<00:01:50.719> gonna<00:01:51.680> flip<00:01:52.009> out

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
the original g1 toy was gonna flip out

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.709 
the original g1 toy was gonna flip out
this<00:01:52.369> section<00:01:52.640> out<00:01:52.939> of<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.119> way<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.539> back

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
this section out of the way at the back

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.819 
this section out of the way at the back
we'll<00:01:54.079> get<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.320> out<00:01:54.409> of<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.590> way<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.740> little

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
we'll get it out of the way a little

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.849 
we'll get it out of the way a little
more<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:56.299> go

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
more there we go

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.590 
more there we go
flip<00:01:57.859> out<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.130> feet<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.640> didn't<00:01:59.060> change<00:01:59.299> much

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
flip out the feet I didn't change much

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.270 
flip out the feet I didn't change much
about<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.170> legs<00:02:00.380> except<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:00.859> they're<00:02:01.070> ball

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
about the legs except now they're ball

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.399 
about the legs except now they're ball
jointed<00:02:01.609> a<00:02:01.700> instead<00:02:01.939> of<00:02:02.000> T<00:02:02.270> jointed<00:02:02.719> compared

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
jointed a instead of T jointed compared

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.649 
jointed a instead of T jointed compared
to<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:03.560> old<00:02:03.740> model<00:02:03.890> pull<00:02:04.609> out<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.850> feet<00:02:05.090> they

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
to the old model pull out the feet they

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.789 
to the old model pull out the feet they
can<00:02:05.689> still<00:02:06.200> twist

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
can still twist

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.699 
can still twist
so<00:02:07.490> it's<00:02:07.670> helps<00:02:07.969> for<00:02:08.119> poseability<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.349> I'll

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
so it's helps for poseability and I'll

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
so it's helps for poseability and I'll
just<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.069> him<00:02:10.190> standing<00:02:10.640> leg<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.300> this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just get him standing leg of this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.509 
which I guess would be a micro baldly so
it's<00:04:00.340> gonna<00:04:00.430> be<00:04:00.580> big<00:04:01.239> if<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.570> make<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> may

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
it's gonna be big if I make it so may

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.400 
it's gonna be big if I make it so may

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
not be very detailed I may do it I may
