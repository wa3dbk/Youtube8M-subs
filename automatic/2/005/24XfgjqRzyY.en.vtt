00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
shampoo and so it's going to dilute the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.289 
shampoo and so it's going to dilute the
color<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> allow<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:40.340> color

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
color but it's going to allow the color

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.289

I'm just working this color into the
shampoo<00:03:28.480> mixture<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.430> then<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.940> just<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
shampoo mixture and then this is just a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:41.370 
shampoo mixture and then this is just a
nice<00:03:32.520> safe<00:03:33.520> way<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.690> blending<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.770> color<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
I'm going to pay attention to the ends

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.710 
I'm going to pay attention to the ends
where<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:43.990> hair<00:03:44.170> was<00:03:44.380> previously<00:03:45.130> colored

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.840 

and<00:03:52.720> then<00:03:53.020> make<00:03:53.260> sure<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.770> we<00:03:53.980> work<00:03:54.280> in<00:03:54.640> that

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
and then make sure that we work in that

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.640 
and then make sure that we work in that
here<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.840> has<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.620> been<00:03:56.770> lightened<00:03:57.420> and

here that has just been lightened and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.010 
here that has just been lightened and
then<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.860> will<00:04:00.070> just<00:04:00.130> process<00:04:00.880> for<00:04:01.210> 20

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
then this will just process for 20

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.100 
then this will just process for 20
minutes<00:04:02.470> 25<00:04:02.830> minutes<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:03.700> then<00:04:04.110> we'll
