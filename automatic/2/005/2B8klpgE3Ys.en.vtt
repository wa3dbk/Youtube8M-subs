00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.460
 well let's explain the operation of the alarm is pizzi mcconnel 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.500
 n percent good now the alarm as this one armed 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 well then we will be 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.560
 very well the byc the icons of it of the command have changed 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.609
 well then now 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.429
 we can leave it like that with in percent mode 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.730
 with sound I mean either 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.079
 now if you see the center icon of the volume avelina / that crosses it now 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.700
 is in silent mode 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.210
 which and if in case of a hundred the motorcycle alarm will go off 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 would indicate only by a hundred the command who are touching the bike and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 well the turn signals that would turn on but it would not sound 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.710
 it would not be the alarm 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 ok then it was we put it in sound mode 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.690
 that as you see in return to the icon again the bar is no longer 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 Well now we are going to give the contact 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.760
 c 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.780
 As you can see, the alarm has jumped 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 and now 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.910
 us one hundred percent in a few seconds will notify us is highly with three 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:23.980
 beeps 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.860
 that we have not set the alarm 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 so now we put it on 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.140
 and now 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.330
 let's check coe with a tap 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.250
 the alarm goes off 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.590
 tozzi is worth cerf him 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 6 percent in the month 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.050
 yes and let us know the command that we were touching the bike very well 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.710
 then one can only be missing 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.150
 we put it together 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.540
 The only thing that we need to check is the microwave sensor 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 party 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.270
 know yourself down there exactly with the yellow bull 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.870
 the only thing that I have with a level of sensitivity nor will it be 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 until you're on top of the bike and now one jumps 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.269
 because if you would not be three times going by the motorcycle that by people who pass 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.659
 by the side mentioned since then good 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.920
 then it has to be good for about 15 seconds 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.529
 detecting 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.529
 movement then it will be when I jumped 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:29.639
 Let's see 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.119
 more or less 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.329
 more or less order 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.119
 good view of the sensitivity level so low 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.929
 same is a little over two hours 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.740
 Of course, if there is not 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.740
 blows or anything on the motorcycle 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.499
 this we fix is ​​put more than anything in case you really are 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.499
 touching are mobbed by manipulating the bike something 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 once 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.049
 valdano will give you the anac 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:36.569
 cirlasa tazza 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.070
 6 if Charlie does not know how to be in charge 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.669
 if there are any soldiers 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.729
 lima dic lo del peri 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:45.639
 what 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.939
 its qualities we put together 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.939
 and now the afa we started 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.199
 then now we are going to 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.040
 for 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.969
 see option b 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.209
 disconnect with the command 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.289
 from here we reach him for the button above 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.359
 and the bike is paid for 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.819
 exactly 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.819
 then we come 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.360
 we put the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.479
 the flash I do not have the 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.930
 the option to start with the command because it does not know necessary is worth then 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.180
 now the bike is telling us 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.470
 that it's not that we've been using the bike we've stopped and we have not 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.470
 connected the alarm is ok then we connect it now 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.729
 but nothing is telling us first 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.830
 kitchen on that list first the motorcycle acoustically wolf we receive the signal 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.050
 in command 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.930
 ok then now we take the gun 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930
 and we have the bike 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:56.689
 well then 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:57.239
 a greeting
