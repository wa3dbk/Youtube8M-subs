extends<00:03:08.520> off<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.670> little<00:03:08.970> bit<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.480> got<00:03:09.630> a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
extends off a little bit it's got a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.260 
extends off a little bit it's got a
little<00:03:09.900> bit<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.170> flex<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.090> handle<00:03:12.090> the

little bit of flex in it handle the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.310 
little bit of flex in it handle the
torque<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> doesn't<00:03:14.850> vibrate<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.110> much

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
torque so it doesn't vibrate that much

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.660 
torque so it doesn't vibrate that much
when<00:03:16.980> you're<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:18.120> vibrates<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.570> lot<00:03:18.750> though<00:03:19.110> but

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
when you're it vibrates a lot though but

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.600 
when you're it vibrates a lot though but
it's<00:03:20.670> hard

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
it's hard

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.820 
it's hard
so<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:24.390> throttle<00:03:25.580> what<00:03:26.580> I<00:03:26.760> did<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.830> is

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
so the throttle what I did for that is

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.600 
so the throttle what I did for that is
the<00:03:29.100> cable<00:03:29.490> goes<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:32.210> there<00:03:33.210> okay<00:03:34.610> to

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
the cable goes from in there okay to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.160 
the cable goes from in there okay to
that<00:03:35.760> far<00:03:36.600> that's<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.080> here<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.970> cable<00:03:39.420> runs

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that far that's back here the cable runs

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.540 
that far that's back here the cable runs
all<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.440> way<00:03:40.680> over<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.810> now<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.170> is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
all the way over it here now this is

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.180 
all the way over it here now this is
there's<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.640> little<00:03:44.940> extension<00:03:45.450> spring<00:03:45.690> there

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
there's a little extension spring there

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.570 
there's a little extension spring there
sweet<00:03:47.480> petal<00:03:48.480> all<00:03:48.990> right

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
sweet petal all right

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.080 
sweet petal all right
so<00:03:50.580> going<00:03:50.880> back<00:03:54.800> it<00:03:55.800> doesn't<00:03:56.190> give<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.520> full

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
so going back it doesn't give it full

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.800 
so going back it doesn't give it full
throttle<00:03:58.760> but<00:03:59.760> it's<00:03:59.910> very<00:04:00.120> close<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.450> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
throttle but it's very close to it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.660 
throttle but it's very close to it
yourself<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:03.290> see<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> hand<00:04:04.620> thing<00:04:07.610> I'm<00:04:08.610> using

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670

inches<00:04:56.300> long<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:57.590> this<00:04:57.860> first<00:04:58.160> off<00:04:59.050> steel

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
inches long of this first off steel

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.410 
inches long of this first off steel
right<00:05:00.350> there<00:05:00.560> that's<00:05:01.250> 56<00:05:01.940> inches<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:04.150> it's<00:05:05.150> 10

inches<00:05:05.600> long<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.140> piece<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.860> white<00:05:07.010> steel

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
inches long that piece of white steel

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.850 
inches long that piece of white steel
and<00:05:09.430> it's<00:05:10.430> painted<00:05:11.420> black<00:05:11.920> so<00:05:12.920> it<00:05:13.340> won't<00:05:13.550> rust

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
and it's painted black so it won't rust

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.840 
and it's painted black so it won't rust
and<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:17.710> vibrates<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:19.130> whole<00:05:19.340> lot<00:05:19.550> but<00:05:19.730> it

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
and it vibrates a whole lot but it

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.710 
and it vibrates a whole lot but it
sounds<00:05:20.150> really<00:05:20.300> cool<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:20.990> exhaust<00:05:22.720> the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
sounds really cool that exhaust the

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.490 
sounds really cool that exhaust the
exhaust<00:05:24.110> makes<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.710> sound<00:05:24.970> deeper<00:05:26.470> into<00:05:27.470> a

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
exhaust makes it sound deeper into a

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.060 
exhaust makes it sound deeper into a
little<00:05:27.740> bit<00:05:27.950> louder<00:05:28.220> than<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.760> stock<00:05:29.180> exhaust

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
little bit louder than the stock exhaust

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:38.050 
little bit louder than the stock exhaust
and<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.610> gives<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:31.910> more<00:05:32.030> horsepower<00:05:32.540> so<00:05:35.050> it
