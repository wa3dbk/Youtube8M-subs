00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.700 

now<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.060> I'm<00:02:39.150> almost<00:02:39.300> done<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.470> say

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
time trying them out and there's
definitely<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.610> method<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.270> madness<00:02:51.330> if

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
definitely a method to this madness if

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.960 
definitely a method to this madness if
anybody<00:02:52.560> has<00:02:52.800> tried<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> coffee<00:02:53.490> farmers

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
anybody has tried the coffee farmers

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.260 
anybody has tried the coffee farmers
there<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.660> definitely<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.170> technique<00:02:56.000> but<00:02:57.000> I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
there is definitely a technique but I

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.480 
there is definitely a technique but I
figured<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.020> after<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.590> while<00:02:58.770> getting<00:02:59.190> used

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
figured that after a while getting used

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.390 
figured that after a while getting used
to<00:02:59.640> them<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.540> would<00:03:00.660> take<00:03:00.840> me<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.020> lot<00:03:01.260> less<00:03:02.160> time

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
to them it would take me a lot less time

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.790 
to them it would take me a lot less time
to<00:03:02.730> get<00:03:02.850> these<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.810> now<00:03:04.080> after<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.530> my

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
to get these in and now after all my

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.620 
to get these in and now after all my
dancing<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.460> prancing<00:03:05.640> showing<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.480> guys

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
basically wind what I had to figure out

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.810 
basically wind what I had to figure out
was<00:04:59.450> when<00:04:59.720> you<00:04:59.840> take<00:05:00.080> take<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.040> curls<00:05:01.370> apart

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
was when you take take the curls apart

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.460 
was when you take take the curls apart
like<00:05:01.940> separate<00:05:02.450> them<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.900> try<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.110> make<00:05:03.320> them

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
like separate them to try to make them

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.740 
like separate them to try to make them
more<00:05:03.560> volume<00:05:04.010> more<00:05:04.130> fullness<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:04.940> need<00:05:05.540> to

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
more volume more fullness you need to

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.560 
more volume more fullness you need to
turn<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.380> curl<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.340> way<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.730> was<00:05:08.000> turning

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
turn the curl the way it was turning

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.860 
turn the curl the way it was turning
inside<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.650> cuff<00:05:09.920> on<00:05:10.160> her<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:11.030> they<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.540> just

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
inside the cuff on her and they I just

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.330 
inside the cuff on her and they I just

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
added a little bit of little frizz

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.430 
added a little bit of little frizz
control<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.150> ends<00:05:14.450> of<00:05:14.540> my<00:05:14.570> hair<00:05:14.690> because<00:05:15.200> I

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
control to the ends of my hair because I

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.680 
control to the ends of my hair because I

think I should applied more gel or my

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:31.300 
think I should applied more gel or my
