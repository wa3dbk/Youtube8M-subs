so<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.589> taking<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.129> couple<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.700> rotten

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so we're taking a couple of rotten

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.909 
so we're taking a couple of rotten
boards<00:00:03.270> here<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:05.930> we're<00:00:06.930> painting<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
boards here and we're painting up the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.600 
boards here and we're painting up the
ends<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.900> water<00:00:09.900> repellent<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.370> case

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
ends with a water repellent in this case

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.999 
ends with a water repellent in this case
Thompson's<00:00:12.710> WaterSeal

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
Thompson's WaterSeal

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.670 
Thompson's WaterSeal
and<00:00:16.130> painting<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> tops<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> old

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and painting the tops of the the old

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.650 
and painting the tops of the the old
nail<00:00:20.010> holes<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.730> fill<00:00:21.000> those<00:00:21.180> old<00:00:21.449> nail

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
nail holes you can fill those old nail

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.410 
nail holes you can fill those old nail
holes<00:00:21.900> right<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.680> Thompson's<00:00:23.420> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
holes right up with this Thompson's and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.970 
holes right up with this Thompson's and
that<00:00:24.570> helps<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.410> usually<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that helps it out because usually the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
that helps it out because usually the
rot<00:00:26.160> starts<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> nail<00:00:27.060> holes<00:00:27.800> water

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
rot starts in the nail holes water

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.179 
rot starts in the nail holes water
collects<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:30.019> and<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> fill<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> up

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
collects in there and if you fill it up

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.770 
collects in there and if you fill it up
with<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.559> stops<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:35.480> rot<00:00:36.480> from

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
with something that stops the rot from

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170 
with something that stops the rot from
going<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.530> good<00:00:37.850> we've<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:38.910> this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
going in that's good we've got this

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.110 
going in that's good we've got this
little<00:00:39.420> piece<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.840> sheet<00:00:40.020> metal<00:00:40.230> damp<00:00:40.620> because

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
little piece of sheet metal damp because

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.369 
little piece of sheet metal damp because
there<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> little<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:44.930> decay<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.140> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
there was a little bit of decay on this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.400 
there was a little bit of decay on this
particular<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.510> we're<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.870> soaking

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
particular one and we're really soaking

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
particular one and we're really soaking
that<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> we're<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> put<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that one up and we're going to put the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
that one up and we're going to put the
sheet<00:00:50.969> metal<00:00:51.149> over<00:00:51.480> top<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
sheet metal over top of it so that it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.209 
sheet metal over top of it so that it
doesn't<00:00:54.920> continue<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> absorb<00:00:56.460> water<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
doesn't continue to absorb water and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.090 
doesn't continue to absorb water and
hopefully<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.579> get<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> few<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.590> few<00:01:01.590> years<00:01:01.890> out

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
hopefully we get a few a few years out

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.380 
hopefully we get a few a few years out
of<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:04.400> we're<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> also<00:01:05.760> probably

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of that and we're going to also probably

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.679 
of that and we're going to also probably
sister<00:01:06.930> something<00:01:07.200> alongside<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.130> one

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
sister something alongside of that one

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.130 
sister something alongside of that one
but<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.810> doesn't<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:11.060> help<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.330> sister<00:01:12.780> if

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
but it doesn't really help to sister if

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.090 
but it doesn't really help to sister if
you<00:01:14.479> allow<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> water<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.110> keep<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you allow the water to keep going in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.270 
you allow the water to keep going in
there<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> sheet<00:01:19.170> metal<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:20.100> piece

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
there so the sheet metal little piece

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
there so the sheet metal little piece
there<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.820> turn<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.840> flashing<00:01:22.170> for

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
there will turn out to be a flashing for

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.249 
there will turn out to be a flashing for
over<00:01:22.799> top<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
over top of that

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
over top of that
so<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> first<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so we're put we put the first one in

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.850 
so we're put we put the first one in
here<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.930> wanted<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> show<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
here but I just wanted to show you this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.700 
here but I just wanted to show you this
flashing<00:01:29.220> here<00:01:29.930> that'll<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.079> won't<00:01:31.439> allow

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
flashing here that'll look won't allow

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
flashing here that'll look won't allow
the<00:01:31.770> water<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> continue<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.329> accumulate

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the water to continue to accumulate

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
the water to continue to accumulate
underneath<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:37.290> we're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> cut

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
underneath that and we're going to cut

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
underneath that and we're going to cut
the<00:01:39.090> next<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> show

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the next one in but this is good to show

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.679 
the next one in but this is good to show
how<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.670> laughs<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.270> goes<00:01:42.450> right

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
how that laughs and that goes right

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
how that laughs and that goes right
underneath<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.920> see

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
underneath all of that so you can see

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.370 
underneath all of that so you can see
under<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.909> metal<00:01:50.909> will

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
under here and see with this metal will

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.840 
under here and see with this metal will
drip<00:01:52.380> off<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.390> edge

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
drip off that edge

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.050 
drip off that edge
any<00:01:56.320> more<00:01:57.320> water<00:01:57.800> into<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.250> would<00:01:58.670> here's

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
any more water into that would here's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.649 
any more water into that would here's
her<00:01:59.390> holy<00:01:59.630> sister<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:01.210> we<00:02:02.210> did<00:02:02.390> another

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
her holy sister this one we did another

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.520 
her holy sister this one we did another
sister<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:05.360> one<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.110> was<00:02:06.200> getting

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
sister that one because it was getting

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.460 
sister that one because it was getting
kind<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.860> weak<00:02:07.040> oh<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:09.380> worked<00:02:09.590> out<00:02:09.770> good

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
kind of weak oh it's all worked out good

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550 
kind of weak oh it's all worked out good
so<00:02:12.470> here's<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.010> deck<00:02:13.190> all<00:02:13.459> ready<00:02:13.730> for<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:14.560> few

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
so here's the deck all ready for a few

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.370 
so here's the deck all ready for a few
more<00:02:15.709> years<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:18.130> could<00:02:19.130> use<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> coat<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.820> paint

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
more years and could use a coat of paint

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.199 
more years and could use a coat of paint
and<00:02:21.380> this<00:02:21.740> particular<00:02:22.370> deck<00:02:22.610> had<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> lot<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
and this particular deck had a lot of

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.230 
and this particular deck had a lot of
dog<00:02:23.420> hair<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.750> between<00:02:23.990> them<00:02:24.910> that's<00:02:25.910> what

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
dog hair in between them that's what

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.060 
dog hair in between them that's what
holds<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.750> moisture<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> should<00:02:30.070> probably

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
holds the moisture so I should probably
