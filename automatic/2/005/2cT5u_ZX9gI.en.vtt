00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.170
 wh 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 Un'ii okay 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.750
 It is side 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.960
 Is that all ? 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.960
 Mountains and the sea 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.470
 And above 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.760
 It is the head 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.250
 It was a sudden eye 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.250
 I'm wondering if I'm sick of Tabnne 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 niko and 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.670
 It broke 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.300
 It could not be so much Birogu say little I Somehow today 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.129
 Not notice fatigue 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.839
 Well is Nechotto You know something here my head I'm an array 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.040
 Toga River Did Kke bet I'd have to place that say Kagawa here just last year to Birogu 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.280
 It's location was 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.210
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.800
 Pop pop 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.960
 Oh but even if it is done it is too early for one year 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.020
 I really wanted to be there last year but it was about a year ago 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.210
 No 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.799
 I can only say that birds reflect 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.670
 Well, if you do so with something like that, you'll be surprised that Kagawa is happy and Kagawa 's 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.700
 Cover things firmly 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 Because there is a child who lives around Kagawa surprisingly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.040
 8 maybe I'm fine the day after tomorrow the day after tomorrow 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 I'm afraid that today is a little bad weather 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.630
 Naa weather was good 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 Maybe tomorrow from about 6 o'clock still want 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.200
 30 minutes floor 6 hours 6 hours to 7 hours around 1 hour 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.230
 Perhaps 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.900
 When Maybe'm probably because there is a risk that is roughly maybe a walk in the Kagawa 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.470
 It's a part if you are here 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.570
 In the same way as me 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 For example, if I would like to take a walk and see if there is something para para existence 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.830
 At the end that by all means, please that voice plexes with it was another one last sound a little 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.740

 It is Twitter of those days It is 8 twitter, there is the present or the present, or the equivalent of that 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.330
