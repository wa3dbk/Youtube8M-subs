00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello to all welcome his course of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.980
 guitar 76 today we find ourselves 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 for a new video we will see 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 together how to transpose the range 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 major so we will change the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.960
 tonality of this range until then 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.279
 had finally seen him lighthouse major guy 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.320
 today we have here bordeaux to guys 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.769
 back major to further simplify a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
 little more equal major 7 chebaa va 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 deliver in the same order but to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 different parts of the handle in part 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.090
 to a true that both the seven scheme 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 dalian major two women to pass 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.710
 quite quickly part 2 the principle I 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.120
 will show you how to transpose 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 this moment of the cases the scheme number one 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 party three years is not afraid of the seven 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.230
 at marc second shifted and we'll have the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 even major backs are our site 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.410
 internet you can find all that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 in small pdf files in the section 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 downloads go on we attack the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 part to a re cap on the scenes 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 schema it's a return it's to learn 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.070
 the diagram with their number so the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:14.460
 number one infamous 13.35 of 3.5 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.960
 326 35 if this number by number 2 3 5 6 3 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.340
 5 7 5 6 3 5 7 5 6 8 6 Following this makes 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 many numbers the number 3 5 6 8 5 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.190
 inches 7 8 5 sets still 5 7 9 5 6 8 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 and 6 out of 10 for the last two 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:46.890
 records number 4 6 6 7 7 10 still 7 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 9 10 8 11 and the last string 8 10 from where 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:57.720
 that's the number 4 the number 5 8 10 12 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.650
 8 19 10 seconds 9 just 12 10 11 13 10 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.440
 12 13 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.550
 that's the number 5 the duo 6 nice 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:10.630
 news13 more 10 12 13 11 10 12 14 10 12 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.600
 14 11 13 15 and the last one 12 13 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.680
 15 the last forgiveness scheme is at 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.440
 number 7 11 13 15 13 cases during this 14 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.830
 May 11 12 14 of tostan 13 15 17 and 13 15 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.690
 17 for the last body the number 7 I 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.490
 think you remember it can 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.370
 also the case of the early inning 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.520
 with the strings ali so there is no serves 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 diagram all well aligned as it should 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.260
 Part 2 I show you the principle 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.820
 in fact to transpose the guy we're going 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 change the place where we do the shebab 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.340
 so we'll take the number one on 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.959
 number one diagram on the trade because 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.240
 points 3/5 we will consider it as 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.830
 at marc fathers why because the 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.420
 first gives here it's the tonic in 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.400
 does it's a fundamental it 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.260
 start here at my house starts with a 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.090
 fan one has in major range two women 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.709
 Fundamental there are everywhere 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.420
 on the handle and especially the diagrams 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.950
 but it's more practical to come back 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.890
 that he is good there good score of a body of 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.720
 migrants cazin finally 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.890
 so we will have fun shifting this pattern 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.590
 for today we want to do it in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.060
 back so I'm shifted this scheme back 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.069
 so I have to find a back on the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.549
 first rope got hold of ice 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.390
 of water I have a gift or six occasions 8 on 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.400
 the first rope 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.310
 so I'm going to shift my number 1 pattern 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.379
 in 8 instead of doing a 3 5 1 1 3 5 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.650
 well I'll start in life so 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:37.819
 I made 8 10 12 first strings 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.050
 second body like 8 10 12 underneath 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.110
 9 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.110
 10 so below the same 9 10 12 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.280
 the penultimate 10 12 13 and the small 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.280
 last one like all say very 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.870
 the way will die in millions 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 euros since we started in 8 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.520
 did not sing of a Catholic fundamental 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.170
 further but it's in 8 so in fact 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.510
 the principle is exactly that it is 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.010
 that we're going to have fun transposing we're going 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.640
 consider the seven patterns as 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.680
 wagons of a train 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.760
 the number one is the loco and the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.300
 valleys are still in the Moors 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.180
 so in the back the loco the number one I 6 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.790
 years 8 so we will have schema 1 here 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.710
 number 2 6 miles to 3 numbers 4 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.960
 after the war by number 5 numbers 6 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.150
 numbers 7 and after that it's your parts 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.830
 so we have already shifted the number 1 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.180
 now we will have fun with the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.320
 armpit I make you number one 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.320
 so we are good as it should 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.940
 wait for the TV number 2 which is 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.860
 always in members like 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.729
 so usually we did 8 10 12 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.960
 the number 2 or to do 10 12 13 years 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.630
 12-13 first record 10 12 14 2nd 10 2 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.949
 14th more 10 12 14 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.949
 the 4th 12 13 15 the front behind the 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.750
 little last by 12 13 this is the 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.310
 number 2 number 3 is a bit far 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.990
 but we can cannet at the beginning of 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:11.169
 sleeve so number 3 in doubt 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:14.940
 12 13 15 12 14 15 12 14 15 12 14 16 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.470
 this time the last two 13 15 17 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.389
 16 because 17 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.900
 these numbers 3 cuil bus trucks the 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.470
 saturn sleeve or watch 0 1 3 0 2 3 0 2 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.840
 3 024-1 300-1 35 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.960
 the first three diagrams the fourth 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:40.000
 it will start in gas 1 1 3 5 2 3 5 2 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:42.729
 320 ropes of 4.5 this time the front 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.300
 last to 3 5 6 the last one who 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.550
 pass five sets that's the fourth 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.880
 at ba the fifth it starts in 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:58.870
 three games five sets 3,500 bars to 5,7 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:02.530
 4 5 7 5 6 8 and 5 August 7 the sixth 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:11.560
 diagram how to get there number 5 5 7 8 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:13.630
 5 7 8 500 2 5 7 9 6 8 10 and it's neither 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.330
 more than the last is missing more 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.110
 that at home by number 7 that starts 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.150
 in box 7 7 then 10 or at the first 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:27.470
 rope 7 then 10 also for the 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:30.860
 second next 7 10 7 9/10 again 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.810
 the last two weeks me 12,8 more 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.880
 fresh 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.910
 the number 7 diagram the number one is in eight 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.889
 number numbers 3 in a low voice that 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.560
 number 4 million simple thanks steam a 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.700
 recipe we did it for the back but that 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.960
 walk for all the tones must 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.700
 to practice doing that we start 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.410
 by the back after having fun doing 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.270
 other tones if I want to do it 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.440
 so I take my number one scheme 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.550
 robert i'm going stalled in soil yes woman 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.980
 alone on the first string in box 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:00.600
 three games calmly at manu and will have 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.919
 in three 3 5 7 3 6 1 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.320
 once I have my pattern number 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.840
 I hold and sheva the wagons of the train 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.490
 always in my dead here you have 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.650
 all the tools so to transpose 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.600
 this range to major we will put you 2 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.669
 baqim playback tracking in tone of 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.139
 back and then after so in weeks 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.479
 who will come we will get you full 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.040
 of different tone to have fun and 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.560
 to work a little this major range 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.639
 that's all for today we are 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.350
 found for the next videos 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:29.520
 guitar lessons 76 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.520
 go hi hello
