00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
you're going to see is a brick of forest

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.280 
you're going to see is a brick of forest
moss<00:00:05.790> from<00:00:06.240> exo<00:00:06.750> Terra

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
moss from exo Terra

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.160 
moss from exo Terra
it<00:00:08.160> actually<00:00:08.550> comes<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:09.000> two<00:00:09.120> pieces<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:10.110> is

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
it actually comes in two pieces this is

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.290 
it actually comes in two pieces this is
just<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.309> bricks<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.639> comes<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
just one of the bricks that comes in the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.060 
just one of the bricks that comes in the
package<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:14.179> according<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:16.109> label<00:00:16.379> it's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
package and according to the label it's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.960 
package and according to the label it's
collected<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.090> forests<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.170> Asia<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.699> not

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
collected in forests in Asia it's not

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.120 
collected in forests in Asia it's not
the<00:00:21.180> same<00:00:21.420> stuff<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.500> from<00:00:22.949> New

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the same stuff that you get from New

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640 
the same stuff that you get from New
Zealand<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.359> not<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> same<00:00:25.019> stuff<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.380> we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
Zealand it's not the same stuff that we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.580 
Zealand it's not the same stuff that we
collect<00:00:26.039> here<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> United<00:00:26.880> States<00:00:27.439> but<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
collect here in the United States but it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.279 
collect here in the United States but it
comes<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.070> different<00:00:29.460> format<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
comes in a different format in this

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.440 
comes in a different format in this
compressed<00:00:31.859> brick<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.059> think<00:00:33.300> you'll<00:00:33.420> find

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
compressed brick and I think you'll find

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
compressed brick and I think you'll find
it<00:00:33.809> interesting<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.440> watch<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.860> expand<00:00:35.480> when

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it interesting to watch this expand when

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.459 
it interesting to watch this expand when
I<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.140> I'll<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.960> sped-up<00:00:39.960> mode

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I do this I'll do it in a sped-up mode

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.549 
I do this I'll do it in a sped-up mode
so<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.070> won't<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.520> long

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.400 

now<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> said<00:00:47.600> there's<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.899> bricks<00:00:49.200> in

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
now like I said there's two bricks in

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.080 
now like I said there's two bricks in
each<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:49.829> package<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.789> just

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
each one of these package this is just

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.910 
each one of these package this is just
one<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> them<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.750> already<00:00:52.230> expanded<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one of them I've already expanded the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.420 
one of them I've already expanded the
other<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:55.079> says<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> instructions

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
other one it says on the instructions

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
other one it says on the instructions
that<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.120> seven<00:00:57.660> quarts<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.260> its

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that it will make seven quarts in its

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680 
that it will make seven quarts in its
fully<00:00:58.770> expanded<00:00:59.280> form<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.820> didn't<00:01:00.539> actually

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
fully expanded form I didn't actually

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
fully expanded form I didn't actually
measure<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> last<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.879> sure

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
measure the last one I'm not so sure

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
measure the last one I'm not so sure
that<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.449> made<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> full<00:01:03.930> 7<00:01:04.320> quarts<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that it made a full 7 quarts and the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
that it made a full 7 quarts and the
instructions<00:01:06.119> call<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.979> liter<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.369> water

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
instructions call for one liter of water

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
instructions call for one liter of water
I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.540> I've<00:01:09.869> probably<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.560> liters<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
I think I've probably got two liters of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
I think I've probably got two liters of
water<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.659> sure<00:01:12.689> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
water in there just to make sure and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
water in there just to make sure and
during<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> process<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.850> may<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
during the process I may have to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
during the process I may have to
compress<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.770> tends<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
compress it down because it tends to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
compress it down because it tends to
have<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.460> dry<00:01:17.670> spots<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> top<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> got

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
have some dry spots on the top so we got

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.130 
have some dry spots on the top so we got
the<00:01:23.100> water<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.880> plastic<00:01:24.869> container<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
the water in this plastic container I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.719 
the water in this plastic container I
put<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> brick<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.340> let<00:01:29.579> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
put the brick in you can just let it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
put the brick in you can just let it
float<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.590> sure<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
float but I like to make sure that it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.410 
float but I like to make sure that it
goes<00:01:32.369> underneath<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.390> water<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:36.119> gets

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
goes underneath the water so it gets

00:01:36.420 --> 00:02:06.630 
goes underneath the water so it gets
soaked<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> top<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.560> well

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.880 

alright<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.790> was<00:02:07.820> 12<00:02:08.210> minutes<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.649> seems

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
alright that was 12 minutes and it seems

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.270 
alright that was 12 minutes and it seems
to<00:02:10.039> get<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.399> spot<00:02:10.910> here<00:02:11.210> where<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> doesn't

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
to get to a spot here where it doesn't

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.440 
to get to a spot here where it doesn't
suction<00:02:13.280> up<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.900> water<00:02:15.140> as<00:02:15.380> well<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.300> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
suction up the water as well and as you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.780 
suction up the water as well and as you
can<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> bottom<00:02:18.320> is<00:02:18.730> really<00:02:19.730> dripping<00:02:21.790> so

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
can see the bottom is really dripping so

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.440 
can see the bottom is really dripping so
I'm<00:02:22.910> turning<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.450> over<00:02:23.600> put<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> dry<00:02:24.920> area<00:02:25.450> on

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
I'm turning it over put the dry area on

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.830 
I'm turning it over put the dry area on
the<00:02:26.660> bottom<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:30.340> see<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.840> accelerates

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the bottom and see if that accelerates

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.759 
the bottom and see if that accelerates
it<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.230> rest<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> way

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.140 

okay<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.950> was<00:02:43.069> five<00:02:43.310> more<00:02:43.580> minutes<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.000> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
okay that was five more minutes and it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.910 
okay that was five more minutes and it
really<00:02:44.330> didn't<00:02:44.599> expand<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.290> whole<00:02:45.500> lot<00:02:45.680> more

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
really didn't expand a whole lot more

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:55.350 
really didn't expand a whole lot more
I'm<00:02:46.909> just<00:02:47.120> going<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:47.390> tip<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.689> on<00:02:47.780> its<00:02:47.840> side

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.450 

and<00:02:55.870> see<00:02:56.050> if<00:02:56.170> it'll<00:02:56.290> soak<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:56.920> some<00:02:57.190> more<00:02:57.370> of

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
and see if it'll soak up some more of

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.730 
and see if it'll soak up some more of
the<00:02:57.520> water<00:02:57.780> expand<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.990> little<00:02:59.110> bit<00:02:59.230> more<00:02:59.350> then

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
the water expand a little bit more then

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.580 
the water expand a little bit more then
I'll<00:02:59.830> flip<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.310> other<00:03:00.490> side<00:03:00.760> again

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.559 

okay<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.459> was<00:03:06.550> two<00:03:06.730> more<00:03:06.910> minutes<00:03:07.300> on<00:03:07.420> that

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
okay that was two more minutes on that

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.380 
okay that was two more minutes on that
side<00:03:08.040> I'll<00:03:09.040> flip<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.580> more<00:03:09.760> time

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
side I'll flip it one more time

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.550 
side I'll flip it one more time
to<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> other<00:03:11.620> side<00:03:13.080> falling<00:03:14.080> all<00:03:14.200> hard

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
to the other side falling all hard

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.000 
to the other side falling all hard
obviously<00:03:14.770> because<00:03:15.400> it's<00:03:15.489> pretty<00:03:15.610> wet<00:03:20.010> lost

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
obviously because it's pretty wet lost

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.809 
obviously because it's pretty wet lost
all<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.370> its<00:03:21.640> square<00:03:22.180> shape<00:03:22.540> as<00:03:22.750> well

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.399 

well<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.569> was<00:03:29.689> another<00:03:29.900> two<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.290> half

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
well that was another two and a half

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.649 
well that was another two and a half
minutes<00:03:30.799> there<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.069> as<00:03:31.159> you<00:03:31.280> can<00:03:31.430> see<00:03:31.670> the

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
minutes there and as you can see the

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.209 
minutes there and as you can see the
instructions<00:03:33.079> must<00:03:33.590> be<00:03:33.739> pretty<00:03:33.980> accurate

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
instructions must be pretty accurate

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.050 
instructions must be pretty accurate
because<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.939> did<00:03:35.450> not<00:03:35.629> absorb<00:03:36.049> all<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.620> water

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
because it did not absorb all the water

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.569 
because it did not absorb all the water
they<00:03:38.060> suggest<00:03:38.599> one<00:03:38.840> liter<00:03:39.109> I<00:03:39.439> put<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.099> perhaps

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
they suggest one liter I put in perhaps

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.530 
they suggest one liter I put in perhaps
two<00:03:40.939> so<00:03:41.810> about<00:03:42.019> two<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.469> half<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:43.420> what<00:03:44.420> it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
two so about two and a half is what it

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.589 
two so about two and a half is what it
actually<00:03:44.930> absorbs<00:03:45.939> no<00:03:46.939> big<00:03:47.150> deal<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.540> have

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
actually absorbs no big deal to have

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.390 
actually absorbs no big deal to have
more<00:03:47.900> water<00:03:48.260> I<00:03:48.409> think<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.829> speeds<00:03:49.099> up<00:03:49.250> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
more water I think that speeds up the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.190 
more water I think that speeds up the
process<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:50.810> pour<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.109> away

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
process and then you just pour it away

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.759 
process and then you just pour it away
anyways<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.790> at<00:03:52.909> this<00:03:53.060> point<00:03:53.329> what<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.079> do<00:03:54.230> is

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
anyways but at this point what I do is

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:05.770 
anyways but at this point what I do is
then<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.730> just<00:03:56.480> take<00:03:56.689> it<00:03:56.720> out

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.470 

and<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.440> start<00:04:06.740> to<00:04:06.830> just<00:04:07.160> fluff<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.240> like

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
and you start to just fluff it up like

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.980 
and you start to just fluff it up like
this<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.790> that's<00:04:11.630> where<00:04:12.140> you<00:04:12.260> come<00:04:12.470> up<00:04:12.680> with

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
this and that's where you come up with

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.910 
this and that's where you come up with
the<00:04:14.990> seven<00:04:15.440> quarts<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:18.220> finished<00:04:19.220> volume<00:04:20.920> if

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
the seven quarts of finished volume if

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.440 
the seven quarts of finished volume if
you<00:04:22.100> were<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.340> put<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.640> in<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.910> five-gallon

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
you were to put it in a five-gallon

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.300 
you were to put it in a five-gallon
bucket<00:04:23.480> that<00:04:24.020> was<00:04:24.170> filled<00:04:24.620> with<00:04:24.830> water<00:04:25.160> and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
bucket that was filled with water and

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.080 
bucket that was filled with water and
just<00:04:26.560> speed<00:04:27.560> up<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> process<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.850> would<00:04:28.970> work

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
just speed up the process it would work

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.160 
just speed up the process it would work
just<00:04:29.150> as<00:04:29.570> fine<00:04:29.710> but<00:04:30.710> what<00:04:30.920> I<00:04:30.950> would<00:04:31.100> suggest<00:04:31.520> is

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
just as fine but what I would suggest is

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.720 
just as fine but what I would suggest is
if<00:04:33.170> it's<00:04:33.380> waterlogged<00:04:33.950> after<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:34.400> don't

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
if it's waterlogged after that don't

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.840 
if it's waterlogged after that don't
squeeze<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.600> out<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.750> compress<00:04:36.230> it<00:04:36.850> because

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
squeeze it out and compress it because

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.960 
squeeze it out and compress it because
this<00:04:38.060> stuff<00:04:38.350> comes<00:04:39.350> with<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:40.130> little<00:04:40.700> bit<00:04:40.940> of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
this stuff comes with a little bit of

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.290 
this stuff comes with a little bit of
soil<00:04:41.510> on<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.110> bottom<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.210> when<00:04:44.210> you

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
soil on the bottom of it and when you

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.700 
soil on the bottom of it and when you
compress<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.310> soil<00:04:47.320> like<00:04:48.320> mud

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
compress it it is that soil like mud

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.270 
compress it it is that soil like mud
through<00:04:49.100> all<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.460> Greens<00:04:49.760> parts<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.720> moss

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
through all the Greens parts of the moss

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.800 
through all the Greens parts of the moss
so<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:52.310> would<00:04:52.520> suggest<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.180> just<00:04:53.510> fluff

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
so I would suggest that you just fluff

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.310 
so I would suggest that you just fluff
it<00:04:53.990> up<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:55.600> then<00:04:56.600> spread<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.200> out

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
it up like this and then spread it out

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.350 
it up like this and then spread it out
and<00:04:57.710> use<00:04:57.890> it<00:04:57.919> wherever<00:04:58.550> you're<00:04:58.910> going<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.150> use

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and use it wherever you're going to use

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.090 
and use it wherever you're going to use
it<00:05:01.480> there's<00:05:02.480> one<00:05:02.690> other<00:05:02.870> reason<00:05:03.350> that<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.950> do

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
it there's one other reason that you do

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.870 
it there's one other reason that you do
not<00:05:04.280> want<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:05.320> soak<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.590> in<00:05:06.650> water<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.340> then

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
not want to soak this in water and then

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.620 
not want to soak this in water and then
squeeze<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.330> out<00:05:09.550> not<00:05:10.550> only<00:05:10.850> does<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.030> disperse

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
squeeze it out not only does it disperse

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.530 
squeeze it out not only does it disperse
the<00:05:11.960> soil<00:05:12.290> in<00:05:12.590> through<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.100> green<00:05:13.340> leaves<00:05:13.669> of

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
the soil in through the green leaves of

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.800 
the soil in through the green leaves of
the<00:05:14.780> moss<00:05:15.040> but<00:05:16.040> also<00:05:16.250> when<00:05:16.640> you<00:05:16.820> compress<00:05:17.570> it

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
the moss but also when you compress it

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.170 
the moss but also when you compress it
like<00:05:17.960> this<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.380> squeeze<00:05:18.650> out<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:18.860> water<00:05:19.180> it

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
like this to squeeze out the water it

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.480 
like this to squeeze out the water it
never<00:05:20.479> again<00:05:20.990> quite<00:05:21.850> regains<00:05:22.850> its<00:05:23.210> original

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
never again quite regains its original

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.760 
never again quite regains its original
consistency<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:26.690> you'll<00:05:26.870> have<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.140> more<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.680> a

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
consistency and you'll have a more of a

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.830 
consistency and you'll have a more of a
matted<00:05:28.280> moss<00:05:28.520> than<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.800> fluffy<00:05:31.570> green<00:05:32.570> moss

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
matted moss than this fluffy green moss
