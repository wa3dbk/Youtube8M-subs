00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
minecraft bucket development is a little

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
minecraft bucket development is a little
bit<00:01:00.150> slower<00:01:00.540> than<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.320> minecraft

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
bit slower than the minecraft

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.789 
bit slower than the minecraft
development<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.540> either<00:01:03.780> download<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
development so you can either download a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.360 
development so you can either download a
beta<00:01:05.280> build<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.750> regular<00:01:07.320> version<00:01:07.799> there

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
beta build or a regular version there

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.420 
beta build or a regular version there
tends<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> bugs<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.680> development

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
tends to be a lot of bugs in development

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.680 
tends to be a lot of bugs in development
but<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> live<00:01:12.630> with
