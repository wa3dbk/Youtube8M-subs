00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.710
 so that today we will have a 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.360
 burgers we're going to also have some 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.790
 chicks wrapped and let's go also 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.519
 short flavored chicken monkeys 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.809
 we change the name of the little heart of 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.000
 chicken that also then they like 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.920
 quite this is already quite economical 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.780
 and it's good to be able to do it is not 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.280
 it seems we are always by the aggregate 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.660
 ibeas some guaraní burgers 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.580
 obviously, I'm going to place 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.380
 after a topping as an aggregate by 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.280
 over in this case we have to take and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.750
 chicken meat 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.490
 I'm going to make chicken , I also think that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.930
 is going to be a meat for the accident 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.030
 that you are already making your orders and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.999
 let's do like a sautéed one that's going to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.039
 go over the hamburger and that sauteed 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.059
 what he is going to do is give you much more 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:47.780
 flavor and consistency 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:50.629
 well I have six pips of bacon and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.239
 that are already cooked and are being released 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.039
 his fat what I did here was chop 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.679
 just bacon and place direct 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.969
 without putting oil on it and then not 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.179
 I put salt oil and look what's going to 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.979
 enter here half a half purple onion and 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.320
 half white onion cut and in 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.640
 Julian then this is going to be 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.450
 quite interesting because it's going to be 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.219
 how to use 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.990
 that was going to gratin with cheese 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.649
 mozzarella with which these are given 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.179
 imagine how rich is enough 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.070
 the ingredients are very rich to me what 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.770
 what I like is to mix the two types of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.179
 onion because it is much richer 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.539
 to achieve a bit of purple onion 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.939
 it is sweeter then they are left with very 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.399
 good taste finish two red blots that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.110
 are at a very good price we have with the 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.340
 pancetta I'm going to not add salt until 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.469
 the end because we remember that the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.079
 smoked bacon is already salted then 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.399
 that's quite important that I do not know 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.229
 go with the salt 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.060
 so then so let's go 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.149
 Sautéing a little bit of this I'm going to lower 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.159
 the heat intensity more or less to 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.509
 an average trend and what we're going to 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.520
 to do is to let it go cooking 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.679
 we cook until the vegetables that 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.569
 well blanditos like a ratatouille like 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.119
 a sautéed imagine after this about 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.799
 a delicious hamburger good 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.349
 we continue I have to do everything fast 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.020
 you promised to promise me several things and it's 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.479
 well here is Mr. chicken we have 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.800
 here two types of chicken cuts I have 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.040
 On one hand I have 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.630
 I show you cut and large breasts and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.310
 I have the ones as they are very smart short 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.740
 good as we're going to do this we start 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.750
 chick I have here some fish sticks 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.980
 we already did it sometime type snacks 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 but now we're going to see it on the grill 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.210
 from the bacon markets there I'll go 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.100
 to place four more or less because today 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.500
 we have a lot of kitchen 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.950
 there are many pieces of chicken breast 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.720
 there are pieces of chicken breast we are going to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.480
 save this that is called when saving 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760
 when we wrap with a fat 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.350
 that is called to the truth or this would be a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.990
 real chicken or if you want to give it a 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.500
 name suddenly more to more good you 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.160
 We are very good story we return to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.070
 repeat this 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.210
 and once again I'm going to do two more so 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.210
 less children we have 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.040
 and obviously this is not a portion I'm going 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.110
 to make a dressing forgiveness sorry but 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.450
 this can be a special mega dressing 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.460
 an idea dressing for the meats that go 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 on the grill look 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.440
 mustard here there are two tablespoons of 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.580
 mustard of scoop that says then the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.410
 Ticket to make it look good 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.880
 today I'm going to replace the salt pepper 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.400
 same as I have sauce here if they sting 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.950
 and more I'm going to make seasoned salt 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.680
 obviously also of scoop there goes to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.680
 go more or less I will do nothing 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.360
 has a little bit of pepper obviously 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.430
 we can not miss 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.220
 or not at all not garlic sauce there 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.900
 inside a droplet of garlic sauce who 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.200
 more like putting faults there were sounds 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.730
 ingredients plus droplets ratites nothing 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.010
 more soy sauce 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.080
 and juice of three lemons that I have here more 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 or less than two tablespoons of sauce 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.330
 soy juice of three lemons look there 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
 we mix this well and as well as 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.950
 this is the last thing I have left here 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.269
 they are green onions chopped just 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.980
 mixing this you seem to look at what 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.239
 this sanz and adds that the very smart 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.190
 cuts that can also be chips 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.019
 of chicken breast can also be 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.070
 the whole big thighs and that is why 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.070
 there is something 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.110
 this as well as this mask to rest 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.400
 15 minutes and then abraham ayala 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.260
 third chicken a stick of bros is 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 extremely easy that I was already 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.910
 advancing there take inserting several 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.220
 hearts that I will be watering is 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.700
 master easy from the I'll be easy 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.569
 again soy sauce 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.300
 in 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.490
 and I'm going to place eliminator cascaritas 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.399
 of orange yes to give it a flavor 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.249
 citrus fruit again we will go 

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:59.309
 with garlic sauce 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.539
 again later last 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:04.829
 ingredient in this case I wanted to add 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.109
 a spiced salt to the barbecue and a 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.819
 I tap just nothing and they stopped me for 

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:11.399
 can return this a twig of 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.619
 thyme is called ankle and if you can use 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.649
 rosemary also without any problem like that 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.079
 as it is since it is already hot 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.609
 well then look with the thyme 

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.579
 What are you going to do in your house, sir? 

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:25.949
 degree sir is lady lady and is for 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:27.149
 this teaches gives you the taste you do not know 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.369
 you the flavor that will happen to you because the 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.019
 Thyme is also going to heat up 

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.849
 then they give it a much richer wave 

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:34.949
 Citrus counted millán los corazoncitos 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.929
 with the soy sauce obviously that she 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.729
 it's very rich and then there you go 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.649
 a totally different flavor very 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.959
 interesting well doradito baires or 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.899
 I also looked at the chicken yesterday 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:48.959
 pansequito here in and also by 

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:51.520
 Last we are going to place the chicks that 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:54.129
 they have green onions 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.300
 well I also tell you that there are times 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:00.580
 you have children also on the grill and 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.840
 he's hungry since early 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.879
 as lazarito who already arrived here and 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.520
 always coincidentally comes at the same time good 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.259
 if children fall before he is 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.000
 the roast to solve that sanz and 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.000
 have the grill is hot and 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.710
 direct to the grill already come with their 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.210
 separators that facilitate everything well 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.210
 placing here to be able to transport 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:42.120
 very rich 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:48.250
 with which I put with onion 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:54.280
 we form the presentation it is clear that 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:56.229
 you can not miss the tomato tomato 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.940
 this is easy this after doing it in your 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:00.520
 home 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.520
 at home doing it on a Sunday 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:08.160
 will advance and grill a cheese 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.160
 for example if you want to increase the flavor 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.980
 we place the sautéing that we prepare 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.520
 with the purple onion white onion 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.110
 spectacular red morons and by 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.470
 last this little touch that we can 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.470
 lack 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:31.560
 to the kitchen but yes every perfect 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.560
 detail 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.330
 life
