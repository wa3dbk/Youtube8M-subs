00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.790
 states a hugely popular drink is 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.130
 very popular perhaps 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.520
 its stimulating power than in some 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.770
 so it gives us performance 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.439
 definitely better 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.660
 now it is good that we say coffee 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.060
 a milder action from the point of view 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.369
 depurative compared to other types of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.250
 other types of drinks but it is always 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.260
 appropriate with lahm posarne as the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.030
 coffee at one of the coffee properties 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.250
 definitely the one to stress 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.460
 the organism precisely because it contains 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.260
 just caffeine caffeine a use 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.810
 Prolonged precisely those of coffee 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 caffeine can cause problems 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.160
 hypertension can cause problems with 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.950
 for cholesterolemia and even of the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.920
 real cardiac cardiac own 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.970
 because it goes somehow to speed up the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.170
 heartbeat 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:06.310
 now in our say we say for those who love 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.890
 coffee is important to respect those 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.280
 which are the daily doses or not or 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.409
 better at least three coffee a day than 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.610
 the threshold of there is a maximum threshold from 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.440
 not exceed 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.729
 a tip for anyone who wants anyway 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.580
 also check your weight 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 body to take coffee after that 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.250
 with the above because it favors but one 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.950
 better management especially if 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.040
 taken a hold the metabolism of 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.400
 fat and therefore we say for those who have 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.010
 this problem also of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 strokes wanting to control the weight could 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.940
 be an adjunct but did not take 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 absolutely the recommended dose is of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.110
 do not exceed the recommended dose by a 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.890
 more coffee a day 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 just because in the long run a 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 continuously promptly killed of caffeine 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 can be released into the body and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.870
 thus causing the different different 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.450
 symptoms among which I will put it all 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.709
 and tachycardia , caffeine 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.660
 everyone can still take it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.940
 especially for those suffering from gastritis 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.300
 or because he suffers from colitis 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 however, it is good to avoid a little at least 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.400
 definitely prefers a coffee 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 decaffeinated
