00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
what to do and they are going to live

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.160 
what to do and they are going to live
with<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.220> results<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.420> several<00:02:30.750> years<00:02:30.990> in

with the results for several years in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.230 
with the results for several years in
future<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.760> important<00:02:33.210> for

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
future and then it's very important for

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.870 
future and then it's very important for
me<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> have<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.470> road<00:02:35.190> as<00:02:35.370> well

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.650 

my<00:02:38.880> vision<00:02:39.300> was<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.900> two<00:02:40.170> suppliers<00:02:41.660> we

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
my vision was to have two suppliers we

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.450 
my vision was to have two suppliers we
were<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.470> planning<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:43.920> buying<00:02:44.130> three

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
were with planning on buying three

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.900 
were with planning on buying three
printers<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:46.020> we<00:02:46.440> thought<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:47.010> two<00:02:47.610> prints

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
printers so we thought that two prints

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.370 
printers so we thought that two prints
from<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.210> company<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:48.990> for<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.260> other

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
from one company and one for the other

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.130 
from one company and one for the other
company<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.760> tested<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.420> other<00:02:51.570> printer<00:02:51.960> for

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
company we tested the other printer for

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.160 
company we tested the other printer for
one<00:02:52.290> mile<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.800> after<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:54.540> turn<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.080> away

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
one mile and after that we turn it away

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.730 
one mile and after that we turn it away
and<00:02:55.620> bought<00:02:56.340> another<00:02:56.640> printer<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.180> Rico

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
and bought another printer from Rico
