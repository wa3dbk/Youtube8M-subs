see<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.269> original<00:00:40.660> Castlevania<00:00:41.289> was<00:00:41.469> awesome

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
see the original Castlevania was awesome

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.250 
see the original Castlevania was awesome
because<00:00:42.370> its<00:00:42.550> creators<00:00:42.969> were<00:00:43.149> insanely<00:00:43.690> anal

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
because its creators were insanely anal

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.860 
because its creators were insanely anal
about<00:00:44.410> timing<00:00:44.980> spacing<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.179> in<00:00:46.390> game<00:00:46.600> physics

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
about timing spacing and in game physics

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.930 
about timing spacing and in game physics
it<00:00:47.260> was<00:00:47.379> slow<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.649> sticky<00:00:48.249> but<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.550> worked

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
it was slow and sticky but it worked

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.419 
it was slow and sticky but it worked
because<00:00:49.539> you<00:00:49.629> always<00:00:49.839> had<00:00:50.170> just<00:00:50.199> enough<00:00:51.010> space

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
because you always had just enough space

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.669 
because you always had just enough space
to<00:00:51.820> make<00:00:52.030> your<00:00:52.210> jumps<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:52.809> whip<00:00:53.170> your<00:00:53.379> enemy

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
to make your jumps and whip your enemy

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.020 
to make your jumps and whip your enemy
is<00:00:53.800> if<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.039> were<00:00:54.100> patient<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:54.789> paid

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
is if you were patient and you paid

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.329 
is if you were patient and you paid
attention<00:00:55.179> you<00:00:55.659> had<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:56.050> play<00:00:56.230> slowly<00:00:56.710> but<00:00:57.219> it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
attention you had to play slowly but it

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.399 
attention you had to play slowly but it
was<00:00:57.460> still<00:00:57.670> fun<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:58.329> was<00:00:58.480> like<00:00:58.629> taking<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.199> walk

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
was still fun it was like taking a walk

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.229 
was still fun it was like taking a walk
with<00:00:59.440> your<00:00:59.679> grandma<00:01:00.190> she<00:01:00.249> was<00:01:00.640> super<00:01:00.999> cool<00:01:01.179> and
