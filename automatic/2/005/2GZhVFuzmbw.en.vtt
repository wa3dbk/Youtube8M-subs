so I have no anything Rika uploading so
hopefully<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.660> works<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.140> right

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
hopefully this works out all right

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.450 
hopefully this works out all right
because<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.960> nice<00:00:31.380> menu<00:00:34.460> very

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
because you can see here nice menu very

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.040 
because you can see here nice menu very
well<00:00:35.610> developed<00:00:35.760> oh<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.630> bonding<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
well developed oh it's just bonding and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.930 
well developed oh it's just bonding and
just<00:00:37.200> wait<00:00:37.350> for<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.829> believe<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.520> enter<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
just wait for it I believe or enter I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
just wait for it I believe or enter I
think<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.329> game<00:00:45.539> does<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.930> damage

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
think so this game does not have damage

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.729 
think so this game does not have damage
yet<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.719> it<00:00:48.719> does<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.530> awesome

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
yet but it does have some pretty awesome

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.729 
yet but it does have some pretty awesome
driving<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:52.140> wait<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> load

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
driving so just wait for it to load

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400 
driving so just wait for it to load
there<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.160> are

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.900 

so<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> turn<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.489> our<00:00:56.610> engine<00:00:58.910> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so we have to turn on our engine they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
so we have to turn on our engine they
turn<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.210> volume<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.020> hear<00:01:01.140> this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
turn my volume up so you can hear this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.180 
turn my volume up so you can hear this
better

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
better

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.680 
better
all<00:01:04.190> right<00:01:04.339> hopefully<00:01:04.879> it's<00:01:05.150> not<00:01:05.300> too<00:01:05.360> loud

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
all right hopefully it's not too loud

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.290 
all right hopefully it's not too loud
hello<00:01:06.380> gotta<00:01:07.250> carve<00:01:07.520> does<00:01:07.940> spike<00:01:08.180> in

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
hello gotta carve does spike in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.710 
hello gotta carve does spike in
acceleration<00:01:09.070> but<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:10.610> as<00:01:10.880> you<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:11.120> see<00:01:11.300> just

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
acceleration but but as you can see just

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.980 
acceleration but but as you can see just
just<00:01:12.200> look<00:01:12.619> at<00:01:12.740> how<00:01:12.830> smooth<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.369> rides<00:01:13.990> and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
just look at how smooth this rides and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.109 
just look at how smooth this rides and
you<00:01:15.170> can<00:01:15.320> see<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:16.040> know<00:01:16.070> most<00:01:16.880> cars

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
you can see here you know most cars

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.660 
you can see here you know most cars
he'll<00:01:17.330> get<00:01:17.450> stuck<00:01:17.720> like<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:19.610> know

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
he'll get stuck like that and you know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.100 
he'll get stuck like that and you know
nor<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.690> smooth<00:01:20.990> bumps

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
nor the smooth bumps

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.760 
nor the smooth bumps
pretty<00:01:24.110> nice<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.560> why<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:26.000> smooth<00:01:26.360> like

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
pretty nice to you why very smooth like

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.609 
pretty nice to you why very smooth like
it's<00:01:27.770> not<00:01:27.890> exactly<00:01:28.250> yd<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:28.880> just<00:01:29.030> kind<00:01:29.210> of

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
it's not exactly yd it's just kind of

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.219 
it's not exactly yd it's just kind of
not<00:01:30.619> as<00:01:30.740> smooth<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.540> needs<00:01:32.690> a<00:01:32.869> refresh

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
not as smooth like it needs a refresh

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.830 
not as smooth like it needs a refresh
faster<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.830> way<00:01:34.060> as<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.180> can<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.660> is

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
faster in the way as you can this is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.020 
faster in the way as you can this is
like<00:01:35.990> very<00:01:36.500> very<00:01:36.800> short<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.310> map<00:01:37.520> though<00:01:37.729> but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
like very very short of a map though but

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.969 
like very very short of a map though but
I<00:01:38.300> mean<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.960> look<00:01:39.289> at<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:39.530> it's<00:01:39.770> kind<00:01:39.950> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I mean just look at this it's kind of

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.330 
I mean just look at this it's kind of
like<00:01:40.130> real<00:01:40.340> suspension<00:01:40.910> sort<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.710> its<00:01:42.710> sky

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
like real suspension sort of its sky

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.880 
like real suspension sort of its sky
tracking<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:43.940> all<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:44.930> he's<00:01:45.380> headed

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
tracking and all that so he's headed

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.969 
tracking and all that so he's headed
rock<00:01:46.899> he<00:01:47.899> probably<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:48.289> gonna<00:01:48.440> add<00:01:48.619> damage

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
rock he probably is gonna add damage

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.889 
rock he probably is gonna add damage
later<00:01:49.130> more<00:01:49.550> cars<00:01:49.789> more<00:01:49.940> map<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.630> seating

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
later more cars more map and the seating

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.889 
later more cars more map and the seating
counts<00:01:51.289> are<00:01:51.649> constantly<00:01:52.130> updated<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.840> want<00:01:53.840> to
