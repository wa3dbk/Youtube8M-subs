muscles and we could say to hell with a
liver<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.369> let<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.060> brain<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.689> shot<00:01:36.990> he's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
liver right let the brain be shot he's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.200 
liver right let the brain be shot he's
got<00:01:37.470> great<00:01:37.770> abs<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.729> doesn't<00:01:39.030> make<00:01:39.090> any
