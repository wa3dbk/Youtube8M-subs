00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 video like this is a new video and good 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.570
 we are in this that is following and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.010
 how many times we repeat we are in this 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.900
 now and we are in this and we are in 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.519
 this for guys that's a new block 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 of commands and his new command as 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.309
 benasque a description is the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 very famous a look and blog or like the 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 block of bad luck may be 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 tell us how the block look and blog 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.770
 of luck not here is a look and blog 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.469
 so good guys let's see how 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 is this new command you have to remember 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 which is for 1888 and is vanilla 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 we do not need anything or anything else 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 I was going to tell you what we have done 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 a description always left the link 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 I always leave a link where you give 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 click and it will send you directly to a 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.329
 page where the whole command is because 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.700
 I do not put the command directly 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.770
 good for two reasons number one because 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.560
 it is not a command exclusively mine and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 number two because they are very very commands 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.509
 long I do not want to fill a description 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.649
 of a command this is what I do not want and 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.210
 well you know the first thing 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.200
 we need your file what's coming 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.990
 being necessarily forcibly if it is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.930
 a command not all we put the command 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.289
 you know what you put there you give him here and so 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.960
 copies what is basically being 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.509
 the command do not hit it you know you give me 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.830
 ready once this exists because the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.780
 so it's more correct 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.000
 think a lot about germany guys and good 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.610
 this is what the image has been 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 advances the whole machine and the creator in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 reality is to that mask he is 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.909
 trainer of this this uses a lot 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 people when you can not use many 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.020
 we will settle or simply your 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.789
 computer does not come to mossos be 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.409
 Purely good minecraft are installed 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.810
 Well this can be used without any 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.420
 problem as I said the command is done 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.959
 for more or less than and jaén minecraft 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.580
 is here says right click to get 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.140
 the items and well already once 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.319
 we have the items what we are is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 put this that is being the cauldron and 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.700
 pp for releasing what has been 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.500
 basically the flint in once 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 that we already have this then now if 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.239
 I put it here this this this 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.330
 date for people who do not know how to do 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.560
 the solved and it's to undo 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.140
 basically this is nothing else for the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.769
 unique that serves to break what comes 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.360
 being the torch that black not good 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.910
 Now that we need good guys 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.299
 we need what is being like 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.239
 another tweet what is the famous look 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.950
 a look of forgiveness and we will do 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.900
 through flint like that in your others here 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.670
 the flint hopped over using and the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.069
 flint when it's flints you want 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.930
 drop in this case I think I'm going to 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.910
 leave the complete state is not 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.780
 full 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:10.690
 is already good 63-64 to leave a 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.519
 little bit of this to go putting here I'm going 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.160
 to put a book and how do you count 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.470
 now 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.470
 red and this we break without light 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.610
 or it brought the luck of three men 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.570
 giants more 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.010
 the resonating dynamite one of us what 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.010
 we break and again we do not care 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.040
 we proposed and this nothing is that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.190

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.800

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.190

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.760
 you do not get armor there 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.240
