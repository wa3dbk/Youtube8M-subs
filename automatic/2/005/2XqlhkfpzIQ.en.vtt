 Here is such an unusual phone 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:20.910

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.980
 I can say about the appearance well in 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:18.640
 principle very thin phone me he 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:22.120
 I like the lightweight buttons absolutely no 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.230
 no touch ie buttons on 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.340
 screen but just want to say one thing 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.450
 minus the screen is very brand 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.150
 constantly have to wipe it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.819
 a rag many write about the screen alone 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 they say that the screen 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.670
 glass burned eye or similarity 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.129
 others say that from quality 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.870
 plastic in principle just in case 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.599

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.400
 there is a small notch 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.890
 such forward movements we 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.890
 open the phone
