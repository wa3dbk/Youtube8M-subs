yeah<00:04:48.520> see<00:04:48.820> they<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.240> even<00:04:49.720> consume<00:04:50.199> oh<00:04:50.530> I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
yeah see they have even consume oh I

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.159 
yeah see they have even consume oh I
thought<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:51.070> was<00:04:51.220> water<00:04:52.020> seen<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.139> bottom

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
thought that was water seen the bottom

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.810 
thought that was water seen the bottom
right<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:53.949> how<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.220> has<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.550> taint

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
right there how it has the taint

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.779 
right there how it has the taint
detector<00:04:55.680> well<00:04:56.680> they<00:04:56.830> are<00:04:56.950> spreading<00:04:57.430> out

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
detector well they are spreading out

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.350 
detector well they are spreading out
like<00:04:58.599> they're<00:04:58.780> moving<00:04:59.050> around<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:01.060> basically

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
like they're moving around so basically

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.760 
like they're moving around so basically
when<00:05:01.630> they<00:05:01.720> move<00:05:01.930> around<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.500> chopped<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
when they move around I chopped the

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.409 
when they move around I chopped the
bunch<00:05:03.130> them<00:05:03.340> down<00:05:03.490> here<00:05:03.729> as<00:05:03.849> you<00:05:04.060> can<00:05:04.090> see<00:05:04.210> the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
bunch them down here as you can see the

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.070 
bunch them down here as you can see the
blocks<00:05:04.660> will<00:05:04.960> gradually<00:05:05.530> turn<00:05:06.039> back<00:05:06.370> into<00:05:07.080> I

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
blocks will gradually turn back into I

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.980 
blocks will gradually turn back into I
look<00:05:08.349> a<00:05:08.440> little<00:05:08.560> crystal<00:05:09.780> eventually<00:05:10.780> turn

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
look a little crystal eventually turn

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.310 
look a little crystal eventually turn
back<00:05:11.260> into<00:05:11.500> regular<00:05:12.389> blocks<00:05:13.389> which<00:05:13.720> I<00:05:13.930> really

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
back into regular blocks which I really

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.960 
back into regular blocks which I really
don't<00:05:14.500> like<00:05:14.590> because<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.310> tainted<00:05:15.729> stuff

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
don't like because the tainted stuff

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.029 
don't like because the tainted stuff
looks<00:05:16.180> really<00:05:16.479> cool<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:17.740> almost<00:05:17.889> like

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
looks really cool it's almost like

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.279 
looks really cool it's almost like
Mother<00:05:18.460> Nature's<00:05:18.880> trying<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.150> fight<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.389> off

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.360 

whoa<00:05:25.590> concentrate<00:05:26.590> okay<00:05:26.919> here's<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.250> thing

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
whoa concentrate okay here's the thing

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.770 
whoa concentrate okay here's the thing
what<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:27.639> can<00:05:27.820> actually<00:05:27.940> use<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.270> spread<00:05:28.539> it<00:05:28.660> I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
what you can actually use to spread it I

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.189 
what you can actually use to spread it I
guess<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:30.340> if<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.849> hate<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.570> land<00:05:31.810> you

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
guess so if you just hate the land you

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.379 
guess so if you just hate the land you
want<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.680> join<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:32.949> flood<00:05:33.430> because<00:05:33.970> grave

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
want to join the flood because grave

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.469 
want to join the flood because grave
