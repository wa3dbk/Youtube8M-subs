00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
head plates obviously we've got the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
head plates obviously we've got the
different<00:01:46.290> sizes<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.119> we<00:01:48.119> look<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
different sizes here we look at the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.640 
different sizes here we look at the
horses<00:01:49.079> back<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> second

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.590 

you<00:01:53.160> should<00:01:53.310> find<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> end<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.120> scapula

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you should find the end of the scapula

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.010 
you should find the end of the scapula
the<00:01:54.870> point<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.220> farthest<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.480> if

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the point that is farthest back and if

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.660 
the point that is farthest back and if
you<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.320> three<00:01:58.620> fingers<00:01:58.650> behind<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you put three fingers behind that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090 
you put three fingers behind that
scapula<00:02:00.090> you've<00:02:00.900> got<00:02:01.050> normal<00:02:01.380> sized<00:02:01.590> fingers

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
scapula you've got normal sized fingers

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.420 
scapula you've got normal sized fingers
that<00:02:02.580> should<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.150> five<00:02:03.630> centimeters<00:02:04.430> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that should be about five centimeters so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.999 
that should be about five centimeters so
we<00:02:05.550> want<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.000> point<00:02:06.300> five<00:02:07.020> centimeters<00:02:07.770> back

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
we want this point five centimeters back

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.440 
we want this point five centimeters back
behind<00:02:08.490> shoulder<00:02:09.179> blade<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:11.640> relation<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
behind shoulder blade in relation to the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.330 
behind shoulder blade in relation to the
head<00:02:12.600> plate<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.710> center<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.160> this

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
head plate that's the center of this

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.490 
head plate that's the center of this
little<00:02:14.640> circle<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:16.050> we're<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.470> put

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
little circle here so we're going to put

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.570 
little circle here so we're going to put
place<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.130> head<00:02:17.280> plate<00:02:18.110> there<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.580> what

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
place the head plate there and what

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.550 
place the head plate there and what
we're<00:02:20.760> looking<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> angle<00:02:22.470> of

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
we're looking for is that the angle of

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.300 
we're looking for is that the angle of
this<00:02:22.710> arm<00:02:24.290> follows<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.500> angle<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.100> hulls

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
this arm follows the angle of the hulls

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.280 
this arm follows the angle of the hulls
we're<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> be<00:02:27.660> worried<00:02:28.020> about<00:02:28.110> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
we're not going to be worried about a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.790 
we're not going to be worried about a
little<00:02:28.530> bit<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.860> rocking<00:02:29.780> because<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:31.530> have

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
little bit of rocking because we do have

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.390 
little bit of rocking because we do have
in<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.970> center<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:34.020> our<00:02:34.400> fill

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
in the center of this we have our fill

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.210 
in the center of this we have our fill
it<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.420> make<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.959> sit<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.160> little

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
it which will make this sit up a little

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.040 
it which will make this sit up a little
bit<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> person<00:02:39.180> spine<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.900> we're

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
bit of a person spine so what we're

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.150 
bit of a person spine so what we're
looking<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.490> consistent

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
looking for is that we get a consistent

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.050 
looking for is that we get a consistent
angle<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:45.390> opposed<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.400> which<00:02:47.610> is

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
angle as opposed to this one which is

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.760 
angle as opposed to this one which is
too<00:02:48.360> wide<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:54.440> which<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.470> too

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
too wide and this one which is too

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.800 
too wide and this one which is too
narrow<00:02:58.430> okay<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.760> here's<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.330> perfect<00:03:00.540> line

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
narrow okay so here's the perfect line

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
narrow okay so here's the perfect line
again<00:03:01.400> five<00:03:02.400> centimeters<00:03:03.120> back<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.400> that's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
again five centimeters back and that's

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.369 
again five centimeters back and that's
where<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.769> more<00:03:07.769> consistent<00:03:08.840> angle

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
where we have more consistent angle

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.600 
where we have more consistent angle
okay<00:03:13.330> okay<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.480> one<00:03:14.629> thing<00:03:14.840> we<00:03:14.989> haven't<00:03:15.230> said

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
okay okay the one thing we haven't said

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.809 
okay okay the one thing we haven't said
is<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:18.019> head<00:03:18.230> plate<00:03:18.530> should<00:03:19.459> not<00:03:19.670> be

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
is that the head plate should not be

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.839 
is that the head plate should not be
held<00:03:19.970> vertical<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.650> should<00:03:21.860> actually<00:03:22.099> be<00:03:22.610> held

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
held vertical it should actually be held

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.550 
held vertical it should actually be held
at<00:03:23.090> 45<00:03:23.870> degrees<00:03:24.379> as<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:26.540> sits<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.170> saddle

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
at 45 degrees as it sits in the saddle

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.759 
at 45 degrees as it sits in the saddle
so<00:03:28.430> there's<00:03:29.330> your<00:03:29.420> three<00:03:29.750> fingers<00:03:29.959> there's

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
so there's your three fingers there's

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.580 
so there's your three fingers there's
the<00:03:30.980> center<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.370> your<00:03:31.430> circle<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:33.410> head

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
the center of your circle and the head

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.570 
the center of your circle and the head
and<00:03:33.739> play<00:03:34.060> pointing<00:03:35.060> backwards<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.769> about<00:03:37.549> a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
and play pointing backwards so about a

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.510 
and play pointing backwards so about a
45<00:03:38.150> degree<00:03:38.299> angle
