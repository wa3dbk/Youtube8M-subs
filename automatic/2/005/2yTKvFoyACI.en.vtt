00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 to say of gynecologists and obstetricians 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.060
 of the Mexican social security institute 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.940
 normal delivery is preferable to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.120
 cesarean section what are the advantages of a 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.120
 health of a vaginal delivery in relation to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 the caesarean cesarean section has as 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.710
 any surgical event has its 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
 risks the risks as any 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.350
 surgery 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.980
 the patient who undergoes a cesarean in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.700
 future pregnancies have certain 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 risk factors one of them and what 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.920
 reason why it has been 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.129
 increased the morbidity and mortality of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.579
 our obstetric patients is the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.789
 hemorrhage that has favored as a factor 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.360
 of the antecedent of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 surgeries in obstetric patients the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.899
 recovery of women who have been 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.270
 surgically removed is slow and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.090
 are those most at risk one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 cesarean section after surgery we 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 favors a later recovery 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.280
 it takes up to three months to recover 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
 with everything inherent in a surgery 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.420
 recent wound care 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 surgical scar the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.930
 recovery of the same limits 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.479
 including breastfeeding in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 occasions for that for that recovery 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 slow when it is interrupted abdominal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 and being a normal delivery then a birth 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.070
 authentic favors immediately the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 recovery in seven days the woman 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 current 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.210
 that almost more than 80% work 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.190
 Incorporates in 15 days is already working 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.710
 then the recovery obviously 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.929
 is faster is less the risk of 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 complications of infection is equal 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.729
 also the patient who undergoes 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.009
 surgery there is a risk that you can acquire 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.690
 infections therefore the authorities 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.429
 have given priority to deliveries 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.520
 normal and consequently the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.170
 infections have also decreased 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.900
 awareness to the companions 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.540
 operational 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.950
 a second opinion especially in the 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.470
 woman who is going to have her first baby 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.709
 when you already have a history of one or 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.110
 two surgeries times it's almost almost equal to 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.459
 surgery even though in the caesarean section 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.050
 previous a patient who has 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.370
 antecedents a cesarean section still 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.099
 We are giving opportunity for it to be 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.720
 a normal delivery the primiparous true is 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.580
 the one that has the first baby that 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.240
 is going to have the first baby is the one 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.550
 we make the second opinion 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.360
 and monitoring by us as 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.100
 directives the precise indications or 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.960
 be absolute if it is going to be via 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.460
 abdominal that is an indication 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.740
 absolute for the resolution of pregnancy 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.850
 that is not a personal appreciation 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.170
 particular because surgery 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.300
 unfortunately in our environment already 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.150
 commented the favio lawyer at the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.860
 the situation is handled a lot 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.950
 economic the monetary situation the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.760
 monetary issue but but at the level 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.459
 institutional 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.430
 there is a certain factor as a risk to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.180
 litigation I solve and I take off 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.310
 problem then that's another factor that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.750
 we are removing informs us for 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.989
 anoticiar in our patricia vision 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.989
