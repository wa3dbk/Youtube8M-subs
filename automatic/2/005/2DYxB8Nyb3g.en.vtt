model<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.850> lot<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.180> step<00:03:46.840> up

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
model with a with a lot of step up

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.790 
model with a with a lot of step up
features<00:03:47.519> now<00:03:48.519> just<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.600> overall<00:03:49.930> on<00:03:50.410> these

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
features now just the overall on these

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.410 
features now just the overall on these
new<00:03:50.950> power<00:03:51.160> shots<00:03:51.430> there's<00:03:52.000> some<00:03:52.239> new

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
new power shots there's some new

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.820 
new power shots there's some new
technology<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.080> were<00:03:53.290> introducing<00:03:53.709> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
technology that were introducing the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.580 
technology that were introducing the
disc<00:03:54.010> loser<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.430> Canon<00:03:54.790> one<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.930> them<00:03:56.080> is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
disc loser to Canon one of them is

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.410 
disc loser to Canon one of them is
called<00:03:56.709> motion<00:03:57.310> detection<00:03:57.610> technology<00:03:58.209> and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
called motion detection technology and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.180 
called motion detection technology and
the<00:03:59.080> idea<00:03:59.320> here<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.830> we're<00:04:00.160> actually

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
the idea here is that we're actually

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.880 
the idea here is that we're actually
looking<00:04:00.790> at<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.480> subject<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.350> determining

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
looking at the subject and determining

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.250 
looking at the subject and determining
whether<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.310> moving<00:04:03.700> or<00:04:03.820> stationary<00:04:04.260> what

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
whether it's moving or stationary what

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.630 
whether it's moving or stationary what
we'll<00:04:05.380> do<00:04:05.530> with<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.739> information<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.489> to

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
we'll do with that information is to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.690 
we'll do with that information is to
adjust<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.030> ISO<00:04:07.600> speed<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.370> what<00:04:09.580> we'll

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
adjust the ISO speed and so what we'll

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.699 
adjust the ISO speed and so what we'll
do<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:09.880> basically<00:04:10.510> raised<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.140> ISO<00:04:11.530> when

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
do is basically raised the ISO when

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.530 
do is basically raised the ISO when
motion<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.100> detected<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.850> has<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.239> ripple

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
motion is detected that has the ripple

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.910 
motion is detected that has the ripple
effect<00:04:13.630> of<00:04:13.989> raising<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.410> shutter<00:04:14.620> speed<00:04:14.890> to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
effect of raising the shutter speed to

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.699 
effect of raising the shutter speed to
stop<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.400> motion<00:04:15.580> blur<00:04:16.140> also<00:04:17.140> across<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
stop the motion blur also across the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.170 
stop the motion blur also across the
powershot<00:04:18.039> line<00:04:18.190> yeah<00:04:18.640> it's<00:04:18.850> basically

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
powershot line yeah it's basically

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.330 
powershot line yeah it's basically
available<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.720> all<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.960> new<00:04:20.049> cameras<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:21.220> we

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
available in all the new cameras and we

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.640 
available in all the new cameras and we
also<00:04:21.460> have<00:04:21.580> a<00:04:21.729> situation<00:04:22.720> where<00:04:23.169> when<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
also have a situation where when the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.100 
also have a situation where when the
stationary<00:04:24.160> stationery<00:04:24.639> subject<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.720> ISO

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
stationary stationery subject the ISO

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.150 
stationary stationery subject the ISO
will<00:04:26.229> be<00:04:26.320> lowered<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:26.880> less<00:04:27.880> noise<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:29.770> one

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
will be lowered for less noise in one

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.610 
will be lowered for less noise in one
very<00:04:30.669> last<00:04:30.850> feature<00:04:31.110> which<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.139> kind<00:04:32.440> of<00:04:32.500> hard

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
very last feature which is kind of hard

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.290 
very last feature which is kind of hard
to<00:04:32.710> demonstrate<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.160> camera<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:34.060> a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
to demonstrate on camera but it's a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.240 
to demonstrate on camera but it's a
feature<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.660> we're<00:04:34.900> calling<00:04:35.199> AF<00:04:35.620> point<00:04:35.979> zoom

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
feature that we're calling AF point zoom

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.969 
feature that we're calling AF point zoom
and<00:04:36.610> it's<00:04:36.820> very<00:04:36.970> useful<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:38.289> ties<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.770> with<00:04:38.889> the

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
and it's very useful it ties in with the

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.379 
and it's very useful it ties in with the
face<00:04:39.130> detection<00:04:39.310> technology<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.300> what

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
face detection technology and what

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.719 
face detection technology and what
happens<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.840> that<00:04:41.020> when<00:04:41.199> you<00:04:41.590> are<00:04:41.800> looking<00:04:42.220> at

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
happens is that when you are looking at

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.490 
happens is that when you are looking at
the<00:04:42.970> screen<00:04:43.449> on<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.720> camera<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.169> press<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the screen on the camera and press the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.870 
the screen on the camera and press the
shutter<00:04:44.650> button<00:04:44.770> down<00:04:45.130> halfway<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.759> will

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
shutter button down halfway it will

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.060 
shutter button down halfway it will
actually<00:04:46.000> digitally<00:04:46.780> zoom<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.169> face<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.919> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
actually digitally zoom the face up to a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.490 
actually digitally zoom the face up to a
higher<00:04:48.310> magnification<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.330> that's<00:04:50.229> very

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
higher magnification and that's very

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.010 
higher magnification and that's very
very<00:04:50.710> practical<00:04:51.280> because<00:04:51.460> it<00:04:52.060> makes<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.810> so

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
very practical because it makes it so

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.390 
very practical because it makes it so
that<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.229> can<00:04:53.380> tell<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.680> at<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.860> glance<00:04:54.070> whether

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
that you can tell it at a glance whether

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.040 
that you can tell it at a glance whether
the<00:04:54.610> subject<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.090> smiling<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.600> way<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.780> want

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
the subject is smiling the way you want

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.629 
the subject is smiling the way you want
or<00:04:56.289> they<00:04:56.590> have<00:04:56.770> their<00:04:56.889> eyes<00:04:57.039> open<00:04:57.220> or<00:04:57.460> closed

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
or they have their eyes open or closed

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.490 
or they have their eyes open or closed
what<00:04:58.090> about<00:04:58.180> availability<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.199> all<00:04:59.350> these

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
