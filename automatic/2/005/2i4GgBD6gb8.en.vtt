00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello today let's compare the window with 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.340
 by manufacturers like 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.890
 cog in pentek and these specimens are 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.060
 the fatal euro 70 is obtained assembly 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.060
 foam 70 millimeters 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:36.290
 five-chamber profile goes glass pack with 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.290
 we will watch two-chamber now 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.579
 accessories here we can 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 look at our varistors 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:58.219
 coming now 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:01:02.570
 what profile is written on 1 butt 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.570
 Austrian poppy headset 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 misses on doubt that abruptly here 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 let's allow for airing very gently and 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 smooth look does not fall does not fall off 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 smoothly released 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 the same opening all works softly 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:43.900
 and closures very happy hardware 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 what works 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:55.590
 differences on the seal look 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:00.280
 rehau petal seal much 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 better not so freezes like this 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.490
 a plus 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.890
 then there are double-glazed windows outside 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:15.160
 compacted much better and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:22.800
 right between the dock kennetu here 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:26.070
 there is a solid seal already from 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.660
 inside there is a chick 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.660
 Well here it is seen not so important 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.110
 as if in this plus then we look 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.350
 mount here go z-shaped such 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.780
 brackets 4 pieces i.e. if 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:53.410
 order mosquito net then we must 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.410
 distance from here to here to measure and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.210
 order grid plus is that it is not necessary 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.940
 drill a profile compared to 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:09.350
 what kind of outdoor mounts in 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.990
 these mounts plus you don't need anything 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.990
 drill 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:20.390
 Only here the mosquito net screw and 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:23.060
 drove all the further we look at the installation here 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.660
 4 anchors such a small window 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.660
 fastens 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.230
 double-glazed window as possible 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 check the easy way 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:52.349
 if not everyone can see it 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:57.879
 the way to easily determine how much is here 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.489
 glass three glass means two cameras all 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.970
 elementary way to determine which one you are 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:11.260
 glass package brought or whatever 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:17.010
 order a bead strict as if nothing 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.010
 special well and neat good 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.800
 everything is done very clearly without 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.210
 all sorts of badass bead put on the spot 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.139
 it is clear that production is doing well 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.050
 well, how would 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:46.090
 These are the advantages of sin profile more 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.090
 wide mounting depth of 70 millimeters 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:53.050
 sound insulation perfect with 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.689
 two-chamber double-glazed window 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:03.099
 just shut it immediately they can not hear the scientist 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:09.500
 in the room, there are such things 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:14.419
 We look at the window sill with such about the market not 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.849
 rains in producers minus what's the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.439
 the ends need something to glue under your 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.740
 slightly hooked baby and flies off as well 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:32.270
 principle 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:38.349
 polyurethane foam is fine here 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:43.449
 rehau windows 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:48.199
 how could they not be so expensive but 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:51.589
 quality is not bad compared to other 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:55.099
 manufacturers so advise 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:58.279
 five-chamber profile and two cameras 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.009
 double glazing ideal for 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:04.960
 office apartments 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.960
 good luck to you all
