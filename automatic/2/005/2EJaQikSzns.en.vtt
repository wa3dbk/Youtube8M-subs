00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
is different that's nicely done and so I

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.550 
is different that's nicely done and so I
went

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.210 

and<00:01:24.950> if<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.430> choosing<00:01:25.790> no<00:01:25.909> game<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:27.799> way<00:01:27.979> that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
and if it choosing no game the way that

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.260 
and if it choosing no game the way that
happens<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:29.030> really<00:01:29.299> cool<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.909> let's<00:01:31.909> go<00:01:32.090> back

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
happens is really cool so let's go back

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.859 
happens is really cool so let's go back
and<00:01:32.509> try<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> six<00:01:33.229> by<00:01:33.439> six<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:38.270> can<00:01:38.509> go<00:01:38.659> to

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
and try a six by six you can go to

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:49.359 
and try a six by six you can go to
players<00:01:39.170> 6<00:01:39.590> by<00:01:39.799> 6<00:01:42.340> lyrics<00:01:43.340> player<00:01:43.640> 0<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.979> then

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
players 6 by 6 lyrics player 0 and then

00:01:49.369 --> 00:02:02.529 
players 6 by 6 lyrics player 0 and then
this<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.759> idea<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.149> get<00:01:51.820> four<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.179> row<00:02:01.539> so

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
this the idea is to get four in a row so

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:12.050 
this the idea is to get four in a row so
I'll<00:02:03.439> them<00:02:03.709> that<00:02:03.920> our<00:02:04.299> player<00:02:05.299> X<00:02:05.539> means<00:02:05.810> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
simple game but the interface is really

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.110
