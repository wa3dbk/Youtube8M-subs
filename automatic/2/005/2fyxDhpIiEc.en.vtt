00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
a very tough comparison to make most

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.810 
a very tough comparison to make most
people<00:00:18.090> don't<00:00:19.080> realize<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.890> costs<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.550> are

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
people don't realize the costs that are

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.640 
people don't realize the costs that are
involved<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> seeing<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.720> medical<00:00:22.080> doctor<00:00:22.230> they

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
involved in seeing a medical doctor they

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
involved in seeing a medical doctor they
go<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.820> hand<00:00:24.510> their<00:00:24.660> insurance<00:00:24.990> card<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
go so I hand their insurance card and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.370 
go so I hand their insurance card and
then<00:00:26.010> say<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> 10<00:00:26.730> 20<00:00:27.090> dollar<00:00:27.269> copay

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
then say a 10 20 dollar copay

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
then say a 10 20 dollar copay
so<00:00:29.250> that's<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.609> they<00:00:29.760> pay<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.539> don't

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so that's all they pay and they don't

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
so that's all they pay and they don't
know<00:00:30.869> actually<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.099> insurance<00:00:32.520> company

people without insurance know this very

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
people without insurance know this very
well<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.700> costly<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> pay<00:00:39.450> a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
mean they go to many years of school

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
mean they go to many years of school
have<00:00:43.320> many<00:00:43.530> costs<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> overhead<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have many costs it a lot of overhead to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.950 
have many costs it a lot of overhead to
run<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> facility<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.120> depends<00:00:48.450> one

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
run a facility so it really depends one

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.180 
run a facility so it really depends one

there is a cost upfront say if insurance

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800 
there is a cost upfront say if insurance
doesn't<00:01:55.590> cover<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.390> teaching

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
people don't realize how much did labs

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890 
people don't realize how much did labs
cost<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.549> doctor<00:02:31.939> is<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.150> whole<00:02:32.359> slew<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.659> them

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
cost to a doctor is a whole slew of them

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.740 
cost to a doctor is a whole slew of them
and<00:02:33.140> insurance<00:02:34.010> may<00:02:34.250> pick<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.609> up<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:35.599> they

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and insurance may pick it up but if they

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.410 
and insurance may pick it up but if they
were<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> pay<00:02:36.109> for<00:02:36.349> those<00:02:36.549> out-of-pocket<00:02:37.549> it

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
were to pay for those out-of-pocket it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.589 
were to pay for those out-of-pocket it
could<00:02:38.599> be<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> pretty<00:02:38.959> hefty<00:02:39.260> bill<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.599> and

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
could be a pretty hefty bill and so and

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.129 
could be a pretty hefty bill and so and
so<00:02:41.629> that's<00:02:42.530> an<00:02:42.799> issue<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.760> cost<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.299> well<00:02:44.450> but

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
so that's an issue with cost as well but

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.800 
so that's an issue with cost as well but
in<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.590> long<00:02:45.769> run<00:02:46.299> despite<00:02:47.299> having<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.659> pay

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
in the long run despite having to pay

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.660 
in the long run despite having to pay
for<00:02:48.170> supplemental<00:02:49.129> costs

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
for supplemental costs

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.460 
for supplemental costs
despite<00:02:50.209> maybe<00:02:50.480> having<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.900> pay<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.079> little

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
despite maybe having to pay a little

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.619 
despite maybe having to pay a little
more<00:02:51.620> money<00:02:51.859> for<00:02:52.190> some<00:02:52.459> organic<00:02:52.940> foods<00:02:53.299> versus

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
more money for some organic foods versus

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.339 
more money for some organic foods versus
non-organic<00:02:53.810> foods<00:02:54.440> or<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:55.519> know<00:02:55.639> whatever

in<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.250> long<00:02:58.430> run<00:02:58.459> usually<00:02:59.000> people<00:02:59.269> save

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
in the long run usually people save

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.690 
in the long run usually people save
money<00:02:59.720> because<00:03:00.079> they're<00:03:00.230> healthier<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.829> you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
don't get as many conditions that cost a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.610 
don't get as many conditions that cost a
lot<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.859> money<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.549> happier<00:03:05.389> happier<00:03:06.049> yes
