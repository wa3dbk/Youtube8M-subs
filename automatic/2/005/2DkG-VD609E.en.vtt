00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.480
 Now I would like to talk about the setting of parent-child relationship 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.509
 Well , naturally I want to move together like this if there are multiple objects 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.080
 There is, but it is a make parent to use at that time 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.560
 It is setting of parent-child relationship The way is easy at first It is from one becoming child of child first 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.560
 A guy of very this middle 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:32.890
 Shift click shift if parents are children as parents and children are smaller 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:36.250
 Right-click Shift Right-click to select the line and select the children in order and say the last shift right 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.550
 Select what will be the parent with a click 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.640
 Well most recently guy you selected I think I do just remember Fu say to be a parent 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.480
 A of the Object menu is after in 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.610
 Because the collection frequency of the garden and here a set well control p is high ah 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.989
 I think you can remember with the control p 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:01.110
 It is to parent set 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:06.960
 For in so objects Yes This parent-child relationship in coming to hear one more time has been set 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:13.680
 Will move by itself towards the children but has now against now if lever Line 2 and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.950
 Children move alone If you just select and move a parent, this is how the children come 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.290
 It will be in the form of leaves 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 Masu Tei 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:27.730
 Children are alone, but if you select a parent, you will be asked for a child if you select this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.660
 It is that we can do such a movement when we come 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.630
 And why or say adapted to the way of that group mother say this 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.630
 that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.930
 It's time to do animation, and by the fact that the parent-child relationship is clear in 8 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.880
 What 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.600
 Well there are things that it is easy to layer animation 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.620
 Grasp such that Well simply all 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.510
 For example rather not it is grouped without vertical relationship 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.880
 With the renovation of the wind forms that get the grandchild for the children children against parents 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.920
 that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.700
 It is a mechanism that can be grouped, for example for children now 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.149
 Ne 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.679
 I have an animation that rotates like this, though 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.220
 That's right softening animation effort, for example, car or rather the moves while that forward rotation 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.870
 Ne 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:19.650
 Vehicle body only tire rotates that at that time in when you move 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.540
 Well of course the tire is not do to be come attached to the vehicle body 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 Emergent vehicle body is good will be rewarded to define an animation that moves relative to the parent if it's parent 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 When 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 Explain moving animations with respect to parents in another round about animation 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.060
 But 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.140
 a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 I'm with so Then move will be like this 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.220
 What 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.270
 In the case of the tires, I feel that the children are spinning 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.670
 Will be that such animation can be realized, but that this kind of wind 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 Also to realize the animation 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.799
 that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.799
 Story that setting of parent-child relationship in form that has what is called hierarchy is necessary
