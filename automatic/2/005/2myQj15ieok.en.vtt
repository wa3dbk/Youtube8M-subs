I don't like those I like the ones that
you<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.560> glue<00:02:44.799> on<00:02:45.010> because<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.450> um<00:02:47.170> file

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
you can glue on because you can um file

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.949 
you can glue on because you can um file
it<00:02:48.220> down<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.610> your<00:02:48.700> size<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.930> like

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
probably do voice overs but that's the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.810 
probably do voice overs but that's the
only<00:04:34.140> problem<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:34.800> i<00:04:34.919> don't<00:04:35.100> have<00:04:35.310> a<00:04:35.340> tripod

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.050 
only problem like i don't have a tripod
and<00:04:36.570> i<00:04:37.380> don't<00:04:37.590> have<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.770> mirror<00:04:38.190> i'm<00:04:38.400> using<00:04:38.850> like

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
and i don't have a mirror i'm using like

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.930 
and i don't have a mirror i'm using like
a<00:04:39.240> box<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:40.770> there's<00:04:41.070> no<00:04:41.250> place<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.550> put<00:04:41.880> a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
a box so there's no place to put a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.630 
a box so there's no place to put a
mirror<00:04:42.270> underneath<00:04:42.960> or<00:04:43.440> over<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.950> camera<00:04:44.400> and
