00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.070
 all provided a new video and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.900
 today it's about something again 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 namely, another of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.580
 sparks pro tips and what is the whole thing 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.289
 quite simply there are things in minecraft 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.640
 they are cool to know there are things in there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.140
 minecraft this well but there are too 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 some things in minecraft are the ones 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 just awesome a few of those 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'll have more tips in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.750
 the playlist relaxed packed 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.369
 if I forgot to write 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 otherwise and pies look that me 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.329
 I think so, too, and yes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 a few brilliant things like that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.380
 one on Easter Saturday is cool I have 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.230
 something great and how to do it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.050
 cost extremely low cost 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 drive fast with the main card 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.230
 can and the fastest route or the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.700
 as far as actually known 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 actually he has his mainka route 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.920
 ever complete with paul tracy complete 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 passes through to the stop and complex 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.230
 stand is built and that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.489
 accordingly, that is actually 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 melt water can reach a degree 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.989
 or would I agree with that? 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.789
 I think about the company going down 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 drive fast as it all goes my way 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.570
 powertrain faster is actually 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 no more 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 think again because here it comes per 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 Tip, people in swimming trunks always believe that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.049
 is especially if this then the 1 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.869
 Latch function activates when you use it often 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 In any case, the ship pushes the hood 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.900
 do 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 Oh yes, I'll show you just like that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 faster and a lot more 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 I can go faster again 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.630
 another way and you see 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 here are normal rails because they are 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 This is normal rails at that time with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 the quicker it goes with it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.770
 portraits but that is often cheap 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.820
 but it is so I have of the second 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 spencer a law one to the left 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.299
 Show then show right if I am now 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.909
 will regret that two michael spence 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.020
 on the track at the same time 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.700
 drive off let's see what happens 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.180
 Please come that goes bad until the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.829
 no longer works 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.630
 Of course that is now a straight 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.520
 a little bit slow the time it's seen 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 is in the worst boost that is now 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 because I sat back in there but 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 as soon as a player is decomposed we 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.110
 see that also goes on and on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 not going along caution while there quite 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 short off so the left one strictly 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.909
 a bit clever board like that to build 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.829
 but also for now but only very briefly 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.750
 the demonstration if a player is in it 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.619
 That's the way my art is in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.530
 stone 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.170
 Press r5 as precious as the update 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.010
 the abgb but something from ismaik is one 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.069
 a little bit flung out 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.560
 yes but that is planned so exceptionally 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.830
 break down what to take and the whole still 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.569
 let's show that is extremely extreme 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 So I could be here theoretically 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.040
 actually there 1 3 sentences as well 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 given small lead and so 8 and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640
 comes soon overcame cold until the 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.280
 attack 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 hook on it patrick kassandra yes so runs 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.890
 that and that is just saying that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.120
 prototype of the machine a bit 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.680
 placed critically and also normal 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.209
 The costs seem to be more heated 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.900
 to accelerate the whole thing a bit 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.790
 should make faster 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 how is this going on? 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.780
 again piece of the track from build 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.329
 First of all, we need a small one first 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.829
 little space so you see I already have 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.230
 such a small second still 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.670
 to be drawn to follow now 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.780
 make sure I take care of him 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.760
 always make such a small bow always 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.530
 facing down what we need from 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.190
 For a very simple reason, if 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.799
 a kart from one rail to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.540
 that if a my card from a rail 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.099
 goes on another rail and the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.040
 track is card merkur becomes zum 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.660
 For example, then jumps that means more 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.609
 the other china as it thereon 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.840
 drives and that we use here in 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.290
 so just a little bit 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.269
 because that's the whole story 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.430
 why it works that way at all 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.900
 and that's why mike krÃ¼ger can be here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.099
 jump jump jump instead of creating 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 drive by drive drive drive 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.940
 but it is not really that in itself 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.319
 bug made so smart because if you 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.549
 mean jump on the rails is 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.799
 push then jump is also in 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.329
 Wandhofen locks in just as functionally 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.040
 we let ourselves be derailed for a short time 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.480
 and at the same time catch up yes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.669
 and how the board follows and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.750
 my route up a track and we 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.400
 must always seemed curves this 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.989
 get that tricky though 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.669
 you from a curve because the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.609
 aubergine connects to the lower one 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.900
 substructure upper we also dismantle and 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.819
 put new connects 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.430
 preferred with the blog below 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.879
 Interestingly, break down and rebuild 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.859
 set dismantle ab 9 sets break down dismantling 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.019
 Do not break again 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.220
 dismantle but reset and so on 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.180
 it's pretty simple that way 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.699
 actually 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.870
 No big effort is pretty quick and 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.729
 build zack away and then I have here 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.019
 until the stop the route through 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.320
 Buildings can be made as far as you can 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.630
 would like to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.800
 and then you just go off like anything else 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.850
 I drive that really hard on 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.410
 every case a prototype what do you think 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.139
 of which I hope the idea is good 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.850
 should not grow because he complains 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:39.750
 So I'll go shopping again shortly 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:41.789
 is projection then I would say say 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.889
 In the next video, we'll be up for it 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.930
 watch if that my company deep and 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.930
 cool and see you soon bye
