you<00:01:35.610> replied<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.689> took<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.900> down

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you replied to it but you took it down

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
you replied to it but you took it down
because<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:37.979> no<00:01:38.130> longer<00:01:38.400> relevant<00:01:38.520> due<00:01:38.880> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
because it was no longer relevant due to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.350 
because it was no longer relevant due to
the<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.549> again<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the time so here we are again and I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.819 
the time so here we are again and I
guess<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.290> speak<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
guess this time you can speak on it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
guess this time you can speak on it
again<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.030> don't<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:47.549> say<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.030> many

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
again so I don't know you say that many

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
again so I don't know you say that many
shouldn't<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> take<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> test<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
shouldn't have to take the test and the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.810 
shouldn't have to take the test and the
fight<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.740> disappear<00:01:52.740> mana<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.610> back
