00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.930
 to 80 grams of butter ointment and that 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.090
 a sugar tablespoon 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.770
 let's add the almonds 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.570
 majorities meters while also not 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.890
 you have almonds that we are doing very well 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.450
 combination with the waves all with the 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.840
 order is making a point routes to your 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.840
 final 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.110
 i 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.130
 careful and then the almonds 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.780
 chopped we add a little egg that goes to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.879
 combine in the cooking and will do that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.010
 you buy the stuffing with the almonds 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.809
 also 5 what I'm going to add now 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 in the cut 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.600
 an extra and now what we see is a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.470
 spoonful well filled with flour 40 with 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.630
 more for inside 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.500
 they were either this and we're going to put it in 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.260
 the sea 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 in the most advanced 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:15.030
 of 12 minutes with a little weight 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:20.270
 up cheap ground almonds and the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.270
 true that no 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.670
 because they are going to touch a little on the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.439
 cooking 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.439
 about 40 minutes they were 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.650
 because I like to be a little more 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.020
 people 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.880
 when the discomfort shells that a 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.300
 rich poor will have but less strong with 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.890
 spend on incendiary things and more 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.280
 pronounced and I like how it looks 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.820
 conquest of this almond filling 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.490
 about this we have a candle and cut to 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.530
 we both put the raw here up 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.530
 then direct 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.050
 we put all of us down here 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.250
 all right 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.250
 calabrese style 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.320
 somewhere in the vault 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.470
 pig like me 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.599
 you will get many more successes to the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.920
 list is declared in the creams not 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.920
 they prepare us in room 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.209
 and what we put up is a little bit 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.209
 of sugar 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.480
 in about 40 minutes as well 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.319
 that now 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.010
 gorosito in the middle 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.730
 when outgoing with this tongue 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.730
 it does not have to be 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.840
 This we can do something else 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.000
 with 40 minutes 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.160
 Carmelita obviously served to 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.160
 cut and is in a coma 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.070
 all ready but they are basic and they do not have 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.070
 that counts one thing
