00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 we always find it interesting that 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 novelty in the virtual world is when 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.750
 appears the kinect of can play videogame 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.610
 yes is the control or when it appeared in 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 other devices you climb on top 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.790
 with this floor that does everything your 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 Drive those glasses which leaves 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.730
 You master the game you turn them 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 beauty sides 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 now what's new in the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.240
 video games 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.410
 this surface that carries its 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 real movements for the virtual and real 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.769
 new 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 that is, there is a ball in the real world 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.370
 that you can control it through 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.680
 from the virtual 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.899
 Dude, I'll show you what I'm doing. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.590
 Speaking is this experience there, man. 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.480
 how cool 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.320
 on one side has an entire sensor 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 then the software identifies 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.809
 that you're there with your hand stirring 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.750
 with some device moving in front of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 censor and this sensor is transported 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 these movements 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.230
 this distance this height is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 transported into the software in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.390
 is designed with them with business 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 cubes fulfilled all the line 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.520
 vertical they have all the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.530
 the height information of your hand and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.000
 take it there then you can 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.189
 physical transported to the virtual by 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 physical again then on the virtual you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.200
 can control some real objects 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.020
 that you control either using your hand or 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.080
 controls using a basket or through 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.790
 some gadgets it inside the game 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.890
 even within the same software that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.380
 whole project is the result of research 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 calls report that is conducted by students 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.780
 teacher- led institution 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 hiroshi this is superficial take over 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 three-dimensional shapes in real time and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.549
 for this the set of cameras and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.610
 sensors maps the entire object format 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.409
 observed and identifies movements that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 are being made that in practice 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.369
 consist of changing the form sends the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 data to the computer 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.329
 it simply transform the size 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.579
 from one side to the other, she can 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
 is also to receive some things from 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.350
 software without the times it is 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.509
 show a model that shows 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.819
 it's all a surface there you put one 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.230
 software gives play and hot weather to 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.440
 you 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 want to make some changes even 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.659
 tightening it allows for many things and 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 can be done both in games and in 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.599
 face presentations is a novelty is 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.080
 logical giant you can see that the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.410
 whole machine is fulfilled and has many 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.440
 and is a very complex thing is the prototype 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.150
 very well done and will open a lot 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.069
 People still have heads of 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.049
 hit the eye already said that the hologram of 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.049
 star wars is more or less that only when 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.829
 instead of simply holograms with light 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.280
 is body holograms with very shapes 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.280
 cool
