00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
look up the slope then you can go never

a<00:01:49.320> slope<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.190> much<00:01:50.460> safer<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.630> carry<00:01:51.990> on

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
a slope it's much safer to just carry on

out<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.540> way<00:01:54.720> you'll<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.410> much<00:01:55.800> more

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
out of the way you'll be much more

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
out of the way you'll be much more

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
an erratic move it's actually more

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.050 
an erratic move it's actually more
