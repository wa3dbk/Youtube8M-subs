00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
once again the launching phase takes us

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.260 
once again the launching phase takes us
from<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.350> end<00:00:09.500> of<00:00:09.770> the<00:00:09.860> loading<00:00:10.250> phase<00:00:10.430> to<00:00:11.150> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.620 

let's<00:00:55.950> start<00:00:56.220> by<00:00:56.400> taking<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.820> look<00:00:56.940> first<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
let's start by taking a look first at a

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.350 
let's start by taking a look first at a
player's<00:00:57.960> left<00:00:58.350> arm<00:00:58.620> during<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.040> swing<00:00:59.360> since

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
player's left arm during the swing since

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.510 
player's left arm during the swing since
the<00:01:00.540> left<00:01:00.720> arm<00:01:00.990> and<00:01:01.170> shoulder<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.710> positioned

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the left arm and shoulder are positioned

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640 
the left arm and shoulder are positioned
in<00:01:02.700> front<00:01:03.060> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> left<00:01:03.570> hand<00:01:03.989> during<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
in front of the left hand during the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
in front of the left hand during the
direction<00:01:05.160> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.370> swing<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.870> during<00:01:06.870> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
direction of the swing or during the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.680 
direction of the swing or during the
direction<00:01:07.410> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> forced<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.450> left

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
direction of the forced then the left

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.960 
direction of the forced then the left
arm<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.080> shoulder<00:01:10.170> will<00:01:11.010> pull<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> bat

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
arm and shoulder will pull on the bat

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.609 
arm and shoulder will pull on the bat
handle<00:01:12.210> throughout<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> swing

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.010 

and<00:01:20.829> if<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.579> take<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.820> look<00:01:22.060> now<00:01:22.119> at<00:01:22.329> the<00:01:22.600> players

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
and if we take a look now at the players

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.770 
and if we take a look now at the players
right<00:01:23.470> arm<00:01:23.710> during<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.100> swing<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:25.390> see<00:01:25.630> that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
right arm during the swing we see that

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.270 
right arm during the swing we see that
his<00:01:25.990> right<00:01:26.320> arm<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.710> shoulder<00:01:26.829> are

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
his right arm and shoulder are

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240 
his right arm and shoulder are
positioned<00:01:28.240> behind<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.170> right<00:01:29.320> hand<00:01:29.619> during

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
positioned behind the right hand during

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.340 
positioned behind the right hand during
the<00:01:30.340> direction<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> swing<00:01:31.240> or<00:01:31.539> during<00:01:32.229> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the direction of the swing or during the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.980 
the direction of the swing or during the
direction<00:01:32.770> of<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.979> force<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.579> so<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.810> right

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
direction of the force and so the right

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.499 
direction of the force and so the right
arm<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.470> shoulder<00:01:35.560> will<00:01:36.490> push<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.330> bad

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
arm and shoulder will push on the bad

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:46.410 
arm and shoulder will push on the bad
handle<00:01:37.929> as<00:01:38.049> seen<00:01:38.679> here<00:01:38.710> throughout<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.460> swing

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.690 

okay<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.680> now<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:48.130> know<00:01:48.340> for<00:01:48.580> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
okay so now that we know for the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.969 
okay so now that we know for the
right-hand<00:01:49.150> batter<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.560> left<00:01:50.800> arm

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
right-hand batter that the left arm

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.070 
right-hand batter that the left arm
pulls<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.580> bat<00:01:51.760> handle<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.870> right

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
pulls on the bat handle and the right

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.560 
pulls on the bat handle and the right
arm<00:01:53.320> pushes<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.190> let's<00:01:54.970> define<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
arm pushes on it let's define the

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.690 
arm pushes on it let's define the
muscles<00:01:55.960> involved<00:01:56.440> in<00:01:56.590> both<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.010> these<00:01:57.310> arms

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
muscles involved in both of these arms

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300

and before we go on to the muscles of

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.110 
and before we go on to the muscles of
the<00:03:18.140> right<00:03:18.380> arm<00:03:18.620> there<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.400> one<00:03:19.910> more

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the right arm there is one more

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.150 
the right arm there is one more

important muscle group that I want to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.670 
important muscle group that I want to
mention<00:03:22.310> regarding<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.060> left<00:03:23.300> arm<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.840> that

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
mention regarding the left arm and that

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.089 
mention regarding the left arm and that
is<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.040> elbow<00:03:25.220> or<00:03:25.640> forearm<00:03:26.390> extensors<00:03:27.099> this

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
is the elbow or forearm extensors this

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.920 
is the elbow or forearm extensors this
muscle<00:03:28.580> group<00:03:28.670> doesn't<00:03:29.330> pull<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.630> arm<00:03:29.810> around

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930

during<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.470> launching<00:03:30.950> phase<00:03:31.130> like<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
during the launching phase like the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.910 
during the launching phase like the
previous<00:03:32.569> five<00:03:32.780> muscles<00:03:33.050> that<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.440> discussed

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
previous five muscles that we discussed

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.180 
previous five muscles that we discussed
but<00:03:34.910> rather<00:03:35.090> they<00:03:35.840> help<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.319> extend<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.980> left

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
but rather they help to extend the left

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.400 
but rather they help to extend the left
elbow<00:03:37.400> or<00:03:38.180> left<00:03:38.599> forearm<00:03:38.959> at<00:03:39.319> contact

specifically the elbow extensors are the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.780 
specifically the elbow extensors are the
triceps<00:03:45.200> muscle<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:46.220> anconeus<00:03:46.640> muscle

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
triceps muscle and the anconeus muscle

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.020 
triceps muscle and the anconeus muscle
and<00:03:47.650> these<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.860> be<00:03:48.950> seen<00:03:49.130> more<00:03:49.160> clearly<00:03:49.370> in
