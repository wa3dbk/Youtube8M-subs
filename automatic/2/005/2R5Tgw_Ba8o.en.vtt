00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
wondering on how to get them until I

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
wondering on how to get them until I
found<00:00:39.840> three<00:00:40.710> ways<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:42.350> ok<00:00:43.350> here's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
found three ways to get them ok here's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.490 
found three ways to get them ok here's
the<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.010> way<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.690> draw<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> vehicle

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the first way you can draw the vehicle

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.260 
the first way you can draw the vehicle
fast<00:00:46.890> speeds<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> last<00:00:48.809> second

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
fast speeds and just at the last second

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.220 
fast speeds and just at the last second
done<00:00:51.980> drop<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.190> vehicle<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> you'll<00:00:54.719> stand

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
done drop your vehicle and you'll stand

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
done drop your vehicle and you'll stand
on<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> little<00:00:56.070> ledge<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
on that little ledge and then if you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
on that little ledge and then if you
come<00:00:57.960> you'll<00:00:58.170> end<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.070> metal

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
come you'll end up on this little metal

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.529 
come you'll end up on this little metal
pipe<00:01:00.289> now<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> keep<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.250> you'll

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
pipe now if you keep going up you'll

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
pipe now if you keep going up you'll
you'll<00:01:03.539> eventually<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.049> both<00:01:04.409> tell<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you'll eventually see both tell you that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.490 
you'll eventually see both tell you that
later<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.720> here's<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> other<00:01:07.020> way<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
later and here's the other way you can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
do it you can use light Jack light to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
do it you can use light Jack light to
get<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.340> too<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.600> here's<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.229> but

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you jump you jump you do a double jump

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
you jump you jump you do a double jump
and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.460> kick<00:01:56.790> otherwise<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.750> press<00:01:57.990> circle

got<00:03:17.790> all<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.150> them<00:03:18.270> but<00:03:19.670> now<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.120> could<00:03:21.270> see

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
got all of them but now if you could see

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.170 
got all of them but now if you could see
that<00:03:21.930> there<00:03:22.170> are<00:03:22.230> some<00:03:22.530> wires<00:03:22.880> pointing<00:03:23.880> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
that there are some wires pointing to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180 
that there are some wires pointing to
that<00:03:24.300> little<00:03:24.570> towel<00:03:24.840> over<00:03:25.170> there<00:03:25.380> yeah<00:03:26.010> I

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that little towel over there yeah I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.010 
that little towel over there yeah I
don't<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.490> why<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.760> happens<00:03:27.450> but<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.750> think

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
don't know why that happens but I think

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.420 
don't know why that happens but I think
that's<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:28.950> want<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.190> lot<00:03:29.400> more

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
