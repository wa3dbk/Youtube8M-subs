 1 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.080
 children's education by promoting meaningful experiences of 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.739
 learning of the language through a work with oral and written language 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.630
 is one of the spaces for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.370
 communication and expression 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.480
 as well as access to the world of children 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 mine 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.960
 ansa 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 this version is related to the gradual development of 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.650
 associated with the four basic language skills 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.850
 talk listen 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 and write 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.250
 learn a language 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.670
 it is not only learning words but also seeing their cultural meanings 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.460
 and with them the ways in which the people of their socio-cultural environment 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.270
 understand interpret 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.859
 and represent reality &amp; quot; to &amp; quot; 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.849
 She did not answer, now comes this school or 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 Can be 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.439
 oral and written language learning 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.030
 an important element for children to increase their chances of 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.849
 insertion and participation in the various social practices 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.510
 since the work with the language is constituted 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.709
 in one of the basic axes of early childhood education 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 given its importance for the formation of the subject 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.189
 for interaction with other people to guide the actions of the 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.289
 children 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.019
 for building much knowledge 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 and for the development of thought 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.130
 thus 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.359
 we can ask ourselves 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.719
 what is the use of 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.349
 how babies communicate 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.779
 how children's language evolves over the period from 18 months to 6 years 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.119
 what is ally 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.919
 what are the main differences between the language he shows we write and here 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.959
 we hear and we speak 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 how the child builds the written language 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.809
 these many other questions will be answered here in this video course 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:14.479
 in which we will be exposing theoretical foundations that will help in the 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.899
 those who are involved in the process of educating 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.339
 children's education institutions
