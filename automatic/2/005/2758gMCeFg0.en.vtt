 not the usual perspective today I finally 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 Received a welcome parcel from 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 user reached niro we are with him 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 agreed to exchange a number of knives 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.680
 Well, in general, and he and I were waiting for these 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 he hasn't received his parcel yet 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 I got my waiting for more than a month like 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.890
 I would like that 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 Mail because Oleg on time sent 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 there for just a few days she 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.270
 reached the distribution center 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 passed customs and a month just lay like 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.460
 if I am waiting for their shipment to sleep in the blood 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 Generally, I received the coveted envelope 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 so I didn’t even wait for the evening 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 to normal it all take off normal 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.980
 conditions like evil I forgot my 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.570
 paramilitary house first thought up and rye 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.080
 then just forgot so here we are now 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 let's open 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 What kind of non-standard knife so still I 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.409
 read that here is Oleg there is a knife inside 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.990
 should be he said he would be here 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.790
 some kind of surprise and here i see that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 dishonest newspaper keychain and parts for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 multitool what are the parts for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 I suspect that the men of the newspaper with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.829
 key fob is a mystery to me so i think that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.829
 I'm here on a neat sing 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:02:02.930
 so the box from spider to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:09.050
 and took off knowingly 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:14.519
 what a spider I guess it 's his 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:24.540
 wonderful and forget imagine 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:27.989

 which Oleg put in order to 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.430

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.799

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.780

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.840
