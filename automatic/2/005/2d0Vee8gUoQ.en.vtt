three things that are that cause a lot

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.069 
three things that are that cause a lot
of<00:00:20.800> stress<00:00:21.220> for<00:00:21.489> the<00:00:21.909> Orcas<00:00:22.269> in<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.599> wild<00:00:22.929> I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
mean captivity versus in the wild one

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.509 
mean captivity versus in the wild one
thing<00:00:26.169> is<00:00:26.409> that<00:00:26.649> these<00:00:26.890> are<00:00:27.069> animals<00:00:27.399> that

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
thing is that these are animals that

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.659 
thing is that these are animals that
swim<00:00:27.789> 80<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.300> 100<00:00:28.659> miles<00:00:28.899> per<00:00:29.199> day<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.589> so<00:00:30.159> no

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
swim 80 to 100 miles per day and so no

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.120 
swim 80 to 100 miles per day and so no
matter<00:00:30.789> how<00:00:31.089> big<00:00:31.479> the<00:00:31.899> tank<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.410> it's<00:00:32.829> still<00:00:33.100> a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
matter how big the tank is it's still a

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.580 
matter how big the tank is it's still a
tank<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:34.090> next<00:00:34.420> thing<00:00:34.570> is<00:00:34.630> that<00:00:35.080> these<00:00:35.380> are

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
tank the next thing is that these are

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.770 
tank the next thing is that these are
animals<00:00:35.980> that<00:00:36.040> live<00:00:36.250> highly<00:00:36.640> complex<00:00:37.180> social

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
animals that live highly complex social

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.110 
animals that live highly complex social
lives<00:00:38.200> they<00:00:38.590> have<00:00:38.770> a<00:00:39.010> part<00:00:39.400> of<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.610> brain<00:00:39.790> that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
lives they have a part of the brain that

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.440 
lives they have a part of the brain that
humans<00:00:40.660> don't<00:00:40.870> have<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:42.730> identify

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
humans don't have and they identify

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.750 
humans don't have and they identify
themselves<00:00:43.480> not<00:00:44.470> just<00:00:44.530> as<00:00:44.920> individuals<00:00:45.610> but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
themselves not just as individuals but

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.240 
themselves not just as individuals but
as<00:00:45.970> sort<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.330> part<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.900> pod<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:47.890> their

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
as sort of part of the pod so their

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.130 
as sort of part of the pod so their
social<00:00:48.700> structures<00:00:49.120> are<00:00:49.300> constantly<00:00:49.900> being

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
social structures are constantly being

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.980 
social structures are constantly being
changed<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:50.890> moved<00:00:51.520> around<00:00:51.850> all<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.420> time<00:00:52.450> by

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
changed and moved around all the time by

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.080 
changed and moved around all the time by
the<00:00:53.050> humans<00:00:53.530> they<00:00:53.920> don't<00:00:54.220> get<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.460> chance<00:00:54.760> to

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
the humans they don't get a chance to

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.380 
the humans they don't get a chance to
work<00:00:55.810> out<00:00:56.020> their<00:00:56.260> own<00:00:56.440> social<00:00:56.890> stress<00:00:57.400> amongst

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
work out their own social stress amongst

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.330 
work out their own social stress amongst
themselves<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.140> so<00:00:59.260> this<00:00:59.440> causes<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.920> lot<00:01:00.280> of

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
themselves and so this causes a lot of

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.580 
themselves and so this causes a lot of
aggression<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.420> third<00:01:01.780> thing<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.380> the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
aggression a third thing is that the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.740 
aggression a third thing is that the
animals<00:01:03.010> are<00:01:03.160> given<00:01:03.579> frozen<00:01:04.119> fish<00:01:04.420> in

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
animals are given frozen fish in

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.569 
animals are given frozen fish in
captivity<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.979> doesn't<00:01:06.250> meet<00:01:06.399> their

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
captivity and it doesn't meet their

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.669 
captivity and it doesn't meet their
nutritional<00:01:07.149> needs<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:08.020> fish<00:01:08.259> once<00:01:08.499> it's

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
nutritional needs the fish once it's

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.219 
nutritional needs the fish once it's
frozen<00:01:08.859> it<00:01:09.280> loses<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.999> good<00:01:10.329> percentage<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
frozen it loses a good percentage of the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.679 
frozen it loses a good percentage of the
of<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.950> moisture<00:01:12.369> of<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.729> water<00:01:13.030> content<00:01:13.270> and

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
of the moisture of the water content and

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.660 
of the moisture of the water content and
also<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.079> minerals<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.799> vitamins<00:01:15.189> so

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
also the minerals and the vitamins so

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.099 
also the minerals and the vitamins so
they're<00:01:15.969> chronically<00:01:16.450> stressed<00:01:16.600> just

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
they're chronically stressed just

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.440 
they're chronically stressed just
because<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.710> malnutrition<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.639> so<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.299> then

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
because of malnutrition and so and then

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.270 
because of malnutrition and so and then
also<00:01:19.630> because<00:01:20.170> they<00:01:20.319> often<00:01:20.710> get<00:01:20.859> ulcers<00:01:21.069> in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
also because they often get ulcers in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520 
also because they often get ulcers in
captivity<00:01:21.789> from<00:01:22.179> stress<00:01:22.479> held<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.079> average

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
captivity from stress held the average

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.800 
captivity from stress held the average
mortality<00:01:24.490> rate<00:01:24.670> for<00:01:24.700> captive<00:01:25.329> killer<00:01:25.569> whales

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
mortality rate for captive killer whales

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.679 
mortality rate for captive killer whales
is<00:01:26.079> 2.5<00:01:26.799> times<00:01:27.130> higher<00:01:27.399> than<00:01:27.429> it<00:01:27.819> is<00:01:27.969> for<00:01:28.299> for

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
is 2.5 times higher than it is for for

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.600 
is 2.5 times higher than it is for for
wild<00:01:28.960> killer<00:01:29.200> whales

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610

thing the next thing is you can pressure
these<00:02:12.670> places<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.540> allow<00:02:14.260> these<00:02:14.560> animals

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
to breed in captivity if these places

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.560 
to breed in captivity if these places
are<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.470> making<00:02:17.800> money<00:02:17.980> anymore<00:02:18.430> then<00:02:19.150> they

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
are not making money anymore then they

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.930 
are not making money anymore then they
will<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.959> be<00:02:20.260> phased<00:02:20.500> out<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.040> hopefully

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
will have to be phased out and hopefully

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.449 
will have to be phased out and hopefully
if<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.020> given<00:02:23.470> that<00:02:23.590> scenario<00:02:23.950> there

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
if in that given that scenario there

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.790 
if in that given that scenario there
will<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.940> move<00:02:25.360> towards<00:02:25.900> some<00:02:26.350> sort<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
will be a move towards some sort of a

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.010 
will be a move towards some sort of a
sanctuary<00:02:27.250> like<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> sea<00:02:28.270> sanctuary<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.930> they
