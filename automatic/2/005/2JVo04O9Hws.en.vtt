 [Music] 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:22.770
 [Music] 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.600
 the 6 of the shadow say no 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.540
 there are some mythical islands surrounded by 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.660
 ghosts and specters tales for 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.860
 scare the kids but I know the truth 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.620
 I've been there as soon as I put my foot 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.120
 there I knew instantly that there was something 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 weird in that place 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.960
 I also dedicated myself and sank 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.800
 severe nausea in the mouth of the stomach 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 there is no place for the living but 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.210
 I also knew deep in my 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.560
 I knew that the islands gave me the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.229
 welcome they wanted me there as they 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.810
 I went into them I saw death to 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.390
 around me 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.700
 grass trees and appearance flowers 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.399
 spooky that they wrapped with their 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.820
 terrifying glow was everything so 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.340
 quiet and also about it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.490
 I passed my hand through a sheet 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.560
 spectral that flew in the wind I did not 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.320
 there was wind 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.290
 that's when I understood that the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.380
 death was another world and that I was in 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.530
 the door of it at that time 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.170
 I listened to the song lara song 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 traveled my partner started screaming from 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.899
 terror and he fell on his knees I gave him a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.620
 hug I said I had nothing to 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:05.230
 fear 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.230
 that I was going to go to a better place 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.660
 and I will take you all to a better place
