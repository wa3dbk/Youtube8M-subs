 Uh, and continue doing the work week more now stuffing 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:23.720
 I picked it up and did not give it to the ground. It's been just a week. 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:30.439
 I'm sorry, and now I'm thinking of taking a stronger Casseroll without any special work in the future . 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:37.130
 I am sincerely sorry I had not been there for just a week like now.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.190
 U 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.560
 I have been studying the technique of ticking and have used it a lot . 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:16.810
 It is very useful because it has a big thumb and a big thumb. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:21.220
 For example, the thumb 255 W combo 1 um and also 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.420
 Sitting with knowledge using thumb turning 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 Island Sea Quiver 2 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:38.659
 It is a lot of applications in this way, so I went over it. 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:44.060
 You can do a lot to make a thumb. 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:48.249
 Thumb turning, then turning the index finger 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.249
 There are probably a lot of people who are not good at it. 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.520
 It's always important to catch your senses. 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:03.650
 Once the thumb turn is a new moth thumb here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.790
 Get on the axis and ride the eagle 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.700
 Here, take a shaft and say like a thumb face. 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.810
 Here we go over the axis 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.540
 This is a technique to tolerate. 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.540
 I'll turn you again 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.870
 Like this 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.870
 like this 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:35.580
 What action thumb wheel stone for absolute 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:40.840
 Thumb to thumb, do be careful what example I used in other the old days something 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.760
 This way your thumb will go down and you will not be able to lift your thumb in class 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.640
 I had someone else. 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.560
 Maybe when you practice at the beginning of the upright hold up your thumb a little bit over the top 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.590
 It may be more convenient. 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:00.010
 There are two kinds of spin thumb is that Europe would not now how to zoom 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.250
 Iteunikka are 2 sword experiments Quirks 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.280
 You've approached two of the first geolro me when available 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.540
 One will be 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.020
 If you do something with the index finger, you can easily and easily stop 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.020
 There is 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.720
 When you turn your thumb, you have to jump to another point 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.209
 to do 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.550
 Do not try to catch your fans like this when you're thumbing. 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.890
 So fans 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:37.020
 This way, I grab a little back side . 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.020
 There are 6 of these 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:45.850
 There's a chance here. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.560
 This way, you can land easily when you climb up to the top. 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.800
 Like this 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.070
 And now I'll learn when to turn. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.100
 Thumb Sully said that this is quite 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.340
 It takes a little more time 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:07.240
 4 pieces of quick spicy ones 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.680
 Everyone learned this one hour and a half for the first time . 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.750
 I got caught. 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.440
 But I think you can learn faster than I do. 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 How to 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.980
 now 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.660
 Here's a thumb to talk back to the bike 6 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.660
 He also rides his thumb 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.650
 This is the technology 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.190
 Said method turned thumb here Fan Fan 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.949
 The thumb will leave you and stop 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.290
 Push this way to make this posture 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:48.120
 At first, making bigger is important. 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.990
 It will. 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:56.250
 When you tighten like this, 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:01.860
 And leave the stops and leave them as they are. 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:05.499
 Cub as also leave the annular do this recording and right index 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.680
 If you do this, 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.680
 All the way back 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:18.870
 I do bullseye back so now beginning r from practice so knock off 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.870
 Damie is okay to drop from 6 and is a practice 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:23.190
 5 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.190
 5 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.100
 Oh, like this one , 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:39.070
 I must have passed. 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:46.330
 After that, sleep is an exercise, but at first, 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:48.340
 I have to catch it, but once I'm in the position to learn, 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.460
 Grabbing 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:56.990
 Well something like this to stop finger 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.990
 At first, 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.810
 Third to fourth finger 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:13.090
 And as I said before, if you put your thumb on top, 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.820
 It 'll be fine. 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.900
 Bitterants fluff like this 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:25.140
 I have a thumb in the past just like this 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.140
 I did the practice of catching and setting up 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.230
 Now, because necessary skills in ttokttakyi then this means learning lessons 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.880
 You have to cross it 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:41.180
 The technology now rather than later even learn gradually as more than drawing Ong 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.760
 Definitely a good learning beyond hasineunge 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.970
 So what now 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:52.730
 Turn your thumb, I'll finish your thumb. 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:59.300
 Well, it's a question or something related to a filter. 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:07:05.470
 I was wondering what the same thing is, the same barbecue 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.460
 Anyway, if you leave it as a cliche, 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:13.240
 I will answer 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.240
 I'll have a fan-like lecture over that . Thank you.
