is<00:04:48.590> something<00:04:48.830> else<00:04:48.889> too<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.340> change<00:04:49.669> who

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
is something else too you can change who

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.439 
is something else too you can change who
you<00:04:50.210> are

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
even to barbarians or city-states you

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.029 
even to barbarians or city-states you
show<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.680> no<00:04:55.460> so<00:04:55.669> far<00:04:55.699> these<00:04:56.120> no<00:04:57.039> ok

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
show that no so far these no ok

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.650 
show that no so far these no ok
barbarians<00:04:58.639> actually<00:04:58.910> do<00:04:59.030> have<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> tech<00:04:59.449> tree

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
barbarians actually do have a tech tree

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.080 
barbarians actually do have a tech tree
is<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:01.070> makes<00:05:01.370> sense<00:05:01.550> with<00:05:01.669> getting<00:05:01.940> better

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
is that makes sense with getting better

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.170 
is that makes sense with getting better
units<00:05:03.970> huh<00:05:06.070> I'm<00:05:07.070> gonna<00:05:07.400> have<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.699> whole<00:05:07.940> I

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
units huh I'm gonna have that whole I

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.790 
units huh I'm gonna have that whole I
have<00:05:08.300> developed<00:05:08.780> such<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> way<00:05:09.139> they<00:05:09.199> all<00:05:09.560> don't

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
have developed such a way they all don't

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.580 
have developed such a way they all don't
oh<00:05:10.310> wait<00:05:11.210> now<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.389> think<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.690> changes<00:05:12.380> if<00:05:12.560> you

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
oh wait now I think that changes if you

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.170 
oh wait now I think that changes if you
let<00:05:13.070> go<00:05:13.310> yeah<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.970> hides<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:15.560> cities

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
let go yeah it hides it for cities
