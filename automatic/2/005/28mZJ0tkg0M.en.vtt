pretty<00:00:27.099> good<00:00:27.250> fight<00:00:27.520> I<00:00:27.759> thought<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.509> first

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
pretty good fight I thought the first

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.990 
pretty good fight I thought the first
half<00:00:29.469> was<00:00:29.770> pretty<00:00:30.009> entertaining<00:00:30.129> the<00:00:30.640> second

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
half was pretty entertaining the second

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.810 
half was pretty entertaining the second
half<00:00:31.119> we<00:00:31.300> kind<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.349> slowed<00:00:33.129> down<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.550> leg<00:00:33.700> the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
half we kind of slowed down the leg the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.760 
half we kind of slowed down the leg the
last<00:00:34.030> three<00:00:34.270> run<00:00:34.390> slow<00:00:34.660> down<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> bit<00:00:34.989> but<00:00:35.620> it's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
last three run slow down a bit but it's

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.380 
last three run slow down a bit but it's
a<00:00:35.860> pretty<00:00:35.980> entertaining<00:00:36.399> fighter<00:00:36.760> enjoyed<00:00:37.210> it

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
a pretty entertaining fighter enjoyed it

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.170 
like digg only gave one round two
Cormier<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:47.980> thought<00:00:48.280> Cormier<00:00:48.610> one<00:00:48.850> like<00:00:49.000> two

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
Cormier I thought Cormier one like two

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.750 
Cormier I thought Cormier one like two
rounds<00:00:49.540> but<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.530> could<00:00:50.980> see<00:00:51.160> how<00:00:51.460> they<00:00:51.640> could

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
rounds but I could see how they could

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.970 
rounds but I could see how they could
score<00:00:52.090> it<00:00:52.180> for<00:00:52.390> four<00:00:52.660> just<00:00:53.110> giving<00:00:53.500> one<00:00:53.710> round

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
score it for four just giving one round

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.319 
score it for four just giving one round
to<00:00:54.160> call<00:00:54.340> me<00:00:54.489> because<00:00:54.790> I<00:00:54.820> thought<00:00:55.000> it<00:00:55.059> was<00:00:55.180> like

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
to call me because I thought it was like

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.720 
to call me because I thought it was like
one<00:00:55.540> round<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.960> was<00:00:56.050> close<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.730> could

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
one round that was close I could

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.430 
one round that was close I could
possibly<00:00:58.090> go<00:00:58.270> either<00:00:58.420> way<00:00:58.510> well<00:00:59.110> what<00:00:59.320> the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
possibly go either way well what the

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.569 
possibly go either way well what the
hell<00:00:59.559> do<00:00:59.680> I<00:00:59.770> know<00:00:59.800> I<00:01:00.040> don't<00:01:00.250> really<00:01:00.340> know<00:01:00.520> how

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
hell do I know I don't really know how

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.600 
hell do I know I don't really know how
to<00:01:00.700> score<00:01:01.050> MMA<00:01:02.050> fights<00:01:02.320> but<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:03.070> me<00:01:03.219> I<00:01:03.250> thought

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
to score MMA fights but to me I thought

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.700 
to score MMA fights but to me I thought
they<00:01:03.670> were<00:01:03.850> like<00:01:04.000> two<00:01:04.210> rounds<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.689> you<00:01:05.560> can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
they were like two rounds that you can

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.499 
they were like two rounds that you can
give<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:05.979> Cormier<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.790> think<00:01:07.060> that's<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.360> most

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
give to Cormier I think that's the most

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.120 
give to Cormier I think that's the most
rounds<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.020> can<00:01:08.049> give<00:01:08.350> them<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.770> it's

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
rounds you can give them it's it's

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.359 
rounds you can give them it's it's
definitely<00:01:09.759> when<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.240> win<00:01:10.719> for<00:01:10.960> Jon<00:01:11.110> Jones<00:01:11.439> he

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
definitely when a win for Jon Jones he

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.099 
definitely when a win for Jon Jones he
controlled<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.999> pace<00:01:13.209> for<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.630> most<00:01:13.810> part<00:01:13.990> of

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
controlled the pace for the most part of

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.840 
controlled the pace for the most part of
the<00:01:14.170> fight<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.909> controlled<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:16.959> clinch<00:01:17.319> um<00:01:17.850> he

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
the fight he controlled the clinch um he

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.179 
the fight he controlled the clinch um he
was<00:01:18.880> able<00:01:19.179> to<00:01:19.359> take<00:01:19.569> down<00:01:19.780> Cormier<00:01:20.319> a<00:01:20.709> few

in<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.740> last<00:01:44.770> two<00:01:45.130> rounds<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.549> i<00:01:45.639> think

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
in the last two rounds and i think

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.489 
in the last two rounds and i think
that's<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.029> main<00:01:46.149> reason<00:01:46.209> why<00:01:46.659> he<00:01:46.779> lost<00:01:46.929> he

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
that's the main reason why he lost he

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.899 
that's the main reason why he lost he
tired<00:01:47.770> down<00:01:47.979> they<00:01:48.249> couldn't<00:01:48.549> really<00:01:48.700> do<00:01:48.880> much

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
tired down they couldn't really do much

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.899 
tired down they couldn't really do much

that<00:02:06.039> much<00:02:06.249> with<00:02:06.489> MMA<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.149> thought<00:02:07.569> nobody<00:02:07.929> can

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
that much with MMA I thought nobody can

that much with MMA I thought nobody can
really<00:02:08.259> beat<00:02:08.500> him<00:02:08.649> right<00:02:08.770> now<00:02:08.800> listen<00:02:09.220> not

really beat him right now listen not
that<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.729> like<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.360> from<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.200> fighters<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.620> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that I like I from the fighters that I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.400 
that I like I from the fighters that I
know<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:12.010> don't<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.459> anyone<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.880> beat<00:02:13.060> him<00:02:13.410> I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
know I don't think anyone can beat him I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.410 
know I don't think anyone can beat him I
thought<00:02:14.890> Cormier<00:02:15.459> had<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.849> best<00:02:16.030> chance<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
thought Cormier had the best chance of

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.800 
thought Cormier had the best chance of
doing<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.990> he<00:02:17.350> he<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:18.370> failed<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.500> two

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
doing it and he he have failed to two

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.740 
doing it and he he have failed to two
accomplished<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.510> i

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
accomplished it and it is what it is i

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.710 
accomplished it and it is what it is i
guess<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.760> yet<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> ending<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:26.660> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
guess and yet the ending like the way to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.290 
guess and yet the ending like the way to
fight<00:02:27.020> ended<00:02:27.380> like<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:28.010> was<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.730> wasn't<00:02:28.940> good

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
guess like there was some punches after

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.640 
guess like there was some punches after
the<00:02:35.780> bell<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:37.610> guys<00:02:37.849> didn't<00:02:38.180> really<00:02:38.650> check

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the bell what guys didn't really check

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.020 
the bell what guys didn't really check
it<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:39.950> after<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.459> fight<00:02:40.700> oh<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:42.880> yeah<00:02:43.880> it's
