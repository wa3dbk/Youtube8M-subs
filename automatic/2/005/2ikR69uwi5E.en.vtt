00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.280 

first<00:00:23.460> off<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> use<00:00:24.690> some<00:00:24.900> liquid

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
first off I'm going to use some liquid

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.010 
first off I'm going to use some liquid
latex<00:00:25.530> to<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> scarred<00:00:26.730> cuts<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.750> using

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
latex to make the scarred cuts I'm using

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.950 
latex to make the scarred cuts I'm using
a<00:00:28.230> toothpick<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.890> apply<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.960> suggest

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
a toothpick to apply it with I suggest

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.140 
a toothpick to apply it with I suggest
you<00:00:31.110> take<00:00:31.290> your<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.010> this<00:00:32.130> step<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
you take your time for this step so that

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.380 
you take your time for this step so that
you<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.690> create<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.440> thin<00:00:34.770> lines<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:36.090> lines

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you can create very thin lines my lines

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.689 
you can create very thin lines my lines
won't<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> end<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.550> were

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
won't at then in the end so if I were

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.939 
won't at then in the end so if I were
doing<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.150> for<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.449> film<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.170> example<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
doing this for a film for example I

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.210 
doing this for a film for example I
would<00:00:41.430> work<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.330> slower<00:00:42.830> if<00:00:43.830> you<00:00:44.070> are

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
would work a lot slower if you are

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.369 
would work a lot slower if you are
working<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.850> yourself<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.720> also<00:00:45.870> try<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
working on yourself you can also try to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
working on yourself you can also try to
use<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.980> needle<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.760> even<00:00:48.030> thinner<00:00:48.360> lines<00:00:48.690> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
use a needle for even thinner lines I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.799 
use a needle for even thinner lines I
didn't<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.580> this<00:00:50.730> tutorial<00:00:50.970> because

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
didn't use one in this tutorial because

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.570 
didn't use one in this tutorial because
I<00:00:51.840> normally<00:00:52.320> wouldn't<00:00:52.590> suggest<00:00:52.800> using

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
I normally wouldn't suggest using

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.729 
I normally wouldn't suggest using
needles<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.239> skin<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
needles on your skin but if you are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
needles on your skin but if you are
working<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.370> yourself<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.210> obviously

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
working on yourself you can obviously

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
working on yourself you can obviously
feel<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.290> pressure<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.010> needle<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.550> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
feel the pressure of the needle and you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:11.990 
feel the pressure of the needle and you
will<00:01:00.300> most<00:01:00.540> likely<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:01.350> stab<00:01:01.800> yourself

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:27.370 

you

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.140 

so<00:01:28.380> while<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.680> latex<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.280> drying<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.760> turning

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
so while our latex is drying and turning

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.600 
so while our latex is drying and turning
translucid<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.320> dries<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:32.190> going<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
translucid as it dries I'm going to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
translucid as it dries I'm going to
apply<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:33.180> fresh<00:01:33.480> cuts<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.380> rigid

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
apply some fresh cuts with some rigid

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.310 
apply some fresh cuts with some rigid
collodion<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> collodion<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.690> just<00:01:36.990> showed

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
collodion the collodion I just showed

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.950 
collodion the collodion I just showed
has<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.620> red<00:01:37.920> coloring<00:01:38.490> added<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.360> rarely

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
has a red coloring added to it I rarely

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.350 
has a red coloring added to it I rarely
use<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.560> one<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.580> tutorial<00:01:41.760> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
use this one but for this tutorial it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.520 
use this one but for this tutorial it
works<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.900> really<00:01:43.200> well

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
works out really well

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
works out really well
you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.400> also<00:01:44.580> use<00:01:44.970> normal<00:01:45.450> rigid<00:01:45.780> collodion

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
you can also use normal rigid collodion

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.300 
you can also use normal rigid collodion
of<00:01:46.440> course<00:01:47.180> I'm<00:01:48.180> using<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.260> toothpick<00:01:49.500> again<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of course I'm using a toothpick again to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
of course I'm using a toothpick again to
apply<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> collodion<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.930> collodion<00:01:52.229> does

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
apply the collodion the collodion does

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.650 
apply the collodion the collodion does
shrink<00:01:53.160> so<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.700> worry<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.210> line<00:01:54.390> looks

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
shrink so don't worry if your line looks

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.680 
shrink so don't worry if your line looks
a<00:01:54.780> bit<00:01:54.960> too<00:01:55.170> thick<00:01:55.580> we're<00:01:56.580> working<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.210> latex

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
a bit too thick we're working with latex

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.840 
a bit too thick we're working with latex
or<00:01:57.960> collodion<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.280> some<00:01:59.520> product

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
or collodion you can get some product

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.690 
or collodion you can get some product
buildup<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.660> your<00:02:01.050> toothpick<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.280> wipe<00:02:02.490> off

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
buildup on your toothpick so wipe off

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.820 
buildup on your toothpick so wipe off
the<00:02:02.820> excess<00:02:03.150> product<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.780> between<00:02:04.170> uses<00:02:04.619> or

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
the excess product in between uses or

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:42.160 
the excess product in between uses or
just<00:02:05.610> take<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> new<00:02:06.090> toothpick

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.930 

take<00:02:43.170> some<00:02:43.379> bright<00:02:43.620> red<00:02:43.650> greasepaint<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
take some bright red greasepaint and a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.330 
take some bright red greasepaint and a
soft<00:02:45.209> brush<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.650> showing<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.129> on

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
soft brush I'm not showing this on

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.369 
soft brush I'm not showing this on
camera<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.120> wiping<00:02:48.540> off<00:02:48.720> most<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.230> the

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
camera but I'm wiping off most of the

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.160 
camera but I'm wiping off most of the
paint<00:02:49.650> onto<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.340> hand<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> very

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
paint onto my hand so that there is very

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.740 
paint onto my hand so that there is very
little<00:02:52.500> paint<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.099> my<00:02:53.340> brush<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.940> would<00:02:54.450> then

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
little paint on my brush I would then

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.809 
little paint on my brush I would then
apply<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.680> cuts<00:02:55.950> using<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.550> stippling

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
apply it on the cuts using a stippling

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.990 
apply it on the cuts using a stippling
motion<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:58.560> step<00:02:58.860> really<00:02:59.280> helps<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.819> make

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
motion this step really helps to make

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.559 
motion this step really helps to make
the<00:03:00.030> cuts<00:03:00.330> look<00:03:00.660> more<00:03:01.050> real

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
the cuts look more real

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:33.170 
the cuts look more real
you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.479 

another<00:03:34.140> thing<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:34.860> helps<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> make

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
another thing that really helps to make

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.670 
another thing that really helps to make
it<00:03:35.819> look<00:03:35.939> more<00:03:35.970> real<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.659> to<00:03:37.110> apply<00:03:37.409> some

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
it look more real is to apply some

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.119 
it look more real is to apply some
translucent<00:03:38.220> powder<00:03:38.549> on<00:03:39.060> top<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.629> scars

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
translucent powder on top of the scars

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.220 
translucent powder on top of the scars
this<00:03:41.129> takes<00:03:41.430> away<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.790> shine<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.329> hide<00:03:42.900> some

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
this takes away the shine and hide some

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:55.460 
this takes away the shine and hide some
of<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.709> redness<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:53.840> have<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:54.959> product

of the redness I have this product

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.470 
of the redness I have this product
called<00:03:55.829> crusty<00:03:56.370> blood<00:03:56.579> which<00:03:56.879> I<00:03:57.060> rarely<00:03:57.299> use

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
called crusty blood which I rarely use

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.809

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
because I'm not a big fan of the color

use<00:04:08.459> some<00:04:08.700> other<00:04:08.909> kind<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.480> blood<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:10.349> just

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
use some other kind of blood but just

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.680 
use some other kind of blood but just
some<00:04:10.739> grease<00:04:11.040> paint<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.639> add<00:04:11.790> more<00:04:12.060> color<00:04:12.329> to

I<00:04:47.350> then<00:04:48.350> decided<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:49.070> add<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> little<00:04:49.280> bit<00:04:49.550> more

I then decided to add a little bit more
redness<00:04:50.300> around<00:04:50.540> fresh<00:04:51.110> cuts<00:04:51.470> with<00:04:52.130> the
