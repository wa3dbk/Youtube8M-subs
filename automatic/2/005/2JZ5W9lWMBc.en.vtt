to remember that the only thing that

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410 
to remember that the only thing that
really<00:00:13.410> matters<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.370> computer<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
really matters to the computer is a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.840 
really matters to the computer is a
series<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> numbers<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:17.100> are<00:00:17.220> called<00:00:17.430> an<00:00:17.550> IP

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
series of numbers that are called an IP

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810 
series of numbers that are called an IP
address<00:00:18.529> now<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> internet<00:00:20.189> world<00:00:20.430> these

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
address now in the internet world these

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
address now in the internet world these
IP<00:00:21.119> addresses<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:22.080> used<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.590> tie<00:00:22.800> computers

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
IP addresses are used to tie computers

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
IP addresses are used to tie computers
together<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.720> identify<00:00:25.470> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
together and that's how you identify a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.310 
together and that's how you identify a
computer<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.699> Internet<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> domain

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
computer on the Internet what a domain

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.500 
computer on the Internet what a domain
name<00:00:28.349> does<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.130> basically<00:00:29.760> make<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.269> IP

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
name does is basically make that IP

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.530 
name does is basically make that IP
address<00:00:30.800> easier<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.070> remember<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.239> instead<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
address easier to remember so instead of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.389 
address easier to remember so instead of
remembering<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.350> whole<00:00:34.680> bunch<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.070> numbers

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
remembering a whole bunch of numbers

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.610 
remembering a whole bunch of numbers
it's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> sequence<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.329> four<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.170> could<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.500> up

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's a sequence of four that could be up

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
it's a sequence of four that could be up
to<00:00:37.649> three<00:00:37.980> digits<00:00:38.160> apiece<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to three digits apiece you just get to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.060 
to three digits apiece you just get to
remember<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.469> simple<00:00:40.890> like

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
remember something simple like

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.299 
remember something simple like
google.com<00:00:41.489> or<00:00:42.210> yahoo.com<00:00:43.070> I'm<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.250> to

we're<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> run<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> committee<00:01:06.090> called

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we're going to run a committee called

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.170 
we're going to run a committee called
nslookup<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.530> does<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.890> domain<00:01:08.340> name<00:01:08.369> system

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
nslookup which does a domain name system

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.929 
nslookup which does a domain name system
lookup<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> basically<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
lookup and that basically is going to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
lookup and that basically is going to
return<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.780> IP<00:01:12.960> address<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.979> assigned<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
return the IP address that's assigned to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.450 
return the IP address that's assigned to
a<00:01:14.640> domain<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.330> type<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.040> example

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
a domain that we type in so for example

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
a domain that we type in so for example
let's<00:01:17.700> say<00:01:17.880> msn.com<00:01:20.420> as<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.140> we've
