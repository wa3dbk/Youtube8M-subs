00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.970
 having a good success in versions of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.860
 after dinner and with intentions to be a 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.200
 of the driving alternatives for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 nintendo 3ds 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.830
 electronic arts has compressed need for 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.440
 speed the run with a few changes 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.489
 elementals but preserving the essence 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.489
 of game adventures 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.559
 our protagonist is more a former pilot 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.000
 of racing with many low debts 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.550
 threat of death by his persecutors 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.130
 after escaping from a sunken vehicle a 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.350
 mysterious girl tells you about the run a 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.960
 clandestine race across the country with 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.430
 goal in new york 'and whose winner is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.370
 will go with a million dollars in the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.890
 pocket but the competition is very hard 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.810
 and both the police and the mafia do not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 They stop trying to throw us out of 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 track 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.399
 in the run we will have a mode 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.500
 story where we will follow the story of 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.500
 Matt in his goal of winning the big 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.650
 race and run away from their pursuers 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.540
 then we will have the challenge mode where 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 We will go back through the levels 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.130
 completed meeting requirements 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.620
 specials like passing through points 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.140
 control exceeding a speed limit 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.110
 determined to knock down a number of cars 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.410
 concrete or just get alive to the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410
 goal 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.869
 in these tests we will have to 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.690
 select vehicles from very different ranges 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
 varied among which are the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.920
 range of classic cars other than 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 exotic competition or the supercars 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.119
 finally we have the auto loft a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.250
 section of the game in which we are 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.800
 recommend different levels of the mode 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.260
 challenges that fit our style 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.510
 driving will keep record of 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 our local and online exploits 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.760
 we can see the car gallery 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.890
 unlocked and finally compete in 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.110
 multiplayer mode both in local network 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.620
 as through the wi-fi connection 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.380
 nintendo the need for speed controls 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.660
 the run are very arcade and therefore 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.660
 we need few buttons to make 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.420
 many maneuvers with the vehicle only 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.340
 we will need the accelerator the brake and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.590
 the button to activate the nitro of the car 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.770
 to go full speed through scenarios 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.350
 of variable ambience 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.510
 said nitro will be recharged as 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.750
 that we drive more recklessly and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.020
 spectacular either driving by the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.790
 lane counter a amount of time 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.000
 knocking down the police the mafia or the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.760
 rivals advancing competitors or with 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.860
 certain acrobatics within the levels 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.110
 in certain points of the plot 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.360
 we will use the touch screen to 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.189
 overcome brief mini-games with which 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.880
 continue the chapter or overcome a 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.370
 obstacle in the middle of the race 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.800
 to conclude depending on how 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 we have driven during the mission it 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.990
 will give us some experience points 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.820
 that will serve to unlock 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.680
 automatically new content like 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.240
 better vehicles or elements of 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.150
 decoration for them 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.460
 the graphic section is remarkable with a 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.370
 good frame rate with both the 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.170
 3d mode activated as disabled 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.230
 vehicles are going to spoil with the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.440
 blows and scenarios in general are 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.700
 well documented and full of elements 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.520
 preventing the feeling of monotony 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.520
 thanks to the broad geography 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.520
 U.S 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.150
 includes scenes interspersed between 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.640
 animated episodes with images 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.330
 static in the style of comics 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.400
 American what's unfortunate is that you're 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.489
 scenes are not very exciting for their 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.530
 rigidity and irregular artistic style 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.959
 only compensated in part for being 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.290
 dubbed into Castilian a detail that is 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.290
 very much appreciated 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.270
 On the other hand, it has the typical 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.160
 soundtrack that characterizes the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.360
 knicks for speed with music arrangements 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.400
 trans rock and similar genres the game 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.110
 It is very addictive thanks to its dynamics and 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.300
 the variety of situations in the way 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.759
 history and the challenges 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.500
 the multiplayer mode also lengthens the 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.680
 duration and although it is not the most stable 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 of all is very competent 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.509
 However, it does not have more incentives 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.880
 beyond the aforementioned and it will cost time 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.090
 get the best unlockables from 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.580
 Title 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.560
 need for speed the run has had a 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.460
 acceptable room inside the laptop 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.460
 3d of nintendo 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.790
 could be blamed for small errors 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.550
 in artificial intelligence the 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.350
 cameras or the loading times and it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.030
 they miss more situations 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.520
 exciting as in the version of 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.979
 desktop 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.009
 but first of all it is a serious alternative 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.530
 and very important to consider for the 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.909
 that with mario kart they do not have enough 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.909
 feeling of speed at the wheel
