shape the way obesity thinks you're
shaped<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:01.620> curve<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
shaped it will actually curve and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
shaped it will actually curve and
contour<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.420> nice<00:01:03.600> no<00:01:03.989> pressure

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
contour to you kind of nice no pressure

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.710 
contour to you kind of nice no pressure
points<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.890> more<00:01:05.070> comfortable<00:01:05.600> now<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
points much more comfortable now the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.780 
points much more comfortable now the
pockets<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.250> good<00:01:08.460> you'll

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pockets here really really good you'll

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880 
pockets here really really good you'll
actually<00:01:08.939> find<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> unzip<00:01:10.350> them

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually find that you can unzip them

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
actually find that you can unzip them
from<00:01:11.130> either<00:01:11.340> side<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> zip<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
from either side so there's a zip at the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.240 
from either side so there's a zip at the
back<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> zipper<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> front<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.189> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
back there's a zipper at the front so it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
back there's a zipper at the front so it
doesn't<00:01:14.490> matter<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> access<00:01:15.659> them

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
doesn't matter which way you access them

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
doesn't matter which way you access them
you'll<00:01:16.680> still<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> able<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> then

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you'll still be able to get in and then

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
you'll still be able to get in and then
at<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.180> area<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:20.119> inflation

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
at which area that you go for inflation

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
at which area that you go for inflation
deflation<00:01:21.540> very<00:01:22.409> standard<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.130> the

apart from that we think it's a pretty
good<00:02:18.310> BCD<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.510> got<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.900> very<00:02:20.319> very<00:02:20.560> tough

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
good BCD it's got a very very tough

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.400 
good BCD it's got a very very tough
utilitarian<00:02:21.819> feel<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:23.019> it's<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.260> some

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
utilitarian feel to it but it's got some

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.140 
utilitarian feel to it but it's got some
nice<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.680> colorations<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:24.550> well<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.000> make

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
nice little colorations as well to make

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.180 
nice little colorations as well to make
it<00:02:25.180> look<00:02:25.420> less<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> Navy<00:02:26.230> SEAL<00:02:26.500> bit<00:02:26.739> outfit
