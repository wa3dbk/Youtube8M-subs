not take off look at that look look at
that<00:02:56.990> guy's<00:02:57.230> very<00:02:57.740> soft<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> water<00:02:59.650> almost

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
that guy's very soft on the water almost

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.740 
that guy's very soft on the water almost
like<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.100> bug<00:03:01.430> they<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.850> walk<00:03:02.150> over<00:03:02.420> water

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
like that bug they just walk over water

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.430 
like that bug they just walk over water
you<00:03:02.930> know<00:03:05.650> control<00:03:06.650> right<00:03:07.010> there<00:03:08.020> coming<00:03:09.020> upon

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
you know control right there coming upon

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.550 
you know control right there coming upon
this<00:03:09.680> way

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.600 

bro<00:03:16.410> I'm<00:03:17.410> never<00:03:18.330> gonna<00:03:19.330> land<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.190> chop

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
bro I'm never gonna land it if I chop

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.020 
bro I'm never gonna land it if I chop
the<00:03:21.730> power<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.350> use<00:03:23.709> controller<00:03:24.640> with<00:03:24.880> the

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
the power and use controller with the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.660 
the power and use controller with the
rudder<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.500> little<00:03:26.830> bit<00:03:26.980> don't<00:03:27.160> overdo<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
rudder just a little bit don't overdo it

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.360 
rudder just a little bit don't overdo it
though<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:29.830> flare<00:03:31.140> bang<00:03:32.140> now<00:03:33.040> that's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
though this flare bang now that's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.250 
though this flare bang now that's
basically<00:03:33.489> dead-stick<00:03:34.360> landing<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
basically dead-stick landing so it's a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.949 
basically dead-stick landing so it's a
double<00:03:35.530> ruff<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:37.120> let's<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.600> power

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
double ruff now let's see a power

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.830 
double ruff now let's see a power
landing<00:03:38.730> which<00:03:39.730> really<00:03:40.060> power<00:03:40.390> land<00:03:40.660> it

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
landing which really power land it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.449 
landing which really power land it
should<00:03:41.050> be<00:03:41.760> nice<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.920> type<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.250> plane

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
should be nice and on this type of plane

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.160 
should be nice and on this type of plane
guys<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.850> want<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.330> do<00:03:46.450> power<00:03:46.690> landings

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
guys you want to do power landings

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.100 
guys you want to do power landings
because<00:03:47.410> they<00:03:47.530> don't<00:03:47.709> really<00:03:47.860> glide<00:03:48.220> are<00:03:48.400> good

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
because they don't really glide are good

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.210 
because they don't really glide are good
so<00:03:50.110> we're<00:03:50.290> going<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.470> control<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:51.040> altitude

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
so we're going to control the altitude

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.920 
so we're going to control the altitude
with<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.700> travel<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:54.420> could<00:03:55.420> keep<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.720> all

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
with the travel you could keep it all

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.180 
with the travel you could keep it all
going

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.610 

and<00:04:01.670> just<00:04:01.910> sit<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.330> the<00:04:02.390> water

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.210 

this<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.489> what<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.670> like<00:04:07.060> about<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.450> plane<00:04:08.220> how

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
this is what I like about this plane how

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.869 
this is what I like about this plane how
coolly<00:04:10.150> controls<00:04:10.660> on<00:04:10.840> water<00:04:11.080> rally<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.730> then

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
coolly controls on water rally and then

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.990 
coolly controls on water rally and then
it<00:04:13.030> comes<00:04:13.269> right<00:04:13.480> off<00:04:13.510> and<00:04:14.310> turns<00:04:15.310> very<00:04:15.700> tight

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
it comes right off and turns very tight

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.240 
it comes right off and turns very tight
on<00:04:16.180> water

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:41.980 

kind<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.370> some<00:04:26.520> racing<00:04:26.729> on<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.210> water

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.619 

bengis<00:04:45.590> Swami<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:47.240> flying<00:04:48.240> characteristics

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
bengis Swami the flying characteristics

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.580 
bengis Swami the flying characteristics
are<00:04:49.050> nice<00:04:49.849> because<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:51.270> those<00:04:51.569> extra<00:04:52.349> wings

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
are nice because of those extra wings

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.209 
are nice because of those extra wings
basically<00:04:53.629> of<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.110> where<00:04:55.650> other<00:04:55.949> work

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
basically of the one where other work

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.959 
basically of the one where other work
actually<00:04:56.460> makes<00:04:56.909> it<00:04:57.060> very<00:04:57.330> stable<00:04:58.789> if<00:04:59.789> you

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
actually makes it very stable if you

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.730 
actually makes it very stable if you
take<00:05:00.210> those<00:05:00.389> things<00:05:00.629> off<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.080> it

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
take those things off of it

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.869 
take those things off of it
you<00:05:02.610> better<00:05:02.969> be<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.150> good<00:05:03.210> pilot<00:05:03.629> cause<00:05:04.879> it's

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
you better be a good pilot cause it's

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.640 
you better be a good pilot cause it's
very<00:05:06.090> hard<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.569> fly<00:05:06.779> without<00:05:06.960> him<00:05:07.379> I<00:05:07.499> already

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
very hard to fly without him I already

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.730 
very hard to fly without him I already
try<00:05:08.069> it<00:05:08.129> and<00:05:08.759> it's<00:05:09.300> very<00:05:09.629> hard<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.139> fly<00:05:10.379> without

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
try it and it's very hard to fly without

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.360 
try it and it's very hard to fly without
those<00:05:11.249> things

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
those things

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.370 
those things
another<00:05:14.370> rough<00:05:14.639> landing<00:05:15.000> brother

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:26.519 

I<00:05:22.170> mean<00:05:23.170> it's<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:23.470> fly<00:05:23.980> some<00:05:24.310> of<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.490> water

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
I mean it's like fly some of the water

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:38.879 
I mean it's like fly some of the water
cool<00:05:27.099> a<00:05:27.189> level<00:05:27.459> of<00:05:27.549> up<00:05:27.669> levator<00:05:37.619> landing<00:05:38.619> again

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
cool a level of up levator landing again

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.440 
cool a level of up levator landing again
see<00:05:39.369> if<00:05:39.429> I<00:05:39.519> can<00:05:39.669> do<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:39.789> nice<00:05:39.999> one
