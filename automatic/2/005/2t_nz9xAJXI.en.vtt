00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
 Hello! I am Stas Davydov. 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.320
 Today is the eighth of October. 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.640
 And on this day a bunch of cool actors was born 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.840
 Sigourney Viver, Matt Damon, Michael Dudikov. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.940
 and if you don't remember who Michael Dudikov is. 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.100
 then turn around, maybe an American ninja EIGHT, already put a cobra under your chair. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.680
 And the first video was sent to Uzumak and Pavel. 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.320
 About him already everything on the Internet is buzzing. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.160
 It was worth the Olympic relay to reach the walls of the Kremlin. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.880
 As literally at the second participant, this happened. 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.280
 * muffled sound of music * 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.940
 Yes! 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600
 This is an Olympic flame which is not. Well, in the sense he went out. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.540
 It would seem everything, to extinguish the light, the end of the 2014 Olympiad. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.120
 But the valiant employee comes to the rescue. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 Kremlin Security Services 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:55.980
 * muffled sound of music * 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.280
 I wonder what this guard would not be a smoker? 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 Who would then light the fire ah? 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 Laser guns hidden in the Kremlin stars? 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420
 Maybe smoking and killing .. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 But here it almost saved the prestige of the Sochi Olympics. 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 The trouble is that there should be a real Olympic flame in the torch 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 lit from sunlight during a special ceremony in Greece. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 And not from the lighter zip, Kremlin FSB. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.120
 No, well, there of course they fixed everything and set it on fire with auto-like lompatki. 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.460
 But still.... 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.020
 * Muffled music * 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.940
 For your information, the Olympic torches for Sochi 2014 are made at the KRASMASH factory. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.520
 Engaged in the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.080
 According to the statement of the ORG Committee, the torch burns both under water and at a speed of 60 km per hour. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 Well, apparently Shavarsh Karapetyan ran at a speed of 61 km per hour ... and under water 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.080
 * something muffled * 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.080
 Well, be that as it may, I hope that the Olympics in Sochi will be held cheerfully 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240
 And the Russian athletes internal light will not go out. 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.000
 AND THIS IS GOOD ! 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.120
 In short, LG has recently released an advertisement about hot tsipochka and modern technology. 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.920
 Those. about a camera with chicken stabilization 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.220
 And then I remembered that I saw an advertisement for Mercedes Benz that came out 4 days before this one. 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:50.940
 *song* 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.880
 That is, hens in trend! All the cool guys 2013, do advertising with chickens! 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.140
 But Stas Davyydov, showed the world a nano rooster back in 2010 .. It will be something to tell the grandchildren. 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.340
 Russian gyroscopic stabilized nano rooster. 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.900
 For the inclination of the axis of the earth. 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.520
 So what is it that turns out, the western shpiens have stolen the Skolkovo development. 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.680
 That and look after a year two Apple will remove advertising, about chicken stabilization and call it innovation. 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.960
 Okay, the jokes aside, I donâ€™t quite understand why everyone so wanted to do vidos about chickens 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.580
 Autumn aggravation vsmysle chickens decided to ... 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.180
 Kostya, well, you found the moment to feed the chicken. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.380
 And this is good 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.180
 The third video sent by STONE HENGE 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.480
 And this is another misfortune that happened to the next grief motorists. 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.700
 The truth is not quite the trouble as you think at first. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300
 0_0 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 So what happened to the Olympic flame 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.260
 BUT! I know, 2 deputies were driving in the car ... And they had a bunch of bombonul when they watched 1 video from this release. 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.740
 Yes it is the Olympic fire which is not, I mean it went out 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.020
 Well, we actually wondered what caused such a fire. 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.560
 We conducted an independent investigation ... 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 Okay, there was no investigation, we just read the comments .. In the comments, the most competent auto mechanics are always unsubscribed. 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.320
 So ... there, too, no one surely knows anything. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.300
 Another insoluble mystery in the history of mankind has become more. 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.940
 * the theme is played from classified material * 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.100
 The bear is somewhere near ... 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.360
 And even if there was no bear, then the bearish disease of the passengers was exactly visited by the car. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.420
 Yes, probably the car from this Muzyaki caught fire. 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.500
 But how can you listen to this shit? !!! 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.120
 Well, or it was all quite simple .. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:26.220
 I will never forget that day when I hated pea supp. Smoking at the wheel that Tuesday was not a good idea ... 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.660
 AND THIS IS GOOD ! 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.760
 That's all, subscribe, like, video on the review here, and send yours and it to us to YANDEX mail. Until Friday. 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.680
 I adore inernet!
