in that's how simple it is on the top we

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.960 
in that's how simple it is on the top we
have<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.840> adapter<00:01:31.290> rack<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.920> drains<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.880> the

youth waste tank so all the fluid that
comes<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.930> hoses<00:01:37.409> goes<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> waste

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
comes out of the hoses goes in the waste

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
comes out of the hoses goes in the waste
tank<00:01:38.250> keeps<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> hose<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> neat<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.450> clean<00:01:39.689> if

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
tank keeps the hose is neat and clean if

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
tank keeps the hose is neat and clean if
you<00:01:40.439> knock<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> battery<00:01:41.400> clamps<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.000> during

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you knock the battery clamps off during

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
you knock the battery clamps off during
the<00:01:42.420> middle<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> cycle<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.100> pause

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the middle of a cycle we have a pause

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
the middle of a cycle we have a pause
feature<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.689> goes<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> pause

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
feature so it just goes in the pause
