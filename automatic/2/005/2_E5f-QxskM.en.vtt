00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 today I'll show you how it is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:11.070
 can manage a can to make 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.599
 This cute little bitch 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 you will mainly need a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.210
 can if you do not have a can yesterday 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.119
 pain goes a can if a can with the field 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 you will also need elastics of the type 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.199
 Gominho Elastic Office &amp; Goes 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 need a weight I will use here a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.429
 screw with two doors 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 I'll also use two nails ribbon 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.020
 Adhesive in line these things here can 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520
 be replaced as you will see in the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 time to set up the experiment 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.210
 To start, I'll use the nail to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 make a hole in the center of the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 down the can and another in the center of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.750
 cover there I'm going to drop that hole using 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 a philips key 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 I'll get two elastics and then I'll go 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.010
 tie my weight right in the middle of those 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.230
 elastic and it is important that this 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 weight is tied by the tip the way 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 what are you seeing here? 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.320
 the next step is to implant this weight 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 with elastics in the can 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 For this I'll get two 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 through the hole in the bottom of the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
 Okay , I'll give you a nail there. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.350
 and fasten with adhesive tape and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'll do the same thing on the cover of the lapa 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 the device is ready but for a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.259
 style issue let's give a year 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.259
 decorated this here 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 bora see this business works 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 I know you must already be full of 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.320
 theories about how this business works 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 but instead of talking like 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.740
 it works 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.900
 Let's make a can without walls in 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.470
 actual video that is happening here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.450
 inside 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.220
 for that I'll get a cd and I'll paste 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.470
 three pieces of pipe 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.480
 on the other side of the eyeball another cd 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.720
 I'm going to install a very 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.850
 similar to what I put in the can 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.150
 to finalize I give a chance with this 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.130
 spiral here and this object here is 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 practically identical to a can with 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.970
 difference that it has no walls inside 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.830
 He's wearing a rubber band, and neither do I 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.590
 weight is hanging 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:59.500
 Let's see if he behaves anyway. 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:01.810
 that it worked and now that we 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.160
 has practically a transparent can 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.730
 You can understand what happened here. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.530
 inside 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.960
 the first thing you will notice is that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.100
 cropped wheel this here will never turn 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.340
 upside down she is always 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.500
 hanging that're down and the door 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 does the door make the elastic go 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.320
 twisting while object is 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.230
 moving and as the elastic twists 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.840
 it accumulates energy, ie the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.150
 energy of the movement of that object goes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.190
 being transferred by lapse and there goes 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.900
 becoming increasingly indicated 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.360
 until a time comes when the whole 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.880
 energy of the movement is transferred by 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.080
 there chulapa is full of energy and he 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.660
 wants to go back 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.260
 the elastic that is to release this energy and 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.790
 then it begins to return to the energy of 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.800
 loop that is called potential energy 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.630
 elastic is the same energy as today 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.060
 accumulates in this nobody accumulating in the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.100
 bow to take an arrow that energy 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.519
 is being transformed back into 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.650
 move and she was fine to you 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.050
 but try the classics for you 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.780
 do kaza understand how it works 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.780
 you find in the pan in the album 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.769
 if you liked our wall without walls 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.630
 because it gives you a jewel here below 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.820
 video as I talked about potential energy 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.370
 has several manual videos of the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.990
 world that take advantage of this energy, I 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 here below that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.460
 classic sting the sling at the same time 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.010
 I say because tree island that is 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.620
 very good to take and on the other side I 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.540
 I'm going to leave a catapult made of a 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.220
 pencil is a cape because we do not 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.410
 make a live broadcast of the manual 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.690
 of the world and to this day there are many 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.970
 send instagram photos showing how it went 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.680
 done with each problem, it is only with pencils and 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.680
 of these office elastics
