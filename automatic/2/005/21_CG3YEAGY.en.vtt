right<00:00:11.870> in<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:12.200> middle<00:00:12.350> of<00:00:12.590> some<00:00:12.830> really

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
right in the middle of some really

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.430 
right in the middle of some really
dramatic<00:00:13.549> changes<00:00:14.360> that<00:00:14.600> are<00:00:14.780> occurring<00:00:14.930> in

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
dramatic changes that are occurring in

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.980 
dramatic changes that are occurring in
the<00:00:15.500> Great<00:00:15.709> Lakes<00:00:15.920> right<00:00:16.189> now<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:16.810> I've<00:00:17.810> been

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
the Great Lakes right now and I've been

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.160 
the Great Lakes right now and I've been
really<00:00:18.290> surprised<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:19.610> see<00:00:19.880> how<00:00:20.599> fast<00:00:20.960> these

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
really surprised to see how fast these

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.200 
really surprised to see how fast these
changes<00:00:21.650> are<00:00:21.770> proceeding<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.550> some<00:00:22.970> of<00:00:23.119> the

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
changes are proceeding and some of the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.109 
changes are proceeding and some of the
impacts<00:00:23.840> that<00:00:23.930> they're<00:00:24.110> having<00:00:24.290> on<00:00:24.590> the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
impacts that they're having on the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.400 
impacts that they're having on the
native<00:00:26.119> organisms<00:00:26.779> in<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.169> Great<00:00:27.380> Lakes

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
native organisms in the Great Lakes

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.470 
native organisms in the Great Lakes
these<00:00:28.099> changes<00:00:28.610> have<00:00:28.790> been<00:00:28.939> really

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
these changes have been really

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.960 
these changes have been really
accelerated<00:00:30.259> by<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.500> presence<00:00:31.250> of<00:00:31.460> invasive

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
accelerated by the presence of invasive

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.720 
accelerated by the presence of invasive
species<00:00:32.210> especially<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.620> zebra<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:34.700> quagga

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
species especially the zebra and quagga

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.340 
species especially the zebra and quagga
mussel<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.540> have<00:00:35.630> come<00:00:35.809> into<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.140> Great

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
mussel that have come into the Great

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.680 
mussel that have come into the Great
Lakes<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:37.460> most<00:00:37.790> amazing<00:00:38.270> thing<00:00:38.480> that<00:00:38.510> I've

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
Lakes the most amazing thing that I've

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.240 
Lakes the most amazing thing that I've
seen<00:00:38.899> is<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.110> I've<00:00:39.320> been<00:00:39.440> trawling<00:00:39.680> out<00:00:39.980> here

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
seen is that I've been trawling out here

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.360 
seen is that I've been trawling out here
from<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.390> know<00:00:41.480> early<00:00:41.960> 70s<00:00:42.829> all<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.190> way<00:00:43.280> up

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
from you know early 70s all the way up

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.060 
from you know early 70s all the way up
to<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:43.609> time<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.239> as<00:00:44.480> time<00:00:45.079> went<00:00:45.289> on<00:00:45.410> we<00:00:45.829> start

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
to this time so as time went on we start

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.709 
to this time so as time went on we start
picking<00:00:46.339> up<00:00:46.399> more<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:46.699> more<00:00:46.820> zebra<00:00:47.359> mussels

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
picking up more and more zebra mussels

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.169 
picking up more and more zebra mussels
in<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.899> trolls<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:48.530> then<00:00:48.920> we<00:00:49.249> saw<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.940> quagga

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
in the trolls and then we saw the quagga

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.500 
in the trolls and then we saw the quagga
mussel<00:00:50.600> come<00:00:50.749> in<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.519> about<00:00:52.519> two<00:00:52.969> thousand

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
mussel come in and about two thousand

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.150 
mussel come in and about two thousand
one<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.960> started<00:00:54.260> seeing<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.530> shift<00:00:54.589> over

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
one we started seeing a shift over

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160 
one we started seeing a shift over
toward<00:00:55.519> quagga<00:00:55.850> mussels<00:00:56.269> which<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.600> closely

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
toward quagga mussels which is a closely

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.950 
toward quagga mussels which is a closely
related<00:00:57.320> species<00:00:57.859> to<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.579> zebra<00:00:58.850> mussel<00:00:59.179> as<00:00:59.300> I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
related species to the zebra mussel as I

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.649 
related species to the zebra mussel as I
continued<00:01:00.679> trawling<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.339> started<00:01:01.999> seeing<00:01:02.300> more

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
continued trawling I started seeing more

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.920 
continued trawling I started seeing more
of<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.920> shift<00:01:04.190> toward<00:01:04.519> quagga<00:01:04.820> mussels<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.510> I

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
of a shift toward quagga mussels and I

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.510 
of a shift toward quagga mussels and I
also<00:01:06.110> started<00:01:06.409> catching<00:01:06.710> them<00:01:06.980> deeper<00:01:07.370> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
also started catching them deeper and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.969 
also started catching them deeper and
deeper<00:01:07.670> right<00:01:08.480> now<00:01:08.690> there's<00:01:08.930> probably<00:01:09.350> quagga

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
deeper right now there's probably quagga

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.460 
deeper right now there's probably quagga
mussels<00:01:10.460> across<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.090> entire<00:01:11.390> Lake<00:01:12.020> Michigan

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
mussels across the entire Lake Michigan

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
mussels across the entire Lake Michigan
so<00:01:12.590> we've<00:01:12.740> seen<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.070> whole<00:01:13.310> shift<00:01:13.970> in

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
so we've seen this whole shift in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.950 
so we've seen this whole shift in
ecosystem<00:01:14.960> as<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.910> trophic<00:01:17.300> cascade<00:01:17.810> is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
ecosystem as the this trophic cascade is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.110 
ecosystem as the this trophic cascade is
going<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.590> food<00:01:18.890> web<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.310> causing

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to the food web and causing

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.840 
going to the food web and causing
declines<00:01:20.510> at<00:01:20.870> every<00:01:21.320> level<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.550> food<00:01:22.730> web

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
declines at every level of the food web

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.030 
declines at every level of the food web
and<00:01:22.910> it's<00:01:23.120> just<00:01:23.300> unprecedented<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.290> this<00:01:24.860> is

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
and it's just unprecedented and this is

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.930 
and it's just unprecedented and this is
a<00:01:25.070> good<00:01:25.700> example<00:01:25.730> of<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.570> kind<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.140> abundance

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
a good example of the kind of abundance

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.300 
a good example of the kind of abundance
quagga<00:01:28.720> mussels<00:01:29.200> were<00:01:29.320> seeing<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.740> lake

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
quagga mussels were seeing on the lake

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.190 
quagga mussels were seeing on the lake
michigan<00:01:30.670> right<00:01:30.820> now<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.600> can't<00:01:31.840> even<00:01:31.960> do<00:01:32.170> a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
michigan right now it can't even do a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.540 
michigan right now it can't even do a
really<00:01:32.500> good<00:01:32.680> trawl<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.130> there<00:01:33.310> without

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
really good trawl out there without

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.210 
really good trawl out there without
getting<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.940> at<00:01:34.060> all<00:01:34.240> full<00:01:34.510> blog<00:01:34.900> muscles<00:01:35.410> and
