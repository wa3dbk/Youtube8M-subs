00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.690 
he's kind of a chubby guy you know it's
just<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.810> think<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.170> too<00:03:34.320> much<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.920> know<00:03:35.160> his

just I think it's too much you know his

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.910 
just I think it's too much you know his
body<00:03:35.940> should<00:03:36.269> be<00:03:36.299> whiter<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.530> shouldn't

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
body should be whiter and it shouldn't

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.800 
body should be whiter and it shouldn't
be<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.220> ripped<00:03:38.519> he's<00:03:38.760> not<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.120> rip<00:03:39.390> really

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
be that ripped he's not that rip really

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.289 
be that ripped he's not that rip really
and<00:03:40.019> they<00:03:40.709> missed<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.190> tattoo<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.910> his<00:03:42.030> ribs

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
mean everything moves like it should but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.559 
mean everything moves like it should but
those<00:03:59.220> are<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.400> some<00:03:59.609> big<00:03:59.850> things<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.359> feel

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
those are just some big things I feel

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.750

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.240 
kind of didn't like you know I thought
it<00:04:22.810> would<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:23.020> like<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.470> know<00:04:23.590> screen<00:04:23.919> printed

it would be like you know screen printed
on<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.550> which<00:04:24.639> I've<00:04:24.820> been<00:04:24.850> real<00:04:25.120> cool<00:04:25.330> but

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
on there which I've been real cool but

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.110 
on there which I've been real cool but
it's<00:04:25.660> just<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.900> sticker<00:04:26.580> still<00:04:27.580> cool<00:04:27.850> chairs

though<00:04:28.360> bottom<00:04:28.840> lines<00:04:29.050> should<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.440> get<00:04:29.560> these

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
though bottom lines should you get these

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.800 
though bottom lines should you get these
triggers<00:04:30.100> or<00:04:30.190> not<00:04:30.370> with<00:04:30.910> Shelton<00:04:31.270> Benjamin<00:04:31.300> I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
triggers or not with Shelton Benjamin I

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.330

they released him so they're not gonna

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.640 
they released him so they're not gonna
make<00:04:40.270> any<00:04:40.450> more<00:04:40.630> Shelton<00:04:41.020> Benjamin<00:04:41.050> figures
