00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this is my Yamaha what kind of Yamaha

this is my Yamaha what kind of Yamaha
are<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:11.340> doesn't<00:00:11.580> matter<00:00:11.820> whether<00:00:12.150> you're

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
are you it doesn't matter whether you're

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.120 
are you it doesn't matter whether you're
fishing<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.960> hundred<00:00:13.349> degree<00:00:13.620> temperature

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
fishing in a hundred degree temperature

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.640 
fishing in a hundred degree temperature
where<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.790> hot<00:00:14.969> or<00:00:15.480> minus<00:00:16.230> 20<00:00:16.619> or

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
where it's really hot or minus 20 or

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.490 
where it's really hot or minus 20 or
minus<00:00:17.070> 30<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.640> think<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.359> key<00:00:18.600> element<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.380> be

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
minus 30 I think a key element is to be

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.960 
minus 30 I think a key element is to be
comfortable<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.310> you're<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.760> under

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
comfortable so that you're not under

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.250 
comfortable so that you're not under
stress<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.630> concentrate<00:00:22.109> on

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
stress and you can concentrate on

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
stress and you can concentrate on
fishing<00:00:22.500> when<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> comes<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> ice<00:00:23.760> fishing

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
fishing when it comes to ice fishing

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.179 
fishing when it comes to ice fishing
traditionally<00:00:24.810> anglers<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.740> made<00:00:25.949> huts

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
traditionally anglers have made huts

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
traditionally anglers have made huts
because<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.699> does<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.359> cold<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.109> open

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
because it does get so cold on the open

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
because it does get so cold on the open
ice<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> windchill<00:00:29.670> factor<00:00:30.090> really

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
ice because the windchill factor really

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
ice because the windchill factor really
increases<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> only<00:00:31.619> problem<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.009> these

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
increases the only problem with these

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.650 
increases the only problem with these
Hut's<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.700> they're<00:00:32.880> heavy<00:00:33.090> they're<00:00:33.360> made

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Hut's is that they're heavy they're made

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.229 
Hut's is that they're heavy they're made
out<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> wood<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.380> metal<00:00:34.969> combinations<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
out of wood and metal combinations and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
out of wood and metal combinations and
once<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> get<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.079> set<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> location

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
once you get them set into a location

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
once you get them set into a location
most<00:00:38.790> fishermen<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.930> move<00:00:40.140> them

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
most fishermen don't like to move them

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.369 
most fishermen don't like to move them
so<00:00:40.860> you're<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.190> really<00:00:41.700> able<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.050> move<00:00:43.200> around

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so you're not really able to move around

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
so you're not really able to move around
and<00:00:43.710> follow<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> fish<00:00:44.370> when<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> fish<00:00:44.879> move

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and follow the fish when the fish move

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.209 
and follow the fish when the fish move
the<00:00:45.239> other<00:00:45.329> problem<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> last<00:00:46.980> week

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the other problem is over the last week

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
the other problem is over the last week
or<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.489> we've<00:00:47.640> had<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.210> cold<00:00:48.510> temperatures

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
or so we've had very cold temperatures

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
or so we've had very cold temperatures
and<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.680> mild<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.129> 10<00:00:50.340> above<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.850> fact

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and then very mild like 10 above in fact

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
and then very mild like 10 above in fact
yesterday<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.079> had<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> 4<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:52.890> 5<00:00:53.070> inches<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
yesterday we had up to 4 or 5 inches of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.000 
yesterday we had up to 4 or 5 inches of
water<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> ice<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> huts<00:00:55.739> have

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
water on the ice and a lot of huts have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
water on the ice and a lot of huts have
now<00:00:56.190> frozen<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.440> heavier

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
now frozen in these you know heavier

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.319 
now frozen in these you know heavier
huts<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> real<00:00:59.579> problem<00:00:59.850> because

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
huts so it's a real problem because

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
huts so it's a real problem because
anglers<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.590> off<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> ice<00:01:02.039> by

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
anglers have to take them off the ice by

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
anglers have to take them off the ice by
certain<00:01:02.609> date<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.539> I've<00:01:03.660> found<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
certain date so what I've found over the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
certain date so what I've found over the
years<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.070> having<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> portable<00:01:05.820> hut<00:01:06.090> like

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
years that having a portable hut like

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
years that having a portable hut like
this<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.750> whether<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> fish<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this one whether you want to fish as a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
this one whether you want to fish as a
family<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.760> maybe<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> 2<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.689> 3<00:01:09.900> man<00:01:10.080> hut<00:01:10.320> or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
family and maybe use a 2 or 3 man hut or

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
family and maybe use a 2 or 3 man hut or
a<00:01:10.770> single<00:01:11.340> portable<00:01:11.880> hot<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a single portable hot like this it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
a single portable hot like this it
really<00:01:13.229> gives<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> versatility<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
really gives you the versatility of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
really gives you the versatility of
walking<00:01:14.970> around<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.570> morning<00:01:15.960> we

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
walking around now this morning we

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
walking around now this morning we
probably<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.710> -<00:01:17.280> 2<00:01:17.549> -<00:01:17.670> -5<00:01:18.030> air

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
probably have about - 2 - -5 air

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
probably have about - 2 - -5 air
temperature<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:19.710> dressed<00:01:19.950> properly<00:01:20.159> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
temperature and I'm dressed properly so

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.910 
temperature and I'm dressed properly so
I'm<00:01:20.729> quite<00:01:21.030> warm<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.560> cold

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I'm quite warm but if it got really cold

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
I'm quite warm but if it got really cold
I<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> heater<00:01:23.610> under<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.270> that's<00:01:24.509> very

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I have a heater under here that's very

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.340 
I have a heater under here that's very
portable<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:26.220> simply<00:01:26.670> moving<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.869> arms

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
portable and by simply moving the arms

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
portable and by simply moving the arms
of<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.590> Hut<00:01:28.829> forward<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.729> enclose<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of this Hut forward I can enclose it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.859 
of this Hut forward I can enclose it
completely<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.670> cold<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.270> this

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
completely if it's really cold out this

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
completely if it's really cold out this
Hut<00:01:34.079> has<00:01:34.290> flaps<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.850> cold

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
Hut has flaps which because it's so cold

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
Hut has flaps which because it's so cold
I<00:01:36.270> haven't<00:01:36.570> pulled<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.229> flaps<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I haven't pulled out these flaps you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
big-game fishing I pull up on the fish

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
big-game fishing I pull up on the fish
and<00:03:17.760> then<00:03:18.180> reel<00:03:18.480> down<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.560> pick<00:03:19.740> up<00:03:19.860> my<00:03:20.040> line

and then reel down to pick up my line

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.040 
and then reel down to pick up my line
instead<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:20.940> sitting<00:03:21.210> in<00:03:21.300> one<00:03:21.480> spot<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050

instead of just sitting in one spot and
reeling<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> line<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.000> pulling<00:03:24.210> up<00:03:24.480> reel

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

down and I'm kind of going slow here

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
down and I'm kind of going slow here
because<00:03:29.670> these<00:03:29.850> guys<00:03:30.090> fight<00:03:30.360> pretty<00:03:30.630> hard<00:03:30.900> on

but<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.620> use<00:04:19.830> my<00:04:19.859> hands<00:04:20.310> old-school<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
but I just use my hands old-school I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.060 
but I just use my hands old-school I
guess<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.900> know<00:04:22.019> what<00:04:22.230> when<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.680> cold

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
guess and you know what when it's cold

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.100 
guess and you know what when it's cold
you<00:04:23.640> don't<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.060> lend<00:04:24.210> too<00:04:24.450> many<00:04:24.630> fish<00:04:24.900> one

you don't want to lend too many fish one

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.140 
you don't want to lend too many fish one
after<00:04:25.440> another<00:04:25.580> because<00:04:26.580> you<00:04:26.790> know<00:04:26.880> you'll

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
after another because you know you'll

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.570 
after another because you know you'll
freeze<00:04:27.479> up<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:28.530> there's<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.770> nice<00:04:28.979> lake<00:04:29.310> trout

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
freeze up now there's a nice lake trout

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.670 
freeze up now there's a nice lake trout
and<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.060> know<00:04:30.180> what<00:04:30.360> I've<00:04:30.540> got<00:04:30.720> one<00:04:31.200> whitefish

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and you know what I've got one whitefish

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.830 
and you know what I've got one whitefish
I'm<00:04:32.400> hoping<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.820> get<00:04:32.910> my<00:04:32.970> limit<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.360> white<00:04:33.540> fish

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
I'm hoping to get my limit of white fish

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.650 
I'm hoping to get my limit of white fish
this<00:04:34.410> lake<00:04:34.470> trout<00:04:34.890> isn't<00:04:35.280> too<00:04:35.460> big<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:36.510> it's

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
this lake trout isn't too big so it's

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.200 
this lake trout isn't too big so it's
going<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.930> be<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> good<00:04:37.590> eater<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.790> don't<00:04:38.850> see

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
going to be a good eater and I don't see

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.540 
going to be a good eater and I don't see
a<00:04:39.240> fin<00:04:39.540> clip<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:40.410> this<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.770> probably<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.160> natural

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
a fin clip so this is probably a natural

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.460 
a fin clip so this is probably a natural
reproduction<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.419> can<00:04:42.540> see<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.810> adipose<00:04:43.229> is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
reproduction you can see the adipose is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.790 
reproduction you can see the adipose is
there<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:44.640> anal<00:04:44.880> fin<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.210> there<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.570> tube

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
there the anal fin is there the tube

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800 
there the anal fin is there the tube
pelvis<00:04:46.800> fins<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.370> then<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> two<00:04:48.270> pectorals

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
pelvis fins and then the two pectorals

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.960 
pelvis fins and then the two pectorals
at<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> front<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.410> dorsal<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.760> I'm

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
at the front and the dorsal and I'm

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.030 
at the front and the dorsal and I'm
guessing<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.510> fish<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:51.870> about<00:04:52.040> three

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
guessing that this fish is about three

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.550 
guessing that this fish is about three
and<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.190> half<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.550> four<00:04:53.760> pounds<00:04:54.030> probably<00:04:54.360> 21<00:04:54.840> to

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
and a half to four pounds probably 21 to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.890 
and a half to four pounds probably 21 to
23<00:04:55.890> inches<00:04:56.190> long<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.700> he<00:04:56.820> hit<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.120> jig<00:04:57.450> there

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
23 inches long and he hit that jig there

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.630 
23 inches long and he hit that jig there
hold<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.169> up<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.919> see<00:04:59.460> that

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
hold it up so you can see it see that

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.600 
hold it up so you can see it see that
nice<00:05:00.200> foxy<00:05:01.200> jig<00:05:01.470> hooked<00:05:02.070> right<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> roof

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
nice foxy jig hooked right in the roof

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.120 
nice foxy jig hooked right in the roof
of<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.850> mouth<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.990> advantage<00:05:04.380> of<00:05:04.560> using<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
of the mouth the advantage of using the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.650 
of the mouth the advantage of using the
single<00:05:05.490> hook<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.820> that<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.090> usually<00:05:06.180> get<00:05:06.510> a

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
single hook is that you usually get a

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.630 
single hook is that you usually get a
very<00:05:06.960> good<00:05:07.020> hook<00:05:07.410> set<00:05:07.680> with<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.950> single<00:05:08.430> hook

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
very good hook set with a single hook

very good hook set with a single hook
