00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to all guys a panic greeting 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 and welcome back to this new video where 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.500
 finally I can show you the myth 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.420
 then we go back to the former cluster 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 of the destiny best way points as usual 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 I leave the link to the playlist in 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.789
 description went to make us a jump for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 see all the other weapons I have 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 reviewed and today we are here as you are 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 I said to finally speak in the myth 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.099
 cluster ex fuci the obtainable merger 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 only completing the glass vault 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 at the hard level more precisely the drop 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 which will give you the final boss to you on 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.719
 I had to do it about thirty 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 times to get this this weapon that 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.500
 I wanted so much no more than 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.870
 another for its objective strength 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.950
 within the game but for collection 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.239
 in short, let's say for completeness 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 of the game however yes we go to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590
 analyze the statistics of this weapon 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.239
 which as you can see I'm still max but went 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 which in any case is absolutely one of the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 primary weapons stronger than the game before 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.039
 what to say as you see in an attack 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 maximum of 323 don't say 331 this 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.659
 because she was nervous a little while ago 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 because it was really too much stronger 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.900
 so compared to the other weapons it was 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 brought to a level a little bit 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.280
 minor of attack 323 the first thing that 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 this skill catches your eye 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.320
 wonderful this fantastic shape 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 of the weapon that really makes it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.450
 really really unique then let's go 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.670
 to see the first recovery statistics 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 is a low recovery then a must 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 loading speed before the shot 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.149
 a little bit low impact not much 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.679
 high range so so stability 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.780
 really really high because this 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.880
 it comes from the upgrading I will do 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.679
 see later otherwise one by one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.450
 low stability and enough charging 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.490
 fast we go to see the statistics 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 myth eternal class this weapon must not 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.549
 charge each time it is pressed 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.460
 the trigger fires a single shot 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.270
 perfect and inflicts sun damage 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.819
 these are the upgrades for 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.119
 regarding ballistics then 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.170
 aggressive ballistics that as you see 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.090
 increases the impact of the range 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.829
 detriment of the stability the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.380
 linear compensator that increases in fact 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.090
 agitated once again at the expense of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.340
 stability while the recoil control 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.079
 which greatly increases the stability vi 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.760
 I'll show you here so then 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.200
 it is absolutely the enhancement that there is 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.880
 advice as this weapon a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.590
 recoil discreetly then the other 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.239
 zen moment cause damage with this weapon 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.860
 namente stability so obviously 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.060
 the more we shoot the enemies the more this weapon 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.720
 the classic becomes stable 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 damage enhancement then the three why 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.500
 those we say most important charger 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.389
 extended increase type precision e 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.069
 increase in character agility 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.560
 when this weapon is kept less 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.680
 I advise you to increase 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.389
 throw precision because it makes it 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.790
 really really strong or a 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.579
 second perhaps in pvp a loader more 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.780
 large depends on you management of the 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.700
 crowd killing with this weapon 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.620
 provide bonus damage for a short time 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 even here it has potentially very useful 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.100
 especially when we face each other 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.389
 to a great host of enemies though 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.440
 we shoot in bursts and continue 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.810
 kill 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.950
 slaves in the raid come to mind 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 rather than in some versions 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.440
 we always do more and more details 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.859
 give up really to adopt the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.750
 enemies with one shot while we finish 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.220
 to chat pass under the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.930
 gameplay images as usual 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.389
 this is a boys weapon that me 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.569
 I absolutely wanted so much 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.609
 was delighted to get it when 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.519
 when I finally found it I will use it 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.599
 very much of course they fill up slots 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.220
 exotic 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.330
 so if you use the cash box you ca n't 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.640
 use exotic weapons 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.350
 secondary and in special this goes one 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.980
 I bit your discretion whatever you 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.180
 I repeat it is a weapon that I love very much e 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.210
 very very strong then going to i 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.190
 solar so this is an advantage in 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.290
 more because the dog will be useful to you 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.930
 night falls with active solar embers 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.460
 however it is a maximum attack of 323 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.040
 that more for example than the vision of 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.170
 confluence which is a that conceals a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.180
 300 so it is a weapon absolutely from 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.400
 have both for its uniqueness in term 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.650
 of skins, however, for its usefulness 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.110
 in-game level 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.370
 let me know below if you too 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.440
 you have it if you too have struggled 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.270
 so much to get it like me anyway 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680
 whatever comes to your mind as at 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.400
 usually leave a like and if you do not 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.500
 you still have done 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.269
 subscribe my channel we see each other 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.330
 the next video in the best way test 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.519
 where I'll probably take you so far 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.740
 the strongest weapon of the game therefore not 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.210
 miss the next video 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.210
 a greeting rapani hi guys
