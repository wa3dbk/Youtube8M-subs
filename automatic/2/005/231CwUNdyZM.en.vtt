00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
because it's what he call it dry rot or

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.080 
because it's what he call it dry rot or
whatnot<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.229> car<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.590> basically<00:01:12.090> in

pretty<00:01:13.450> good<00:01:13.510> shape<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.340> was<00:01:15.550> not

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
pretty good shape but it was not

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.840
