00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
three in fab cleaned up all the rust on

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.480 
three in fab cleaned up all the rust on
it<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.000> when<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.800> got<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> rust<00:00:23.189> off<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it and when the got all the rust off it

bottom of the tank I've seen a previous

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.670 
bottom of the tank I've seen a previous
repair<00:00:26.789> job<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.359> solder<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.080> we've

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
repair job here with solder and we've

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
repair job here with solder and we've
got<00:00:28.830> three<00:00:29.400> main<00:00:29.550> areas<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.000> around<00:00:30.240> this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
got three main areas right around this

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.770 
got three main areas right around this
area<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.260> area<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:32.090> little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
area this area a little bit here and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
area this area a little bit here and
okay<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.380> ears<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.010> area<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.730> maybe

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
okay for ears this area there and maybe

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.209 
okay for ears this area there and maybe
one<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:36.960> there<00:00:37.200> that's<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:37.649> holes<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
one more there that's got holes in it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
one more there that's got holes in it
I'm<00:00:38.640> gonna<00:00:38.760> try<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.030> repair<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.930> j-b<00:00:40.290> weld

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I'm gonna try to repair it with j-b weld

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
I'm gonna try to repair it with j-b weld
with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> jb<00:00:41.579> weld<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.059> bite<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
with the jb weld you can bite in the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.240 
with the jb weld you can bite in the
tubes<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.649> take

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
tubes and what you got to do is take

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
tubes and what you got to do is take
roughly<00:00:44.730> equal<00:00:45.030> parts<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> jb<00:00:45.809> weld<00:00:46.219> mix

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
roughly equal parts of the jb weld mix

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.900 
roughly equal parts of the jb weld mix
them<00:00:47.340> together<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.520> once<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
them together and then once you have a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.819 
them together and then once you have a
pretty<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.270> consistency<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.110> then

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty good consistency of it then

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
pretty good consistency of it then
you're<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.309> spread<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> holes<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
you're gonna spread it on the holes and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.450 
you're gonna spread it on the holes and
see<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.870> make<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.140> repairs<00:00:55.500> I'll<00:00:56.160> let<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
see if I can make my repairs I'll let it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
see if I can make my repairs I'll let it
sit<00:00:57.090> overnight<00:00:57.379> sand<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> down<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
sit overnight sand it down and then I

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
sit overnight sand it down and then I
should<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.520> ready<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> start<00:01:00.050> have<00:01:01.050> any<00:01:01.260> fuel

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
should be ready to start have any fuel

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.439 
should be ready to start have any fuel
stored<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> again<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.239> heater

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
stored in it again and have my heater

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
stored in it again and have my heater
back<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> pretty<00:01:05.670> good

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
back up and going so I got a pretty good

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
back up and going so I got a pretty good
consistency<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.170> take<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:07.619> dab

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
consistency there so take a little dab

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:29.930 
consistency there so take a little dab
of<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.770 

I<00:01:31.400> may<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.940> a<00:01:33.000> second<00:01:33.450> round<00:01:33.630> if

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I may have to do this a second round if

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860 
I may have to do this a second round if
the<00:01:33.930> balls<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.230> too<00:01:34.380> deep<00:01:35.720> hopefully<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> can

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
the balls are too deep hopefully I can

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.200 
the balls are too deep hopefully I can
glob<00:01:37.470> them<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:38.010> there<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.940> I<00:01:38.970> really

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
glob them up in there and all I really

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
glob them up in there and all I really
have<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.510> do<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> sand<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> down

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
have to do is sand it down

00:01:40.680 --> 00:03:01.820 
have to do is sand it down
what's<00:01:41.490> tomorrow<00:01:41.640> rolls<00:01:42.030> around

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.620 

and<00:03:02.250> basically<00:03:02.730> looks<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.300> got<00:03:03.480> all<00:03:03.600> my

and basically looks like I got all my

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.260 
and basically looks like I got all my
areas<00:03:04.110> covered<00:03:04.500> except<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.070> one<00:03:05.270> I'm

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
areas covered except for this one I'm

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.600 
areas covered except for this one I'm
gonna<00:03:06.450> let<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.690> dry<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.920> stand<00:03:08.310> them<00:03:08.490> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
gonna let it dry and stand them the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.020 
gonna let it dry and stand them the
others<00:03:08.880> I'll<00:03:09.780> come<00:03:10.020> back<00:03:10.580> I'll<00:03:11.580> try<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> hit

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
others I'll come back I'll try to hit

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.180 
others I'll come back I'll try to hit
that<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.410> make<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.740> as<00:03:13.890> smooth

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
that one up so I can make it as smooth

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.180 
that one up so I can make it as smooth
as<00:03:14.690> as<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.960> rest<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.350> surrounding<00:03:16.890> metal

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
as as the rest of the surrounding metal

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.790
