the<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.500> game<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:02.009> played<00:02:02.219> was<00:02:02.399> strike<00:02:02.700> zone

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
the first game we played was strike zone

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.240 
the first game we played was strike zone
sorry<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.200> domination<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.770> strike<00:02:05.040> zone

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
sorry it was domination on strike zone
and<00:02:05.630> i<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.960> i<00:02:07.020> went<00:02:07.110> 16<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.710> 22<00:02:08.250> which<00:02:08.429> was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and i think i went 16 for 22 which was

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.770 
and i think i went 16 for 22 which was
really<00:02:08.879> difficult<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> deal<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.629> because

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
really difficult to deal with because

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.650 
really difficult to deal with because
every<00:02:10.349> time<00:02:10.379> i<00:02:10.560> had<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> one-on-one<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.310> lot

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
every time i had a one-on-one a lot

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.660 
every time i had a one-on-one a lot
he<00:02:11.810> was<00:02:11.990> as<00:02:12.110> simple<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.710> could<00:02:13.130> not<00:02:13.160> win

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
he was as simple as that I could not win

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.000 
he was as simple as that I could not win
a<00:02:13.880> single<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.360> on<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:15.260> all<00:02:15.380> 16<00:02:15.800> kills

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
a single one on one I think all 16 kills

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.680 
a single one on one I think all 16 kills
I<00:02:16.160> got<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.520> where<00:02:16.670> people<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.180> had<00:02:17.540> their

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
so bad but um but yeah I found it quite

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.880 
so bad but um but yeah I found it quite
hard<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.870> do<00:02:36.020> with<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> kept<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.650> lot<00:02:36.740> of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
hard to do with but I kept a lot of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.960 
hard to do with but I kept a lot of
flags<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.280> I'd<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.520> think<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.880> had

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
flags and I'd like to think I had

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.280 
flags and I'd like to think I had
contributed<00:02:38.240> quite<00:02:38.630> well<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.050> winning<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
contributed quite well to winning that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.710 
contributed quite well to winning that
domination<00:02:39.950> game<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> then<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.240> moved<00:02:41.450> over

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
domination game and then we moved over

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.690 
domination game and then we moved over
into<00:02:41.750> search<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.350> destroy<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.520> was

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
into search and destroy and that was

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.340 
into search and destroy and that was
where<00:02:43.880> things<00:02:44.150> went<00:02:44.360> horribly<00:02:44.450> wrong<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.050> me

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
where things went horribly wrong for me

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.920 
where things went horribly wrong for me
I<00:02:45.380> went<00:02:45.650> 1<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.190> 8<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:47.120> managed<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:47.840> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
I went 1 for 8 I managed to get the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.690 
I went 1 for 8 I managed to get the
first<00:02:48.170> blood<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> first<00:02:48.860> round<00:02:49.100> which<00:02:49.490> was

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
first blood in the first round which was

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.460 
first blood in the first round which was
pleased<00:02:49.940> with<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> guy<00:02:51.050> who<00:02:51.110> came

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
pleased with but the guy who came

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.470 
pleased with but the guy who came
towards<00:02:51.920> me<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.190> was<00:02:52.310> actually<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> only<00:02:52.880> 1<00:02:53.360> on

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
towards me it was actually the only 1 on

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.630 
towards me it was actually the only 1 on
1<00:02:53.570> gunfighter<00:02:54.020> 1<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:55.250> think<00:02:55.310> he<00:02:55.550> was
