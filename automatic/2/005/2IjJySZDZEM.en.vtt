other cooler I had was a blizzard
Coolermaster<00:01:21.510> blizzard<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:21.900> problem<00:01:22.350> and

Coolermaster blizzard the problem and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.510 
Coolermaster blizzard the problem and
that<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:24.110> had<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> sort<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.620> mess<00:01:26.340> around

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that was I had to sort of mess around

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.360 
that was I had to sort of mess around
with<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.120> get<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.510> fit<00:01:27.750> properly<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
with it to get it to fit properly in the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.950 
with it to get it to fit properly in the
configuration<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.180> prodigious<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.780> what

configuration that prodigious now what
are<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.260> in<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.440> pool

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
are they in a pool

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
are they in a pool
just<00:01:32.400> pull<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.850> air<00:01:32.910> right<00:01:33.120> through<00:01:33.330> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
just pull in the air right through the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.130 
just pull in the air right through the
case<00:01:33.800> so<00:01:34.800> you'll<00:01:34.980> pull<00:01:35.160> it<00:01:35.190> in<00:01:35.400> from<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.700> front

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
case so you'll pull it in from the front

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.230 
case so you'll pull it in from the front
and<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:38.240> that's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and all the way out to the back that's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.800 
and all the way out to the back that's
the<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> wanted<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.400> bird

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the way I wanted it to be that the bird

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.400 
the way I wanted it to be that the bird
would<00:01:42.810> only<00:01:42.990> fit<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.570> with<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.660> fan<00:01:45.900> sucking

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
would only fit and with the fan sucking

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.620 
would only fit and with the fan sucking
up<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:48.530> graphics<00:01:49.530> card<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.980> little

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
up from the graphics card the little

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.240 
up from the graphics card the little
video<00:01:51.630> card<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.800> was<00:01:52.980> no<00:01:53.160> good<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.980> had

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
video card and that was no good so I had

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
video card and that was no good so I had
to<00:01:56.460> well<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.150> bought<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.690> was<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.050> buy

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to well I bought this I was going to buy

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
to well I bought this I was going to buy
the<00:01:58.200> ball<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.010> 12<00:01:59.370> which<00:01:59.550> opponent<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.120> Barrow

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the ball to 12 which opponent in Barrow

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.980 
the ball to 12 which opponent in Barrow
because<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.190> could<00:02:02.190> fit<00:02:02.460> two<00:02:02.790> fans<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.840> then

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because I could fit two fans on it then

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
because I could fit two fans on it then
I<00:02:04.290> wanted<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.740> overclock<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.190> little<00:02:05.580> bit<00:02:05.760> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I wanted to overclock a little bit I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.480 
I wanted to overclock a little bit I
waiting<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.170> some<00:02:07.320> ROM<00:02:07.530> come<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:08.010> another

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
waiting for some ROM come in another

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.720 
waiting for some ROM come in another
four<00:02:08.850> gigs<00:02:09.119> around<00:02:09.300> before<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.730> this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
four gigs around before I do that this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.910 
four gigs around before I do that this
mother<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.210> won't<00:02:12.450> let<00:02:12.630> me<00:02:12.890> overclock<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
mother would won't let me overclock the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.090 
mother would won't let me overclock the
CPU<00:02:15.170> independently<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.560> over<00:02:16.860> talks

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
CPU independently it over talks

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.010 
CPU independently it over talks
everything<00:02:17.610> at<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> same<00:02:18.780> time<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:21.020> haven't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
everything at the same time so I haven't

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.470 
everything at the same time so I haven't
figured<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.440> value<00:02:23.010> nesters<00:02:23.580> that's<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
figured that value nesters that's the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
figured that value nesters that's the
way<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.230> over<00:02:25.380> plots<00:02:25.740> everything

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
way it is it just over plots everything

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.040 
way it is it just over plots everything
just<00:02:26.730> keeps<00:02:26.970> everything<00:02:27.150> immortal

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.840 

you<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> front<00:02:30.740> side<00:02:30.920> bus<00:02:31.160> speeding<00:02:31.490> and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
you do the front side bus speeding and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.530 
you do the front side bus speeding and
that's<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:35.990> see<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
that's it as you can see this is the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.800 
that's it as you can see this is the
cooler<00:02:38.540> master<00:02:38.720> hyper<00:02:40.030> 103<00:02:41.030> it's<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.390> really

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
cooler master hyper 103 it's a really

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.020 
cooler master hyper 103 it's a really
beautiful<00:02:42.020> fan<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.830> whole<00:02:42.980> theme<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.550> PC

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
beautiful fan the whole theme of this PC

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.780 
beautiful fan the whole theme of this PC
was<00:02:44.210> white<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.680> fan<00:02:45.920> came<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.400> blue<00:02:46.610> but

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
was white and the fan came in blue but

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.670 
was white and the fan came in blue but
it's<00:02:46.910> actually<00:02:47.210> worked<00:02:47.450> out<00:02:47.570> not<00:02:47.810> too<00:02:48.020> bad

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
it's actually worked out not too bad

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.550 
it's actually worked out not too bad
it's<00:02:49.220> quite<00:02:49.460> nice<00:02:51.700> poor<00:02:52.700> we<00:02:52.850> were<00:02:52.880> closer<00:02:53.560> so

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
it's quite nice poor we were closer so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:08.430 
it's quite nice poor we were closer so
then<00:02:54.740> get<00:02:54.950> it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.949 

nice<00:03:09.010> looking<00:03:09.400> thing

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.920 

and<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.680> runs<00:03:13.829> really<00:03:14.400> quiet<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.719> comes

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and it runs really quiet and it comes

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.080 
and it runs really quiet and it comes
with<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.310> PWM<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.519> lot<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.849> speed<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:19.769> pin<00:03:20.060> jack

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
with a PWM and lot to speed for pin jack

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750 
with a PWM and lot to speed for pin jack
so<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.810> plug<00:03:22.019> straight<00:03:22.349> into<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.859> four<00:03:23.579> pin

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
so just plug straight into the four pin

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.789 
so just plug straight into the four pin
on<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.000> motherboard<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.719> runs<00:03:25.560> at<00:03:25.739> the

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
on the motherboard so runs at the

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.440 
on the motherboard so runs at the
temperature<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.579> system<00:03:26.730> which<00:03:27.420> is
