00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 these machines are commonly called 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.280
 3d printers in the industry are called 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.690
 rapid prototyping machines or 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.750
 manufacture on demand 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.240
 and the process of this technology called 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.880
 fm by mode position fuse in 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.910
 English that is the deposition of material 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.250
 cast layer to layer what it does is to 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.289
 that they understand it clearly, it's as if 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.719
 it was a chef's sleeve when one 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.500
 squeeze the sleeve comes out a bit of the 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.510
 Use pasta to cook if one with 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.579
 this is drawing a line around 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.399
 the other can create a piece in two 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.410
 dimensions if above that layer draws 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.350
 other pieces and above another and above another 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.609
 and another one creating a surface in 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.379
 three dimensions one object in three 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.329
 dimensions these machines work from 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.550
 the same way by handling a book of 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.079
 plastic one from the other until you finish 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.059
 build the first layer after passing 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.039
 to the second the third and so on until 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.199
 the piece ends the machine takes a 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.909
 file that brings the instructions of 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.139
 where are the coordinates and how much 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.600
 plastic has to leave in each place 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.430
 to build the object this file 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.020
 born from a model in three dimensions 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.970
 that is analyzed by the software with the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.260
 the machine comes and prepares the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.690
 instructions for the machine to 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.010
 move and is already that model in three 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.970
 dimensions may arise from several 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.040
 sources 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.020
 from the same person as the models and 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.050
 they have knowledge for their modeling in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 three dimensions can come from sites 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.260
 on the internet, most of them 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.880
 facilitate the exchange of files 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.070
 Such three - dimensional between 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.040
 users for example a user in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.250
 canada draws a piece the one goes up in 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.050
 china the low one at 15 minutes the edits 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.470
 in the improvement it goes up again after 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.880
 in return in belgium it goes down in another one and thus 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.470
 there was a community of users that 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 they are modifying and creating files 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.880
 creating content for what later 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.440
 so that the housewife so that the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
 person who does not have the knowledge of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.790
 to model between dimensions can 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.680
 download it and print it and get 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.660
 a piece without having a kind of 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.990
 knowledge and finally the third 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.090
 option is to have a 3d scanner that what 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.130
 allows is to have a physical object that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.200
 one you already know you already have and not have to 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.380
 be stuck for many hours with a great 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.820
 cost going digital and one of the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.680
 premises with which we created the company 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.260
 was that the machine has answers 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 national 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.610
 disposition of the materials of the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.070
 resin to be very expensive and that there was not in 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.450
 the national level was an obstacle and 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.850
 we saw that our consumer was going to 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.800
 have a problem the end user of the 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.270
 machine is going to have a problem then 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.420
 we turn to this type of machines 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.730
 which is simpler in the operation the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.580
 machine start does not have 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.670
 waste is very friendly with the 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.670
 user
