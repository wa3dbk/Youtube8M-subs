00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 Consider just an awesome mod which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.910
 adds a few special blocks with 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.130
 the help of which you can quite 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 nice to ease your life in the world 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.690
 minecraft and the very first block 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.029
 called a bouncing block what is translated 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.580
 like jumping blog or if you translate 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 literally a trampoline if we just get up 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.660
 this block will throw us 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 pretty high by about 8 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 blocks up the next block is called 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.500
 padding block that literally translates 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 like stuffing or roughly speaking very and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
 very soft wool and if we are big 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.460
 heights fall on this soft wool then we 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 we won't lose a single heart of health 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.530
 the third block is called the block launcher that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 in translation means a block launcher and he 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 in fact almost nothing 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 differs from trampoline except 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 maximum jump height 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 the next block is called speed block i 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 I think that its name is so clear 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 if you start walking it tone you 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170
 very much soon thereby helping 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.149
 get to one point or another also 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 This mod adds these four 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.470
 trampolines with this arrow direction on 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.540
 trampoline indicate in which direction you are 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 you will fly for example this arrow 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.979
 indicates north direction as 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.380
 see we are flying right now in this 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 direction well and the second trampoline which 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.310
 we just landed throwing away 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.439
 to the south well and actually 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 thanks to this trampoline you are not only 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.930
 make it easier for you to survive but you can 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.610
 build your original map on 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.009
 passage but in principle that's all that 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.810
 there is in this mod I hope that this mod 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.659
 you liked and you can apply 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.430
