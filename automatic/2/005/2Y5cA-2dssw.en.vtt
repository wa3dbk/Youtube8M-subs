00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.466
 We always thought that the "aliens" had to come from other stars. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.482
 But they come from under the Pacific Ocean 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.057
 How is it going to happen ?! 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.964
 The first "Kaiju" appeared in San Francisco. 

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.874
 The subsequent damage to Manila 

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.892
 And the last one destroyed the town of Cabo 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.363
 And we know ... 

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:36.512
 It doesn't stop here for sure! 

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.826
 To fight the monsters ... 

00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:41.669
 We created our monsters for handling them. 

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:43.978
 From the Governor Geller Mordororo 

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.588
 We have to use new weapons. 

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:50.716
 "Jager Project" was born. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.016
 The mind and memory of two drivers ... 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.535
 Connect together ... 

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:07.400
 And man and machine become one 

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.616
 July 11 

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.492
 - Organize a huge set for them - today ... at the last point of everyone's hope ... 

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:27.958
 - or we are extinct - The end of the world, we all ... 

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:31.677
 We all choose to trust each other. 

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:36.547
 Today everyone saw the monster in front of our house. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 And today is the day we are canceling the end of the world! 

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.900
 It's cool. 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.500
