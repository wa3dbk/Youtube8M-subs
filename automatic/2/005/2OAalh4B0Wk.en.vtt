 very dry lackluster and strong 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 damaged hair due to the extra 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.429
 Rich care will therefore have been 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 nourished the itching reduces and the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.120
 dry scalp also on the hairline 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 at least 20 minutes, possibly several 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 Allow to act for hours then 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.399
 to the skin type suitable salon shampoo 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.230
 wash out 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.350
 the longer the answer time the more 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 the effect of the ingredients is more intense 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.239
 I'll show you now here on the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.180
 smell is very lemony but rather like that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 like yogurt, how would yo say? 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.369
 yogurt with a bit of lemon in it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.260
 like me in any case and me 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.360
 actually use it that way 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 I does that in the dry hair 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.700
 my client was wet i like this one 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.259
 bit of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.030
 and then I'll give her about until then 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.920
 in the hair 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.060
 and then I really leave her 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.460
 I leave at least one hour then 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 the hair cure act and then run 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760
 just come with such a dark itself 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200
 then always turn 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.140
 like that and then just run with one 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.240
 totally around and yes someday 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 Of course you can only do it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.440
 if you just really all day 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 Home is and then I was then 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.920
 they chop and then you have to be real 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.950
 say the hair feels really great 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.760
 super soft so they are shining they are 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.030
 really they are really that way 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.360
 silky smooth and yes you just fill them 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.130
 can be super healthy and what I like too 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.740
 still found is that this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.840
 Haarkur if you just so massaged 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.280
 and then it still rises like that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.920
 a bit high that's when you get them 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.890
 until then wears on then are actually 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
 the hair until then about with parkour 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.570
 so it gets a bit fuller 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.970
 high what you have to say after that is 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.240
 that the hair is still up to three 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.760
 Hair wash after application afterwards 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.850
 really still so smooth and soft 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.500
 are and especially the tips are the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.350
 then not feel dry at all 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.590
 then really so so healthy stop 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.450
 easy on and I'm super great 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.970
 Excited about this haag where I am 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 really think she cares very well and 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.480
 it is also very rich 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.680
 That's why I bought it myself so 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.290
 I would not say that now 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.880
 I have very dry hair but I have 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.580
 bought me because I'm off and 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870
 to yes, yet my hair is foehn and before 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.510
 especially now that I have the round brush 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.680
 I always have them for me from time to time 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.620
 I'll treat her too 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.170
 Straighteners with whom their curlers 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.540
 pure and yes he dries naturally 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.890
 The hair is a little bit out and that's why I have 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 granted me this hair cure 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.920
 Of course she does not smell that great, but 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.010
 I think 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.110
 you can not live with that then you have it 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.480
 still a few stamp and that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.470
 certified organic cosmetics then it is 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.230
 and painted on it and then 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.060
 GMO-free cosmetics I link 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.470
 Of course you also the side where I have them 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.720
 I have ordered it had in fact 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.209
 bought Austria 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.709
 in the internet, of course, otherwise what 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.110
 I have not said yet 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 she is what it looks like 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.930
 yogurt as they go so far and what you do 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.510
 still has to say in any case is if 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.269
 you used the hair cure and afterwards 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.190
 the hair is smooth 5 so now with 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.660
 It is anyway that the straightener 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.100
 hair shine for a long time but when you look at it 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.070
 just so smooth leads with the 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.959
 Round brush then you can see the hair 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.850
 really really shiny out so it 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.250
 then they really feel that way 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.989
 so smooth and so really see 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.120
 they really shine with full power 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.310
 and that's where I find this haag 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.889
 So also totally make this really is 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.870
 otherwise my hair shines 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.269
 otherwise if I just without her 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.060
 felt this hair cure 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.510
 then i think i have said everything and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.730
 I hope you could with the small 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.770
 review shows for me is her up 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.900
 In any case, a replenishment product too 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.600
 if she is relatively expensive now 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.210
 So I've been using it since then 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.610
 in the beginning of january and now so if i have that 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.410
 hold against the light until then 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.050
 now about half full 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.520
 I would say it is so it is 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.940
 relatively productive 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.950
 now we have march with the heart yes 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.320
 but it is not possible now 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.610
 super super duper productive but it works 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.900
 So I mean I clap it too 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.590

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.960
