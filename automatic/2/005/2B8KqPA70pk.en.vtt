00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:29.880 

we'll<00:03:17.640> peel<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.540> side<00:03:18.860> back

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890

oh<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.490> missed<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.030> screw

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.530 

the<00:04:10.450> clay<00:04:10.660> itself<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.320> still<00:04:11.530> pretty<00:04:11.740> wet

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
the clay itself is still pretty wet

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.610 
the clay itself is still pretty wet
surprisingly<00:04:13.540> enough<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.990> guess<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.320> got<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
surprisingly enough I guess I got the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.220 
surprisingly enough I guess I got the
Vaseline<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.190> there<00:04:15.340> good<00:04:15.520> and<00:04:16.420> our<00:04:16.870> flute

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
Vaseline in there good and our flute

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.670 
Vaseline in there good and our flute
came<00:04:17.590> out<00:04:17.770> there<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.250> some<00:04:18.489> cracking<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:20.650> I

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
came out there is some cracking but I

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020 
came out there is some cracking but I
don't<00:04:21.070> think<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.520> to<00:04:21.550> be<00:04:21.730> anything

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
don't think it's going to be anything

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:32.280 
don't think it's going to be anything
major<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:25.090> should<00:04:25.360> be<00:04:25.540> good<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.110> can

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
major so we should be good and I can

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.100 
major so we should be good and I can
make<00:04:32.680> up<00:04:32.860> a<00:04:32.980> small<00:04:33.220> thing<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.490> plaster<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.900> fill

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
make up a small thing a plaster to fill

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.570 
make up a small thing a plaster to fill
in<00:04:35.230> some<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.500> these<00:04:35.590> cracks<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.100> seems<00:04:36.340> like

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
in some of these cracks it seems like

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.620 
in some of these cracks it seems like
the<00:04:36.700> first<00:04:36.940> coat<00:04:37.240> it's<00:04:37.540> still<00:04:37.810> not<00:04:37.930> quite<00:04:38.410> dry

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the first coat it's still not quite dry

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.320

of the biggest thing I need to do is to

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.160 
of the biggest thing I need to do is to
take<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.350> off<00:05:23.530> of<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.210> edge<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:26.050> will

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
take that off of the edge and it will

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.860 
take that off of the edge and it will
fall<00:05:26.410> into<00:05:26.650> place<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:28.210> one<00:05:28.390> turned<00:05:28.660> out

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
fall into place and this one turned out

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.440 
fall into place and this one turned out
pretty<00:05:29.050> well<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:29.500> this<00:05:29.680> side<00:05:29.890> and<00:05:30.460> as<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.240> can

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
pretty well on this side and as you can

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.810 
pretty well on this side and as you can
see<00:05:31.600> it<00:05:31.720> helped<00:05:32.050> us<00:05:32.170> design<00:05:32.740> pretty<00:05:33.280> well<00:05:33.520> just

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
see it helped us design pretty well just

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.570 
see it helped us design pretty well just
a<00:05:36.820> little<00:05:37.420> bit<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.660> cracking<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:39.130> I'm<00:05:39.340> like<00:05:39.520> I

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
a little bit of cracking and I'm like I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.770 
a little bit of cracking and I'm like I
said<00:05:39.700> I'm<00:05:39.790> gonna<00:05:39.910> get<00:05:40.030> all<00:05:40.150> that<00:05:40.270> taken<00:05:40.450> care

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
said I'm gonna get all that taken care

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.520 
said I'm gonna get all that taken care
of<00:05:40.810> right<00:05:41.080> now

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
of right now

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.760 
of right now
so<00:05:41.770> nothing<00:05:42.450> bad<00:05:43.450> happened<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.110> all<00:05:44.590> right

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
so nothing bad happened so all right

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.760 
so nothing bad happened so all right
there<00:05:45.310> is<00:05:45.520> my<00:05:45.550> fluke<00:05:46.090> mold<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.660> will<00:05:47.350> see<00:05:47.590> y'all

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
there is my fluke mold I will see y'all

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.000 
there is my fluke mold I will see y'all
shortly<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:49.690> I've<00:05:49.930> broken<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.410> main<00:05:50.620> edges

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
shortly so I've broken the main edges

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.870 
shortly so I've broken the main edges
free<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.610> it's<00:05:52.240> kind<00:05:52.720> of<00:05:52.840> sealed<00:05:53.170> this<00:05:53.320> one<00:05:53.560> up

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
free and it's kind of sealed this one up

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.420 
free and it's kind of sealed this one up
but<00:05:54.880> not<00:05:55.120> too<00:05:55.420> much<00:05:55.630> I'm<00:05:56.050> guessing<00:05:56.620> what<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:56.830> my

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
but not too much I'm guessing what I my

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.240 
but not too much I'm guessing what I my
problem<00:05:57.880> was<00:05:58.090> is<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.870> started<00:05:59.680> pouring<00:05:59.950> layers

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
problem was is I started pouring layers

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.780 
problem was is I started pouring layers
of<00:06:00.550> plaster<00:06:01.030> way<00:06:01.360> too<00:06:01.420> fast

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
of plaster way too fast

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.700 
of plaster way too fast
and<00:06:03.790> that's<00:06:04.420> why<00:06:04.600> I<00:06:04.630> got<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:05.080> cracking<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.680> I

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
and that's why I got the cracking that I

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.610 
and that's why I got the cracking that I
do<00:06:07.560> as<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.740> can<00:06:08.920> see<00:06:09.540> the<00:06:10.540> only<00:06:10.720> real<00:06:11.320> dead

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
do as you can see the only real dead

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.680 
do as you can see the only real dead
space<00:06:11.890> like<00:06:12.190> had<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.550> work<00:06:12.850> with<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.300> cutaway

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
space like had to work with the cutaway

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.410 
space like had to work with the cutaway
is<00:06:13.720> here<00:06:14.230> and<00:06:14.410> I<00:06:15.340> probably<00:06:15.580> still<00:06:15.760> will<00:06:16.210> cut

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
is here and I probably still will cut

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.290 
is here and I probably still will cut
that<00:06:16.570> away<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.140> maybe<00:06:17.410> these<00:06:17.650> corners<00:06:18.300> but

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
that away and maybe these corners but

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.880 
that away and maybe these corners but
overall<00:06:19.600> I<00:06:19.900> really<00:06:20.290> didn't<00:06:20.470> have<00:06:20.590> a<00:06:20.650> lot<00:06:20.860> of

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
overall I really didn't have a lot of

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.680 
overall I really didn't have a lot of
dead<00:06:21.160> space<00:06:21.340> with<00:06:21.729> this<00:06:21.880> thing<00:06:22.150> this<00:06:22.360> huge

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
dead space with this thing this huge

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.640 
dead space with this thing this huge
like<00:06:22.930> blue

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
like blue

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.030 
like blue
like<00:06:23.800> you<00:06:23.979> see<00:06:24.220> is<00:06:24.520> huge<00:06:25.410> if<00:06:26.410> I<00:06:26.590> have<00:06:26.860> to

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
like you see is huge if I have to

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.520 
like you see is huge if I have to
remould<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.720> I'm<00:06:28.720> gonna<00:06:28.870> go<00:06:29.050> with<00:06:29.229> a<00:06:29.259> lower

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
remould it I'm gonna go with a lower

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.029 
remould it I'm gonna go with a lower
board<00:06:29.919> I'm<00:06:30.190> not<00:06:30.370> going<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.550> go<00:06:30.669> with<00:06:30.790> the<00:06:30.910> 2x4

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
board I'm not going to go with the 2x4

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.710 
board I'm not going to go with the 2x4
and<00:06:33.039> I'm<00:06:33.190> also<00:06:33.370> gonna<00:06:33.550> make<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.830> foot<00:06:35.830> pocket

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
and I'm also gonna make the foot pocket

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.189 
and I'm also gonna make the foot pocket
smaller<00:06:38.490> so<00:06:39.490> what<00:06:40.270> I<00:06:40.300> got<00:06:40.479> I'm<00:06:40.660> gonna<00:06:40.840> do<00:06:41.020> is

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
smaller so what I got I'm gonna do is

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.550 
smaller so what I got I'm gonna do is
let<00:06:41.350> this<00:06:41.500> dry<00:06:41.860> as<00:06:42.479> much<00:06:43.479> as<00:06:43.660> I<00:06:43.750> can<00:06:44.020> for<00:06:44.350> like

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
let this dry as much as I can for like

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.159 
let this dry as much as I can for like
the<00:06:44.710> next<00:06:44.740> day<00:06:45.100> or<00:06:45.220> two

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
the next day or two

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.060 
the next day or two
unfortunately<00:06:47.169> I<00:06:47.350> have<00:06:47.590> to<00:06:47.620> keep<00:06:47.710> it<00:06:47.949> outside

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
unfortunately I have to keep it outside

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.100 
unfortunately I have to keep it outside
but<00:06:48.550> luckily<00:06:48.759> I<00:06:48.940> have<00:06:49.060> this<00:06:49.330> nice<00:06:49.539> big<00:06:49.750> tarp

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
but luckily I have this nice big tarp

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.890 
but luckily I have this nice big tarp
over<00:06:50.289> here<00:06:50.910> to<00:06:51.910> throw<00:06:52.150> over<00:06:52.360> it<00:06:52.449> just<00:06:52.630> in<00:06:52.750> case

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
over here to throw over it just in case

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.730 
over here to throw over it just in case
it<00:06:53.080> rains<00:06:53.490> mm-hmm<00:06:54.520> for<00:06:55.060> my<00:06:55.180> first<00:06:55.930> mold<00:06:56.380> I'm

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
it rains mm-hmm for my first mold I'm

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.960 
it rains mm-hmm for my first mold I'm
very<00:06:57.729> happy<00:06:58.120> I<00:06:58.150> mean<00:06:58.360> I<00:06:58.510> did<00:06:58.690> have<00:06:58.900> a<00:06:58.930> few<00:06:59.199> spots

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
very happy I mean I did have a few spots

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.620 
very happy I mean I did have a few spots
the<00:07:00.970> region<00:07:01.360> came<00:07:01.630> up<00:07:02.490> there<00:07:03.490> and<00:07:03.880> up<00:07:04.210> there

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
the region came up there and up there

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.850 
the region came up there and up there
and<00:07:05.139> a<00:07:06.039> little<00:07:06.220> bit<00:07:06.340> up<00:07:06.550> there<00:07:06.930> but<00:07:07.930> with<00:07:08.830> a

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
and a little bit up there but with a

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.860 
and a little bit up there but with a
little<00:07:08.979> bit<00:07:09.100> of<00:07:09.190> creativity<00:07:09.729> I<00:07:10.210> can<00:07:10.479> kind<00:07:10.780> of

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
little bit of creativity I can kind of

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:28.399 
little bit of creativity I can kind of
make<00:07:11.080> it<00:07:11.260> work<00:07:11.470> so<00:07:13.860> thanks<00:07:14.860> for<00:07:14.979> watching

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:28.409 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.469 

you
