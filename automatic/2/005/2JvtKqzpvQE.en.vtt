let that slip down it'll be flush with
the<00:02:15.430> inside<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.269> plate

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.020 

and<00:02:22.390> then<00:02:22.690> we'll<00:02:22.900> slide<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.920> back<00:02:24.130> up<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
and then we'll slide that back up the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.180 
and then we'll slide that back up the
backside<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.780> it'll<00:02:26.020> be<00:02:26.170> sandwiched<00:02:27.010> in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
backside and it'll be sandwiched in

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.470 
backside and it'll be sandwiched in
there<00:02:27.310> include<00:02:27.730> in

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.330 

you

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.620 

so<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:44.459> get<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.840> file<00:02:45.840> out

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
so we get a file out

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
so we get a file out
this<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.170> bit<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:49.060> fit<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.540> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
this a little bit just to fit that and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.780 
this a little bit just to fit that and
then<00:02:51.340> we've<00:02:51.520> got<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:52.290> plug<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.520> it's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
then we've got a plug so that it's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.530 
then we've got a plug so that it's
sealed<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.740> see<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.580> under<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> cap<00:02:58.270> it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
sealed when we see it under the cap it

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.090 
sealed when we see it under the cap it
will<00:02:58.660> it'll<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.320> plug<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.860> like<00:03:00.040> that

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
will it'll have a plug in it like that

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.990 
will it'll have a plug in it like that
with<00:03:00.460> an<00:03:00.550> unscrew<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.460> hose<00:03:03.640> plant

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
with an unscrew and at the hose plant

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.900 
with an unscrew and at the hose plant
new<00:03:04.180> hose<00:03:04.420> plan<00:03:04.690> for<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.050> hose<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.830> a

new hose plan for the hose and this is a
one<00:03:09.910> inch<00:03:10.150> plastic<00:03:10.630> nipple<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:12.670> call<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
one inch plastic nipple we call it a

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.920 
one inch plastic nipple we call it a
riser<00:03:13.360> for<00:03:14.200> sprinkler<00:03:14.590> systems<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.930> it'll

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
riser for sprinkler systems and it'll

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.780 
riser for sprinkler systems and it'll
work<00:03:17.140> for<00:03:17.470> my<00:03:19.200> for<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.230> barbed<00:03:21.130> fitting<00:03:21.610> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
work for my for my barbed fitting and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.870 
work for my for my barbed fitting and
barbed<00:03:22.330> less<00:03:22.630> fitting<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> tube

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
barbed less fitting for the tube

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.460 
barbed less fitting for the tube
I<00:03:24.910> might<00:03:25.240> even<00:03:25.360> cut<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.810> down<00:03:26.020> a<00:03:26.080> little<00:03:26.290> bit

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
I might even cut that down a little bit

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
I might even cut that down a little bit
it's<00:03:26.710> it's<00:03:26.980> longer<00:03:27.340> than<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.670> needs<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.970> be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
it's it's longer than it needs to be

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.120 
it's it's longer than it needs to be
should<00:03:28.840> be<00:03:28.960> pretty<00:03:29.110> simple<00:03:29.350> that's<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.920> part

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
should be pretty simple that's the part

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.000 
should be pretty simple that's the part
you<00:03:30.280> need<00:03:30.460> and<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:31.420> little<00:03:31.630> PVC<00:03:32.080> glue<00:03:32.200> and
