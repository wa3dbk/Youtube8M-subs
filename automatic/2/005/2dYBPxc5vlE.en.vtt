things with drive-by-wire systems is

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.339 
things with drive-by-wire systems is
that<00:00:20.949> you<00:00:21.490> know<00:00:22.150> as<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.449> is<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.960> lack<00:00:23.320> of

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
that you know as the is the lack of

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.620 
that you know as the is the lack of
throttle<00:00:23.859> response<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:25.060> if<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.419> don't

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
throttle response so if you don't

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.630 
throttle response so if you don't
already<00:00:25.779> have<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.259> module<00:00:27.039> on<00:00:27.130> your<00:00:27.310> truck<00:00:27.609> that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
already have a module on your truck that

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.179 
already have a module on your truck that
that<00:00:28.570> increases<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.289> throttle<00:00:29.589> sensitivity

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
that increases the throttle sensitivity

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.420 
that increases the throttle sensitivity
this<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.579> a<00:00:30.609> nice<00:00:30.880> add-on<00:00:31.529> from<00:00:32.529> BD<00:00:32.920> here<00:00:33.220> so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
this is a nice add-on from BD here so

is<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.459> actually<00:03:47.580> want<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.030> connect<00:03:48.600> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
is we actually want to connect the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.250 
is we actually want to connect the
throttle<00:03:49.200> sensitivity<00:03:49.769> or<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:51.000> APS<00:03:51.750> harness

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
throttle sensitivity or the APS harness

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.580 
throttle sensitivity or the APS harness
into<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.040> box<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.940> click<00:03:54.440> OK

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
into the box to it click OK

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.590 
into the box to it click OK
so<00:03:56.040> now<00:03:56.220> we're<00:03:56.430> going<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.580> we've<00:03:57.180> reconnected

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
so now we're going to we've reconnected

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.210 
so now we're going to we've reconnected
our<00:03:57.840> battery<00:03:58.200> cables<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.709> what<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.890> actually

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
our battery cables and what we actually

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.380 
our battery cables and what we actually
have<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.640> we<00:03:59.730> actually<00:03:59.850> have<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.209> turn

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
have to do is we actually have to turn

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.759 
have to do is we actually have to turn
the<00:04:00.510> truck<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.350> program<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:03.769> booster

position number two position is about

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.960 
position number two position is about
50%<00:05:48.050> more<00:05:48.110> boost<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:49.280> number<00:05:49.550> three<00:05:49.790> position

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
50% more boost the number three position

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.410 
50% more boost the number three position
is<00:05:50.360> going<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.570> be<00:05:50.690> one<00:05:50.900> hundred<00:05:50.960> percent<00:05:51.170> more

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.770 
that's what this is designed to combat
we<00:06:55.130> should<00:06:55.340> have<00:06:55.520> a<00:06:55.730> much<00:06:56.030> crisper<00:06:56.450> throttle

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780

we should have a much crisper throttle
response<00:06:56.930> with<00:06:57.380> this<00:06:57.590> so<00:06:58.580> we're<00:06:58.700> going<00:06:58.790> to<00:06:58.850> try
