00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.180
 This is a big friends channel to expand the circle of big friends Make this tongueache this time 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.139
 I want to go there 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.849
 West is the completed front a from 4 beige white 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.710
 I'll ask myself to appear for comparison of the wallet Height of the head is roughly either 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.170
 Since even a 18 m is coming up on almost but is the same about the portion of the back To much 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.920
 Big 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.640
 You can see that I would like to compare with Zeta Plus, which is also a variation of data 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.900
 think 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.059
 I understand if you try side by side, but it is a little bit more of Gettsu people 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:38.770
 In terms of size, data + is closer to the data on which it is based, so it can be said that this is a small improvement version. 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.879
 When I become a wave rider with all deformations and data + something transformed , this type of hall is the head 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.160
 Though it comes to part 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.280
 All right 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.630
 In 2 It deformation mechanism is no Te the other also is considerably different like 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:52.640
 The pizza part has a wide range of motion and this way the attitude of the system can be taken like this waist part 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:56.269
 It will interfere and will not sit as deep as the data + without the foot coming too far, so then armed 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.150
 I think that I want to see this is a clay bazooka I use Rick Diaz 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:04.230
 It is the same thing as bazooka You can use it with your back on your back like now 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.560
 It is also possible to hold the hand like this Bazooka is the 36th rifle certified 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.610
 This beam rifle is the same as the Zeta Gundam beam rifle 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.270
 Of course it can also be used as a beam saber There is also a regular beam saber 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.000
 And the main weapon is here Mega Beam Rifle It's this in Data Gundam 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 Hyper mega launcher like a guy length also quite considerably 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.370
 It's a large weapon, so when it transforms into a wave rider, where will it go first ? 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.970
 Let's look at the next waverider form Highway Blider form completed 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.110
 Was 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.440
 Unlike the data wave bladder, it is quite heavily armed and has a visual impression. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.990
 A person and a sound are one beam rifle for scraper weathering . 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.860
 Unlike the Zetas, it seems that you can not fly in the atmosphere 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.190
 Mr. Rea fits in this way 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.450
 It was Zettsu of yes msz 001 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.950
 It is a mobile suit that has only a few settings, but this way it is shaped as a gun plastic 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.470
 I'm glad Thank you for viewing it Channel registration Comment evaluation Regards, etc. 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.750
 You wish 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:05.340
 It was a big face channel to expand the circle of big friends 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.340
