00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.690
 hi, treat them like they are, I hope 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 the video shown is very good 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.590
 the quite important topic that from the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.119
 folder or bb and also installation of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 all games administration of the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.990
 application many times in all those that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
 we are asked then well I will 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 clarify with this video so it 's the most 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 clear and concise possible and also what 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.999
 I will leave therefore in each description of each 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.339
 game for you to view link since 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.259
 all games in general 99 by 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.550
 cent is install in the same way and 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.070
 only some games will be of this 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 way so good let's go to the mess 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 then what we should do is 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.220
 download this explorer from 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 files called in that is worst file 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.790
 which is the best file explorer 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 that I used the launcher that I did not 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.290
 like which I love other than that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.630
 then we will start already after we enter 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.120
 to the file explorer let's go 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.600
 to the next route of dying terra 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.580
 Android folder and here good to repeat 9 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.950
 in the folder that are all in 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.840
 those that the files and data of the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.090
 games like say files of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 program in windows android would be 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.880
 this would be the disk c that would be windows 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.520
 program files and filmmakers the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.780
 folders then inside the baby it 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.740
 they will see all the folders and I have 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.569
 example I already have fifa people I have the one in 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 of good other games the theme that more 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.880
 I have all these each folder is from 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.289
 every game and well then what if 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.640
 I do not have that folder, I can not 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.679
 perform because I can not then it's 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.899
 come the case that it was not that the 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.289
 have directly we are going to go to 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.110
 new and we're going to create a folder and 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.450
 we put or bb and ok and ready and already within 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.979
 that folder we add the games well 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.989
 how good I am going to the games 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.700
 I have my saved games suppose 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:50.319
 that we are going to install a very install game 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.270
 a game I will really leave you in the 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.189
 freckles that are this one that is here or 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.819
 I will also leave them in what is the 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.280
 part of the data and folder and part of 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.599
 Africa apart so we do not assume 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.700
 I think I have the snag then what 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.319
 is going to be installed on the freckle in this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.149
 case the installer I have a canton 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.009
 must install if it's a game that gives them 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.840
 I leave pk format is already and install it and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.910
 we're ready and we can play 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.330
 now the case has come in that I have a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.560
 game with sd data and apart from apec 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.450
 before we are going to install this is a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.260
 hollywood that this is fast and it does not weigh 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.430
 much 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.170
 then the folder the data then 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.180
 usually starts by set so much 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.769
 so much so then we go to the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.269
 property we should know what weighs in 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.590
 this case weighs 200 megabytes and apeca 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.840
 then we are you will see the bloco and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.450
 other direct always said sometimes has 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.250
 sin csd together or data that is by a 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.930
 part of africa tests that you 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.730
 they go down all the parts they extract therefore 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 will always be the folder of this and the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.290
 sin then basically we put a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.349
 folder we are going to copy a new york 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.329
 obviate to move to copy we go to the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.790
 path that we said before folder 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.319
 android folder or bb if you do not already have it 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.390
 know that they have to create and that 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.010
 basically I'm going to give it to paste 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.569
 and we hope that it is copied in this case 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.069
 that is copied pretty fast this 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.920
 explorer I love it because it 's pretty 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.780
 fast 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.000
 once we do this we go to the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.360
 previous route and we already installed what is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.590
 Africa is installing and it's ready 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.500
 there we have the game completely 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.410
 installed and it's already so good 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.080
 would be all for this case not for example 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.840
 ego spiderman is install in the folder 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.360
 web is installed in the data folder but 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.950
 good when a game is different 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.900
 the installation I will show it to the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.420
 disc the video but since everything everything 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.640
 requires the same vb data folder and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.650
 folder to android cuts in that the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.540
 internal memory to put the memory 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.730
 external do not work unless they have 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.370
 a third party application then it is 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.069
 internal memory folder android folder 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.830
 or baby if you do not have it create the folder 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.360
 and paste the data folder sd a 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.500
 Once you have done that, remember that 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.290
 go again 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.580
 they install their normal game apk and you're done 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.590
 there you have the project is also 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.819
 installed and it works as well as those of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.989
 this way sanz will be all the games 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.890
 say good I hope you have clarified 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.780
 all the doubts 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.910
 remember to leave your like if this little 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.230
 tutorial has served them a greeting to 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.230
 we all see in a next video
