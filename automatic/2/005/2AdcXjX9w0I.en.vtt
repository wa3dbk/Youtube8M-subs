00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to be customizing those presets so that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.899

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you are hearing what they designed the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.990 
you are hearing what they designed the
game<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> hear<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.970> I

think that is pretty cool and would be

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.260 
think that is pretty cool and would be
worth<00:01:17.850> getting<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.939> modern<00:01:20.939> warfare<00:01:21.090> 3

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
worth getting the modern warfare 3

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.320 
worth getting the modern warfare 3
branded<00:01:22.229> headsets<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
branded headsets and I don't know if you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.840 
branded headsets and I don't know if you
already<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.049> PX<00:01:25.680> 5<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
already have the PX 5 so that's what it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
already have the PX 5 so that's what it
these<00:01:27.450> look<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.900> version<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> PX<00:01:29.369> 5s

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
these look like a version of the PX 5s

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
these look like a version of the PX 5s
but<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> already<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.049> PX<00:01:31.470> 5s<00:01:32.040> then

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but if you already have the PX 5s then

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
but if you already have the PX 5s then
turtle<00:01:32.909> beach<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.270> probably<00:01:33.840> going<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
turtle beach is probably going to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
turtle beach is probably going to
release<00:01:34.740> those<00:01:35.610> presets<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
these are released and so I don't know

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.580 
these are released and so I don't know
if<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.560> worth<00:01:43.610> buying<00:01:45.049> just<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> mw3

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
