especially the Cutie Mark Crusaders so
okay<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.500> might<00:00:28.949> be

okay so I think one of you might be

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.470 
okay so I think one of you might be
saying<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.699> should<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.000> watched<00:00:30.179> us<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

little<00:00:30.779> bit<00:00:30.900> wary<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.820> because<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.270> call<00:00:33.480> her

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.319 
little bit wary but because we call her
mommy<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.700> might<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
mommy so I don't think that might be a

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.280 
mommy so I don't think that might be a
good<00:00:36.510> idea<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.989> it's
