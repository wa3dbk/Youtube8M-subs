so<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> sandbox<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.720> new<00:00:19.020> space<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.619> about

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so the sandbox is a new space it's about

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
so the sandbox is a new space it's about
a<00:00:19.830> year<00:00:20.039> old<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.430> library<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.449> an

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
a year old in the library and it's an

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.590 
a year old in the library and it's an
experimental<00:00:22.230> technology<00:00:23.039> space<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.670> ASP<00:00:24.330> su

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
experimental technology space the ASP su

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.279 
experimental technology space the ASP su
o<00:00:24.840> IT<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> library<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.910> contributed<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
o IT and the library all contributed to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.339 
o IT and the library all contributed to
create<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> space<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.599> has<00:00:30.599> movable

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
create a space that has movable

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
create a space that has movable
furniture<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.219> has<00:00:32.399> technology<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.329> can

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
furniture and has technology that can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
furniture and has technology that can
change<00:00:34.140> based<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.010> students

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
change based on what we think students

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.160 
change based on what we think students
might<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.700> interested<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.450> using

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.870 

so<00:00:42.170> this<00:00:42.500> is<00:00:42.680> our<00:00:42.829> family-friendly<00:00:43.520> study

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
so this is our family-friendly study

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120 
so this is our family-friendly study

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.399 

so<00:01:21.640> right<00:01:22.030> now<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.240> are<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.260> the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
so right now we are in one of the

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.080 
so right now we are in one of the
library's<00:01:23.770> groups<00:01:24.040> study<00:01:24.340> rooms<00:01:24.610> we<00:01:24.880> have

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
library's groups study rooms we have

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.149 
library's groups study rooms we have
several<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:26.049> one<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.440> one<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:26.650> our<00:01:26.830> tech

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
several this one is one of our tech

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.790 
several this one is one of our tech
enabled<00:01:27.790> rooms<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.420> we<00:01:28.990> actually<00:01:29.140> have<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
enabled rooms so we actually have a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500 
enabled rooms so we actually have a
computer<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.369> can<00:01:30.700> move<00:01:30.850> around<00:01:31.000> so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
computer that can move around so

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.440 
computer that can move around so
students<00:01:31.990> can<00:01:32.290> sit<00:01:32.979> down<00:01:33.190> with<00:01:34.000> other<00:01:34.180> people

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
students can sit down with other people

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.700 
students can sit down with other people
that<00:01:34.570> they're<00:01:34.690> working<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.229> group<00:01:35.440> and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
that they're working in in a group and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.900 
that they're working in in a group and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.890 

we<00:01:41.910> have<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> great<00:01:42.480> stuff<00:01:42.750> happening
