00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
you like so if you have 8 gigabytes i

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.830 
you like so if you have 8 gigabytes i
would<00:02:14.080> suggest<00:02:14.260> using<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.459> me<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
would suggest using for like me if you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.020 
would suggest using for like me if you
have<00:02:16.959> 4<00:02:17.230> gigabytes<00:02:17.680> i<00:02:17.920> would<00:02:18.040> use<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.490> if<00:02:18.820> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
have 4 gigabytes i would use to if you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660 
have 4 gigabytes i would use to if you
have<00:02:19.180> 2<00:02:19.360> gigabytes<00:02:19.840> i'd<00:02:20.410> probably<00:02:20.650> use<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.430> or

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
have 2 gigabytes i'd probably use one or

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.160 
have 2 gigabytes i'd probably use one or
maybe<00:02:22.630> even<00:02:22.750> change<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:24.209> 500<00:02:26.400> 512<00:02:27.400> m<00:02:28.170> change

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
maybe even change it to 500 512 m change

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.410 
maybe even change it to 500 512 m change
the<00:02:29.410> g2<00:02:29.830> an<00:02:29.950> m<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.030> would<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.390> change

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the g2 an m and you would have to change

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.600 
the g2 an m and you would have to change
this<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:33.420> 256m<00:02:34.470> okay<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.769> then<00:02:36.220> once<00:02:36.430> you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
this to like 256m okay and then once you

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.350 
this to like 256m okay and then once you
save<00:02:37.090> those<00:02:37.269> changes<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:38.560> exit<00:02:39.070> out<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.559 
everything is done for the server part
so<00:04:06.290> we<00:04:06.440> can<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.769> ahead<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.090> close<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.330> server

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
so we can go ahead and close the server

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.740 
so we can go ahead and close the server
I'll<00:04:09.260> type<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.040> stop<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.580> then<00:04:10.700> close<00:04:11.030> okay

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
I'll type in stop and then close okay

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.930 
I'll type in stop and then close okay
and<00:04:11.959> now<00:04:12.140> we<00:04:12.200> got<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.680> do<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:13.040> best<00:04:13.280> part<00:04:13.730> of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
and now we got to do the best part of

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.960 
and now we got to do the best part of
the<00:04:14.500> tutorial<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.130> is<00:04:16.310> port<00:04:16.609> forwarding

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
the tutorial and that is port forwarding

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.629 
the tutorial and that is port forwarding
on<00:04:17.090> windows<00:04:17.630> 7<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.109> vista<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:19.160> click<00:04:19.370> start

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
on windows 7 and vista just click start

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.170 
on windows 7 and vista just click start

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
and type in CMD on XP go to run and type

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.830 
and type in CMD on XP go to run and type
CMD<00:04:24.070> okay<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.340> now<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.060> got<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.600> little

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
CMD okay and now you got this little

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.760 
CMD okay and now you got this little
