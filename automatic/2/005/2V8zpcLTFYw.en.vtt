00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
a 50 big blind stack kind of a weaker

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.359 
a 50 big blind stack kind of a weaker
player<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> blinds<00:00:25.079> and<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:26.160> villain

folds to about fifty percent of sea

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.440

cause him to be looser and because of

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.849 
cause him to be looser and because of
that<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.619> gave<00:01:07.859> them<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:09.390> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.719> a<00:01:09.780> range<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.260 

we<00:01:13.859> talked<00:01:14.039> about<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.429> the<00:01:14.729> continuation

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we talked about the the continuation

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.419 
we talked about the the continuation
ranges<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:17.179> give<00:01:18.179> them<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> average<00:01:18.719> range<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
ranges I give them the average range and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.330 
ranges I give them the average range and
I<00:01:20.429> added<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:23.249> King<00:01:23.700> Jack<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.479> ace<00:01:24.929> Jack

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
offsuit to that range because of the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.139 
offsuit to that range because of the
presence<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> fish<00:01:29.249> so<00:01:30.770> now<00:01:32.060> let's<00:01:33.060> look

at<00:01:33.359> our<00:01:33.780> general<00:01:34.109> thought<00:01:34.259> process<00:01:34.619> here<00:01:34.700> good

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
at our general thought process here good

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.169 
at our general thought process here good
let's<00:01:35.850> slide<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.179> here<00:01:36.389> we<00:01:36.749> go<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:38.030> did<00:01:39.030> we

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
let's slide up here we go so did we

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.669 
let's slide up here we go so did we
connect<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:39.600> flop<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.259> answer<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> yes

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
connect with a flop the answer is yes

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.609 
connect with a flop the answer is yes
how<00:01:41.039> strongly<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.759> weakly<00:01:42.139> what<00:01:43.139> range<00:01:43.409> will

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
how strongly very weakly what range will

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.300 
how strongly very weakly what range will
villain<00:01:44.039> continue<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.609> and<00:01:44.819> that<00:01:45.209> is<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
villain continue with and that is the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.669 
villain continue with and that is the
familien<00:01:47.310> dollar<00:01:47.429> question<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.630> let's<00:01:49.409> bring

continue<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.769> he's<00:02:18.769> going<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
continue with that and he's going to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.430 
continue with that and he's going to
let's<00:02:19.940> say<00:02:20.150> he's<00:02:20.299> not<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.629> fold<00:02:20.840> any

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
let's say he's not going to fold any

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440 
let's say he's not going to fold any
kind<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.769> little<00:02:21.980> pair<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.760> includes<00:02:23.150> hearts

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
kind of little pair that includes hearts

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.720 
kind of little pair that includes hearts
so<00:02:24.879> he's<00:02:25.879> going<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.209> continue<00:02:26.450> with<00:02:27.129> five<00:02:28.129> six

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
so he's going to continue with five six

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.100 
so he's going to continue with five six
seven<00:02:29.450> eight<00:02:29.959> nine<00:02:30.739> stens<00:02:31.640> jacks<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.480> heart

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
seven eight nine stens jacks with heart

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:44.039 
seven eight nine stens jacks with heart
so<00:02:33.379> that's<00:02:33.560> 1<00:02:33.860> 2<00:02:33.890> 3<00:02:34.129> 4<00:02:34.610> 5<00:02:35.269> 6<00:02:35.299> 7<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.819> 7<00:02:40.849> times<00:02:41.810> 3

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
so that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so 7 times 3

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.150 
so that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so 7 times 3
combos<00:02:45.049> of<00:02:45.640> hair<00:02:46.640> plus<00:02:47.060> flush<00:02:47.450> draw<00:02:48.160> we're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
combos of hair plus flush draw we're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.140 
combos of hair plus flush draw we're
gonna<00:02:49.250> say<00:02:49.400> he's<00:02:49.489> going<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.700> peel<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.060> them

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
gonna say he's going to peel with them

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.530 
gonna say he's going to peel with them
at<00:02:50.239> least<00:02:50.360> once<00:02:51.640> which<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.970> be<00:02:53.060> 21

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
at least once which is going to be 21

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.920 
at least once which is going to be 21
combinations<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:55.720> um<00:02:58.450> he's<00:02:59.450> going<00:02:59.690> to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
combinations and um he's going to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.210 
combinations and um he's going to
probably<00:03:00.760> call<00:03:01.760> with<00:03:02.030> hand<00:03:02.239> like<00:03:02.329> ace<00:03:02.510> queen

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
probably call with hand like ace queen

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.670 
probably call with hand like ace queen
with<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.579> queen<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.060> hearts<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.230> that's<00:03:06.470> going

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
with the queen of hearts so that's going

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:15.610 
with the queen of hearts so that's going
to<00:03:06.799> be<00:03:07.480> two<00:03:08.480> more<00:03:08.630> combos<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:13.250> ace<00:03:13.910> queen<00:03:14.620> with

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
to be two more combos of ace queen with

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.050 
to be two more combos of ace queen with
queen<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:16.190> hearts<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:18.350> we<00:03:18.889> have<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.069> total<00:03:19.280> of

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.220 

seventy-five<00:03:23.060> combinations<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:24.079> he

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
seventy-five combinations that he

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.879 
seventy-five combinations that he
continues<00:03:24.590> with<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:26.319> appropriately<00:03:27.319> looks

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
continues with and appropriately looks

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:28.990 
continues with and appropriately looks
like<00:03:28.069> he's<00:03:28.280> going<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.489> be<00:03:28.549> folding<00:03:28.819> about

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
like he's going to be folding about

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.500 
like he's going to be folding about
fifty<00:03:29.480> percent<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.900> time<00:03:30.079> so<00:03:31.359> if<00:03:32.359> he's

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
fifty percent of the time so if he's

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.460 
fifty percent of the time so if he's
going<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.720> be<00:03:32.780> folding<00:03:33.049> about<00:03:33.200> fifty<00:03:33.440> percent

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
going to be folding about fifty percent

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.809 
going to be folding about fifty percent
of<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.859> time<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:36.560> there<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.459> bet<00:03:37.549> going<00:03:37.579> to

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
of the time and is there a bet going to

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.620 
of the time and is there a bet going to
be<00:03:38.090> plus<00:03:38.480> EV<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:40.970> could<00:03:41.120> probably<00:03:41.329> bet

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
be plus EV so you could probably bet

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.809 
be plus EV so you could probably bet
like<00:03:41.780> half<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.530> pot<00:03:42.769> here<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:46.340> one<00:03:46.609> and

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
like half the pot here and be one and

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.909 
like half the pot here and be one and
done<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:48.260> problem<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.739> if<00:03:48.950> he<00:03:49.370> does<00:03:49.669> call<00:03:50.060> and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
done the problem is if he does call and

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.020 
done the problem is if he does call and
we're<00:03:51.919> just<00:03:52.130> shutting<00:03:52.280> down<00:03:52.549> on<00:03:52.790> anything

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
we're just shutting down on anything

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.640 
we're just shutting down on anything
that's<00:03:53.329> not<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.599> for<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.910> probably<00:03:56.690> bet<00:03:57.290> an<00:03:57.500> ace

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
that's not a for we probably bet an ace

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.640 
that's not a for we probably bet an ace
again<00:03:58.389> but<00:03:59.389> I<00:03:59.419> think<00:03:59.599> everything<00:03:59.900> else<00:04:00.109> we<00:04:00.440> are

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
again but I think everything else we are

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.190 
again but I think everything else we are
going<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.160> be<00:04:01.400> well<00:04:01.700> we<00:04:02.569> can<00:04:02.720> bet<00:04:02.870> we<00:04:02.989> can<00:04:03.079> buy

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
going to be well we can bet we can buy

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.800 
going to be well we can bet we can buy
two<00:04:03.260> queen<00:04:03.650> too<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:05.120> let's<00:04:05.419> let's<00:04:05.569> write<00:04:05.780> that

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
two queen too so let's let's write that

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.149 
two queen too so let's let's write that
down<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.500> any<00:04:06.709> for

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
down so any for

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.970 
down so any for
any<00:04:10.349> any<00:04:11.349> a's<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.250> i<00:04:13.090> might<00:04:13.540> or<00:04:13.750> might<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:14.620> bet

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
any any a's and i might or might not bet

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.890 
any any a's and i might or might not bet
a<00:04:15.010> queen<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:15.819> in<00:04:16.000> general<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.479> would<00:04:16.510> say<00:04:16.660> this

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
a queen but in general I would say this

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.780 
a queen but in general I would say this
is<00:04:16.959> just<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.380> very<00:04:17.709> much<00:04:18.160> like<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> one-and-done

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
is just a very much like a one-and-done

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.900 
is just a very much like a one-and-done
scenario<00:04:19.389> in<00:04:19.510> this<00:04:19.630> situation
