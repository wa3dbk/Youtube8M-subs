price I think it's a very good bye
especially<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.290> again<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> slot<00:02:24.490> on

this from a computer to a wall charger

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.220 
this from a computer to a wall charger
another<00:02:31.060> cool<00:02:31.270> benefit<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.840> this<00:02:31.990> is<00:02:32.050> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
another cool benefit of this is that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.930 
another cool benefit of this is that
lets<00:02:32.650> say<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.860> want<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> charge<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:33.880> a

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
case which is usually how I wrote with

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.880 
case which is usually how I wrote with
my<00:02:36.550> phones<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.570> removable<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.560> can

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
my phones this is removable so you can

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.610 
my phones this is removable so you can
take<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.730> mount<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.780> device<00:02:41.200> with

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
cases out of there if it's too thing is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.600 
cases out of there if it's too thing is
not<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.200> fit<00:02:47.440> for<00:02:47.800> example<00:02:48.130> other<00:02:48.250> case

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
not going to fit for example other case

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.160 
not going to fit for example other case
in<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.820> phone<00:02:49.000> which<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.300> don't<00:02:49.540> like<00:02:49.750> removing

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
in the phone which I don't like removing

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.750 
in the phone which I don't like removing
when<00:02:50.620> charging<00:02:51.190> or<00:02:51.340> anything<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:51.640> that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
when charging or anything like that

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
when charging or anything like that
that's<00:02:52.000> why<00:02:52.150> i<00:02:52.180> don't<00:02:52.450> use<00:02:52.630> credits<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.110> lot<00:02:53.290> but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
that's why i don't use credits a lot but

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
that's why i don't use credits a lot but
what<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.190> do<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.730> remove<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.180> little

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
what you do is just remove this little

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.780 
what you do is just remove this little
part<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.380> gives<00:02:56.560> way<00:02:56.769> more<00:02:57.010> room<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.519> that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
part and it gives way more room so that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.990 
part and it gives way more room so that
way<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.660> goes<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.140> no<00:02:59.709> problem<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.220> all<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
way it goes in no problem at all the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.540 
way it goes in no problem at all the
fitment<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.510> very<00:03:01.720> good<00:03:01.989> with<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.530> case<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.100> i

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
fitment is very good with the case and i

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.490 
fitment is very good with the case and i
can<00:03:03.790> see<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.330> fits<00:03:04.600> actually<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.050> thicker

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
can see that it fits actually a thicker

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.800 
can see that it fits actually a thicker
case<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.790> test<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.269> see<00:03:07.480> which<00:03:07.630> one

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
case you can test your can see which one

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.290 
case you can test your can see which one
works<00:03:07.959> for<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.320> my<00:03:08.920> TPU<00:03:09.580> case<00:03:09.850> works

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
works for you my TPU case works

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.180 
works for you my TPU case works
perfectly<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.230> i<00:03:11.470> think<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> great
