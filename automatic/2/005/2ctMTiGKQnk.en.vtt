00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 what my ancestors Cossacks find out 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:41.480
 the true version I came dry 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.510
 rivers at fifteen forty centigrade 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 there was once our farm and now 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.879
 tubercles to sadochka and now crosshair 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.580
 roads going to the horizon 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.059
 my ancestors have lived here since childhood 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.760
 put the cutting of brushwood and then to whom 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.740
 must have served up to mid crisis 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.190
 age on halts jam cooked and in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.070
 hikes went with singing with them any enemy 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.460
 talked like a strong artisan 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 with genius 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.960
 where will the flags lie there with that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.110
 other people's speech turns everything after 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.560
 booze in the hostel institute friendship on 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.330
 role 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.610
 I stand and juice balls neither water nor frogs 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.940
 not sharply where the people that hacked into two hands 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.180
 took Siberia came to the forest where all those who 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.229
 in the endless battle to China Russia 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.250
 spread apart 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.630
 why I am standing here today without one 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 unnamed land 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.530
 and look at the thorn bush rock on aspen 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 what between my daughters 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:06.340
 alarmist but a crown of thorns and an aspen stake 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:10.429
 whistles I put a cross at home 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:15.060
 let it stand here as delusion as 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:18.060
 the final chord of these places is like a parody 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
 rebirth 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.210
 I represent the past century 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.560
 right now 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:41.420
 we sat like I am Kazakh Batko Ermak 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.760
 and the night comes and the day comes Adam 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.709

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.730
 again east means ours 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:05.510

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.160

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.829

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.740

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.460
 I will remember how I fought on the edge 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.060

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.500
