00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
sound and it would be easier for their

cable the seventh fret the two chords

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.229 
cable the seventh fret the two chords
will<00:00:33.690> work<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.110> our<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.980> basic<00:00:35.370> ecord<00:00:36.000> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
will work with our your basic ecord if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.810 
will work with our your basic ecord if
we<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> cable<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.460> open

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we think of the cable as the open

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.330 
we think of the cable as the open

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
pointer finger is going to brush against

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.949 
pointer finger is going to brush against
your<00:02:11.269> three<00:02:12.200> finished<00:02:12.620> strengths<00:02:13.370> your<00:02:13.959> the

your three finished strengths your the
fingers<00:02:15.290> are<00:02:15.410> moving<00:02:15.670> sympathetically<00:02:16.670> they

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
fingers are moving sympathetically they

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.350 
fingers are moving sympathetically they
don't<00:02:16.910> need<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.120> go<00:02:17.239> all<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.599> way<00:02:18.010> but<00:02:19.010> if<00:02:19.819> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
don't need to go all the way but if you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.430 
don't need to go all the way but if you
try<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.569> keep<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.140> way<00:02:21.230> that's

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
try to keep them all the way that's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.630 
try to keep them all the way that's
going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> create<00:02:21.769> some<00:02:22.160> ten<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.519> can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
going to create some ten you can

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.890 
going to create some ten you can
actually<00:02:22.730> feel<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.269> if<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> hold<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> other

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
actually feel that if you hold the other

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.059 
actually feel that if you hold the other
fingers<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.470> move<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.769> pointer

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
fingers in and you move the pointer

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.740 
fingers in and you move the pointer
finger<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.819> can<00:02:25.970> feel<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.299> tension<00:02:26.329> you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
finger you can feel the tension you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
finger you can feel the tension you
create<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:31.129> your<00:02:31.250> down<00:02:31.459> stroke<00:02:31.910> by

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
create so that's your down stroke by

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.430 
create so that's your down stroke by
opening<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> hand<00:02:32.870> next<00:02:33.200> thing<00:02:33.290> you're<00:02:33.350> gonna

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
opening the hand next thing you're gonna

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.650 
opening the hand next thing you're gonna
do<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.650> you're<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.549> to<00:02:34.609> close<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.120> hand<00:02:35.329> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
do is you're going to close the hand and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.229 
do is you're going to close the hand and
you're<00:02:35.959> going<00:02:36.079> to<00:02:36.139> brush<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.700> three<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.090> is

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
you're going to brush the three that is

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.160 
you're going to brush the three that is
strength<00:02:38.420> or<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.660> other<00:02:38.810> side<00:02:39.079> of<00:02:39.109> the<00:02:39.290> nail

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
strength or the other side of the nail

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.780 
strength or the other side of the nail
so<00:02:42.170> example<00:02:42.650> 1<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:42.799> this<00:02:43.040> little<00:02:43.220> alternation

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
so example 1 we this little alternation

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.600 
so example 1 we this little alternation
going

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.220 

if<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.000> could<00:02:54.300> change<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.930> F

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
if you like you could change to that F

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:05.140 
if you like you could change to that F
chord<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.150> flamenco<00:02:57.150> f

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.910 

let's<00:03:05.780> get<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> hang<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.439> you<00:03:06.739> don't

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
let's get the hang of that you don't

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.679 
let's get the hang of that you don't
really<00:03:07.099> need<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.459> brace<00:03:07.700> your<00:03:07.909> thumb<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
really need to brace your thumb all the

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.539 
really need to brace your thumb all the
time<00:03:08.870> which<00:03:09.019> means<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.409> could<00:03:09.560> blue<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.310> will

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
time which means you could blue it will

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.619 
time which means you could blue it will
six<00:03:10.939> straight<00:03:11.269> no<00:03:12.250> variation<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.629> example

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
six straight no variation of example

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:24.800 
six straight no variation of example
once<00:03:14.840> were<00:03:15.110> playing<00:03:15.439> all<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.920> strike

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.289 

okay<00:03:25.810> for<00:03:26.110> example<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:27.090> we're<00:03:28.090> going<00:03:28.239> to

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
okay for example to we're going to

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.780 
okay for example to we're going to
incorporate<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.709> rest<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.189> fingers<00:03:30.400> on

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
incorporate the rest of the fingers on

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.280 
incorporate the rest of the fingers on
the<00:03:31.090> right<00:03:31.239> hand<00:03:31.420> not<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.930> thumb<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.200> have

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the right hand not to the thumb you have

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.920 
the right hand not to the thumb you have
the<00:03:32.500> rest<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.829> fingers<00:03:33.750> we're<00:03:34.750> going<00:03:34.870> to

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
the rest of the fingers we're going to

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.690 
the rest of the fingers we're going to
start<00:03:35.140> in<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.349> similar<00:03:36.159> position<00:03:36.250> basically

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
start in a similar position basically

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.179 
start in a similar position basically
making<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.150> fist<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.959> might<00:03:38.140> rest<00:03:38.620> your<00:03:38.860> thumb

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
making a fist you might rest your thumb

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.149 
making a fist you might rest your thumb
on<00:03:39.459> your<00:03:39.549> low<00:03:40.450> E<00:03:40.480> string<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.470> get<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.739> hands<00:03:41.920> at

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
on your low E string to get the hands at

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.640 
on your low E string to get the hands at
first<00:03:42.400> you're<00:03:42.879> going<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.200> open<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.470> send

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
first you're going to open up and send

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.210 
first you're going to open up and send
on<00:03:44.739> your<00:03:44.950> pinky<00:03:45.790> finger<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.920> was<00:03:48.040> like<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
on your pinky finger it was like a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.670 
on your pinky finger it was like a
little<00:03:48.280> smoothly<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.440> ring<00:03:50.650> finger

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
little smoothly and the ring finger

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.819 
little smoothly and the ring finger
middle<00:03:51.329> finger<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> motor<00:03:54.099> finger<00:03:54.489> I

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
middle finger that the motor finger I

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.710 
middle finger that the motor finger I
example<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:58.180> can<00:03:58.329> think<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.659> a

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
example to you can think that as a

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.660 
example to you can think that as a
triplet<00:03:59.200> like

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.590 

eventually<00:04:07.670> we<00:04:07.760> want<00:04:07.940> to<00:04:08.000> do<00:04:08.090> those<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.450> want

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
eventually we want to do those you want

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.320 
eventually we want to do those you want
to<00:04:08.660> create<00:04:08.840> what<00:04:09.110> drummers<00:04:09.500> call<00:04:09.740> a<00:04:10.010> flam<00:04:10.820> the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
to create what drummers call a flam the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.370 
to create what drummers call a flam the
flam<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:12.020> when<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.740> have<00:04:14.440> two<00:04:15.440> or<00:04:15.770> more

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
flam is when you have two or more

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.949 
flam is when you have two or more
different<00:04:18.380> attacks<00:04:18.920> or<00:04:19.489> articulations<00:04:20.480> that

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
different attacks or articulations that

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.630 
different attacks or articulations that
are<00:04:21.049> happening<00:04:21.140> very<00:04:21.470> close<00:04:22.070> together<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
are happening very close together and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.810 
are happening very close together and
creates<00:04:22.940> out<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.570> very<00:04:24.050> fat<00:04:24.560> thick<00:04:25.370> attack

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
creates out of a very fat thick attack

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.940 
creates out of a very fat thick attack
so<00:04:26.750> instead<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.650> one<00:04:29.620> you're<00:04:30.620> more<00:04:30.830> or

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
so instead of the one you're more or

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.740 
so instead of the one you're more or
less<00:04:31.070> say<00:04:31.280> them<00:04:31.520> together<00:04:31.910> but<00:04:32.210> just<00:04:32.390> played

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
less say them together but just played

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.360 
less say them together but just played
slightly<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:34.720> could<00:04:35.720> stop<00:04:36.040> arresting<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
slightly I could stop arresting the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:48.020 
slightly I could stop arresting the
thumb<00:04:37.670> on<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.210> low<00:04:38.750> E<00:04:38.780> string<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:43.160> slowly

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:05:06.580 

or<00:04:49.030> all<00:04:49.300> together<00:04:51.540> between<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.660> cord

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.080 

when<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.740> do<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.099> in<00:05:08.220> real<00:05:08.250> life<00:05:08.490> other<00:05:08.880> than

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.219 

okay<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:15.270> example<00:05:15.330> three<00:05:15.840> we're<00:05:16.050> going<00:05:16.169> to

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
okay for example three we're going to

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.939 
okay for example three we're going to
combine<00:05:16.380> example<00:05:17.160> one<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.819> example<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.960> the

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
combine example one and example to the

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.290 
combine example one and example to the
first<00:05:20.190> thing<00:05:20.310> we'll<00:05:20.430> do<00:05:20.550> is<00:05:20.580> we'll<00:05:20.819> do<00:05:20.970> exactly

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
first thing we'll do is we'll do exactly

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.499 
first thing we'll do is we'll do exactly
we<00:05:21.569> just<00:05:21.599> did<00:05:21.840> an<00:05:21.960> example<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:23.030> then<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.240> or

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
we just did an example to then you or

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.740 
we just did an example to then you or
like<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.169> then<00:05:25.740> we'll<00:05:26.280> pull<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
like that and then we'll pull the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.990 
like that and then we'll pull the
pointer<00:05:27.750> finger<00:05:28.139> and<00:05:28.280> back<00:05:29.280> trust<00:05:29.639> string

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
pointer finger and back trust string

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.809 
pointer finger and back trust string
like<00:05:30.150> we<00:05:30.270> did<00:05:30.419> in<00:05:30.539> example<00:05:31.020> 1<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:32.069> then<00:05:32.250> down

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
like we did in example 1 and then down

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.749 
like we did in example 1 and then down
the<00:05:33.780> corner<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.470> value<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.639> like

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
the corner of the value so it's like

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:46.999 
the corner of the value so it's like
down<00:05:36.030> all<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:37.039> uploader<00:05:45.830> struck<00:05:46.830> from

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
down all the uploader struck from

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.230 
down all the uploader struck from
example<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:49.370> emphasis<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.639> could<00:05:50.819> use<00:05:51.000> those

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
example to emphasis you could use those

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.320 
example to emphasis you could use those
less<00:05:51.930> often<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.710> build<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.250> tension<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.909> the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
less often to build the tension and the

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.290 
less often to build the tension and the
more<00:05:54.569> two<00:05:54.750> more<00:05:55.349> often<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:56.759> a<00:05:56.880> sort<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.180> an

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
more two more often in a sort of an

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:11.490 
more two more often in a sort of an
explosive<00:05:57.960> ways

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.480 

the

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:22.689 
the
so<00:06:14.270> that's<00:06:14.479> just<00:06:14.569> fighting<00:06:16.240> using<00:06:21.220> as<00:06:22.220> a<00:06:22.250> clam

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
so that's just fighting using as a clam

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.200 
so that's just fighting using as a clam
the<00:06:23.539> little<00:06:24.199> finger

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.150 

for<00:06:28.210> example<00:06:28.600> for<00:06:29.140> will<00:06:29.470> get<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.890> thumb

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
for example for will get the thumb

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.680 
for example for will get the thumb
involved<00:06:30.730> here's<00:06:31.240> what<00:06:31.330> we're<00:06:31.420> going<00:06:31.510> to<00:06:31.600> do

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
involved here's what we're going to do

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.600 
involved here's what we're going to do
imagine<00:06:32.170> you're<00:06:32.290> turning<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.740> doorknob<00:06:33.070> that's

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
imagine you're turning a doorknob that's

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.250 
imagine you're turning a doorknob that's
basically<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.240> motion<00:06:34.690> that<00:06:34.810> you're<00:06:34.960> making

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
basically the motion that you're making

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:42.960 
basically the motion that you're making
it<00:06:35.320> with<00:06:35.410> your<00:06:35.560> thumb<00:06:35.590> here<00:06:41.820> after<00:06:42.820> you<00:06:42.880> do

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
it with your thumb here after you do

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.300 
it with your thumb here after you do
that<00:06:43.000> you<00:06:43.210> extend<00:06:43.810> your<00:06:44.020> ring<00:06:44.710> finger<00:06:44.950> just

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
that you extend your ring finger just

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.450 
that you extend your ring finger just
like<00:06:45.400> you<00:06:45.580> did<00:06:45.670> it<00:06:45.820> strong<00:06:47.160> just<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.280> right

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
like you did it strong just the right

00:06:48.460 --> 00:07:05.390 
like you did it strong just the right
fan

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.080
