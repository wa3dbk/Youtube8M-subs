00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
getting that that sporty look you also

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
getting that that sporty look you also
get<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> performance<00:01:43.770> too<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.909> comes<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
get the performance too it comes in

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999

three<00:01:45.299> different<00:01:45.540> colors<00:01:45.899> red<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.680> black

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
three different colors red and black

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.690 
three different colors red and black
gray<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.619> favorite<00:01:50.130> without<00:01:50.399> doubt

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
gray and this my favorite without doubt

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.870 
gray and this my favorite without doubt
the<00:01:50.729> beautiful<00:01:51.680> MotoGP<00:01:52.680> blue<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.610> runs

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the beautiful MotoGP blue which runs

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.120 
the beautiful MotoGP blue which runs
throughout<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> Suzuki<00:01:55.170> range<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.500> 2015<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
throughout the Suzuki range for 2015 and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.649 
throughout the Suzuki range for 2015 and
really<00:01:56.520> finishes<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.969> off<00:01:57.030> nicely<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.509> think

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.429 

now<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> amount<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.320> horsepower

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
now with that amount of horsepower

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
now with that amount of horsepower
propelling<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> forward<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.210> need

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
propelling you forward you also need

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300 
propelling you forward you also need
something<00:02:03.689> pretty<00:02:03.899> serious<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:05.159> your

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
something pretty serious to get your

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
something pretty serious to get your
stops<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.969> thing<00:02:06.149> does<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> job<00:02:06.719> with

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
stops and this thing does the job with

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.199 
stops and this thing does the job with
the<00:02:07.439> Brembo<00:02:07.770> monoblock<00:02:08.340> single<00:02:08.759> color<00:02:08.940> foot

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the Brembo monoblock single color foot

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
the Brembo monoblock single color foot
on<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.720> front<00:02:09.959> also<00:02:10.229> new<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.410> 2015<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
on the front also new for 2015 is the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.390 
on the front also new for 2015 is the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
ABS

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
ABS

of<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.760> front<00:02:15.790> wheel<00:02:16.299> so<00:02:16.569> pretty<00:02:16.840> impressive

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
of the front wheel so pretty impressive

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.069 
of the front wheel so pretty impressive
stuff<00:02:17.549> beautifully<00:02:18.549> stylized<00:02:19.000> from<00:02:19.689> real<00:02:19.870> as

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
stuff beautifully stylized from real as

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.300 
stuff beautifully stylized from real as
well<00:02:20.349> one<00:02:20.590> thing<00:02:20.709> I<00:02:20.799> didn't<00:02:20.950> mention<00:02:20.980> before

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
well one thing I didn't mention before

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.920 
well one thing I didn't mention before
actually<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.209> fat<00:02:22.420> bar<00:02:22.629> as<00:02:22.750> well

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
actually was that the fat bar as well

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.449 
actually was that the fat bar as well
which<00:02:23.110> gives<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.409> a<00:02:23.530> real<00:02:23.680> nice<00:02:24.159> aggressive

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
which gives it a real nice aggressive

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.910 
which gives it a real nice aggressive
look<00:02:24.819> on<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> front<00:02:25.920> electronically

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
look on the front electronically

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
look on the front electronically
speaking<00:02:27.000> keeping<00:02:28.000> all<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.150> power<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.720> check

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
speaking keeping all that power in check

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.319 
speaking keeping all that power in check
is<00:02:29.140> ultimately<00:02:29.530> important<00:02:30.099> on<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:30.280> back<00:02:30.519> this

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
is ultimately important on the back this

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.990 
is ultimately important on the back this
has<00:02:31.510> got<00:02:31.689> three<00:02:31.900> more<00:02:32.170> traction<00:02:32.500> control<00:02:33.000> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
has got three more traction control with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.149 
has got three more traction control with
sensors<00:02:34.329> all<00:02:34.480> over<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.780> bike<00:02:34.930> taking<00:02:35.319> 250

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
sensors all over the bike taking 250

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.880 
sensors all over the bike taking 250
readings<00:02:36.790> per<00:02:37.390> second<00:02:37.989> hopefully<00:02:38.709> that's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
readings per second hopefully that's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.580 
readings per second hopefully that's
enough<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.609> keep<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.939> on<00:02:40.090> board<00:02:40.349> now<00:02:41.349> did<00:02:41.530> I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
enough to keep you on board now did I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.619 
enough to keep you on board now did I
sound<00:02:41.829> like<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.129> blue<00:02:42.400> earlier<00:02:43.090> I'm<00:02:43.390> not<00:02:43.569> sure

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
sound like the blue earlier I'm not sure

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.899 
sound like the blue earlier I'm not sure
you<00:02:44.019> know<00:02:44.170> pretty<00:02:44.950> much<00:02:45.099> like<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.579> red<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
you know pretty much like this red and

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.480 
you know pretty much like this red and
black<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:46.269> well
