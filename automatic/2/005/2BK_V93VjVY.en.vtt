 this video contains the suggested steps 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.650
 to initiate the processing of a 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.010
 Entry point for taxonomy 01 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.060
 end of year financial statements 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.260
 includes the definition of the date of 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 cut with which the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.860
 information the completion of the 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.900
 gland the 1st storage of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.940
 file after evidencing the nyt and 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.860
 the cutoff date to perform the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.110
 licensing is necessary to execute it 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.450
 xb the expression 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 once started it must be accessed by the 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.120
 File menu and select the option 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.120
 new report 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.070
 2 taxonomies will be deployed 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.350
 currently available in this case is 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.060
 will select according to financial statements 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 end of year 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 subsequently the entry point that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 correspond for each case in the example 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 we will select the entry point 10 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.090
 nor individual plenas and click on 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090
 the xy button 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 Once the taxonomy is loaded , 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.950
 will request the entry of the nyt this one should 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.479
 differentiate with the 9 digits without 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.000
 points or hyphens or digits of 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.040
 check 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420
 seconds after unfolding the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.980
 structure of the first form that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 make up the report 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.330
 in this case the form character under 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 the action buttons is the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.500
 row with same name when located on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 is a row the list of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.760
 forms that make up the report the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 first option on the list indicates all

 cutting dates and comparatives 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.420
 it is necessary to be for this option and there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.040
 by the column button 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.840
 a new window will be displayed with the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.299
 list of columns or tokens that are 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.040
 associated with the report first by 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.159
 to do in this window is to eliminate 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.690
 instants or dates and durations or years 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.380
 that do not apply 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.819
 in this case 2013 December 31 and press 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.969
 the remove button in the same way with 2013 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.889
 then pressing the button add locating 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.049
 those on the calendar we will add the 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:24.970
 instant of comparison that in this case 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.280
 corresponds to January first of 2014 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.280
 and click on the ok button 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.430
 should be then the columns 2014 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.290
 December 31 2014 and 2014 January first 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.329
 to confirm that the dates will be 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.609
 properly selected we can 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.900
 access the cover form in 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:56.879
 duration must indicate 2014 and in a moment 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.879
 2014 December 32 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 the form status statement 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.830

 indicate if it shows inconsistencies and 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.310
 the amount of them 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.140
 the messages corresponding to each 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.450
