00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and so here we left at last already on 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.450
 the track is such a track about 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 the cities checked the absence of galtsev and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.809
 we want to show what car can 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 the banks you have lived the absence is ready for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 never breaking yes for 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 not to violate in any way 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 but the bottom line is what we want now 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.500
 show really exactly how 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 heels car as she rides already in 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.900
 aggressive ranges and proper 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.559
 now we will show this sport mode 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.649
 self boxed sport switch 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.129
 forgot he forgot we didn't forget 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.129
 rode choked 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.769
 Well, there is 5000 rpm of course yes already 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.769
 heard 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.920
 but the most important thing is the entry into 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
 turn it on 130 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 that's how the car fights so that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.970
 never start diagonally 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.480
 swing so that she was not 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.480
 Divert 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.470
 into the stream is not fat 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.130
 Well, that is, here and so the car goes on 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.990
 ceiling is a sport mode 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 speed we already have there a hundred and forty with 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 small to 50 to 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.299
 time is now pretty 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.450
 good road in terms of what she 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.450
 hot she can 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020
 here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.880
 mode and throw off momentum 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.250
 announcements absolutely 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.630
 no 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.630
 no discomfort zubovo 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.870
 also for the audience now I want to draw 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.629
 attention is what we have here first 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.150
 shows instant consumption but this 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.239
 once the move is not in liters per 100 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.140
 kilometers and here goes kilometers on 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.629
 liter yes that is 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.860
 shows how many kilometers we can 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:48.420
 drive one liter 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:53.430
 arabic joke and again here's 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.950
 this car was once such a system 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 overspeed alarm 120 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.540
 kilometers per hour we make a reservation that this 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.660
 present in all arab car 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.450
 that is, both on the truth and on all sorts 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.819
 Lexus and so on in any we will 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.840
 keep this in mind legislation by you 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.390
 such goods are forbidden to sell 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.310
 cars quiz sensation of violation 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.640
 I will say a word 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.480
 and they have a speed limit of 120 km per hour 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.250
 everywhere 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.220
 so 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.240
 that then it was ever the same 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.510
 egypt a lot of peace then there egypt in my opinion 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.180
 exactly the same are given 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.120
 genetics for firewood drove there shahid 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.120
 local houses make sure water 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.150
 that i need this myself 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.340
 how is the stadium coming back again 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.970
 that the car is good, that is, the suspension 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.440
 tough but if you know the limit and know 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.440
 correct passing speeds 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.170
 now I strain any special for 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.690
 set 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.010
 no enemies run in the same suit on 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.959
 however with a porous cloth riding 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.510
 we go down you did not pass clearly the substitution 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.110
 always thundered that is not important quickly and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.100
 the Swedes are accelerating we slowed down 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.079
 always makeup I also noticed it by the way 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.870
 yes that is when you say that you have 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.490
 there for example but it seems that something 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.840
 somewhere somewhere somehow somehow 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.550
 by glitch really you 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.620
 find fault why because i'm well 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.810
 when the salad went we drove hundreds and 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.060
 very fast and speed modes and in 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.010
 gently and slowly, and on a bad road is 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.639
 there is, in principle, we have never here yet 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.490
 one so many have not heard 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:46.490
 if we allow the pit to pass that is 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.160
 one must either lie down very slowly 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.320
 either quickly then I hear nothing here 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.830
 there is such a speed when there is 40 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.650
 or 50 when a bad road starts 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.720
 here it is under the wheels then of course 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.419
 not very nice though in principle again 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.430
 is this a matter of habit and now 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.219
 we also went, in general, I, too, on 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.419
 really really now 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:16.489
 did not notice terribly 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.489
 here we are 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.090
 Inga 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:28.900
 pilgrimage 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.580
 run across or dear the temple do lago see 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.190
 there are also many pilgrims in the park 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.760
 The numbers go a little further when 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:42.700
 I strain I here already hold in their 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:46.420
 to fight a good impression was 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.600
 car and by the way she sold that car 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:56.620
 now sorry to part with a good horse 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:06:00.910
 which one is interested in the shop 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.860
 in Ukraine and preferably on Petrovka 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.550
 areas 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.550
 so that they could not 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.100
 everyone will 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.740
 but the most important thing is that firstly the car 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.530
 worthy in the second operation such 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.090
 correct and reliable and good and good 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.889
 the owner is I already say that I 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.000
 a little bit familiar with the way they lead now 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.600
 outbid yourself 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.680
 and how truthful and honest sellers 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.080
 cars 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.630
 I read somewhere for some reason 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.090
 there statistics cant refer to 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.590
 source because stupidly don't remember in 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 general was held some 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.340
 research what sellers really are 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.599
 cars are the most dishonest people in 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.090
 the world is convenient to have them even by the way in my 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:52.030
 some share Norwegian like this 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.770
 European saying means gave 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.669
 trust the person that is 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.250
 question you get it man 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:04.330
 ask so ask and would buy 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.220
 you have a used car in it 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.490
 says a lot it's ready to buy something 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:13.599
 gentle such chuck on the frame you can 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.280
 trust and something more we can in 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:18.000
 This series is shorter and then along Ushinsky and 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.000
 Immediately we are in place
