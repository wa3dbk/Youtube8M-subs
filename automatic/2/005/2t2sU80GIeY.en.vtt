00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:15.340
 we are working to reach the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 match of day 28 in the city ​​of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.669
 medellin 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.699
 working as we did throughout 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:26.609
 the throughout the year in this second 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 semester waiting and trusting that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.769
 things are going to come out of the best 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.890
 way for oil america and rionegro 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.800
 according to you are similar teams are 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.579
 different and yes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.079
 depending on one of the two you 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 make changes to your information that is me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.949
 I explain if outside if I were to rionegro 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.230
 you have a group if it were 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.220
 petrolatina other or likewise the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.339
 will face in the same way they are very 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.180
 similar in their way of 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.680
 I work because they work in court 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.790
 synthetic the back court team 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.829
 synthetic always has very good 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.420
 position because you're hardly going to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.070
 lift the ball in a court of that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 where is it so fast because they always go 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.470
 to try to play down play the floor 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.470
 then that's where they are 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.510
 the heart of the matter that no no 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.220
 manage not to get the ball and 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.540
 force a team that is not taught 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.150
 to play long to be played by another 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 way and the other difference that the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.410
 one of the other is that but black suddenly 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.660
 has more position than the ball is more 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.820
 tired the other has very players 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.200
 fast at the tips and that's where it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.150
 can do can already be harm 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.440
 pronounced correcting the part of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.880
 back to try that the team does not 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.040
 learn as many valences as do 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.360
 for a second party 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.130
 you need what you always want 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.130
 there are no mistakes in defense 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.310
 keep your arc at zero but before a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.530
 error of some players as happened to us in 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 popayán where they know and doing things 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.470
 ok for 89 90 minutes in the minute 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.660
 91 made a mistake is that it is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.310
 there goal is impossible but that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.530
 work is worked and you want to correct 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.960
 provided that we do here 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.130
 every day we can give you the fact 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.259
 of what we see in practice 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.150
 rotation of the team that aims or what 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.180
 what happens because we are looking 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.099
 We are watching watching 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.409
 what is the group that the payroll we're going 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.650
 to pay and I believe that each and every one 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.390
 have the same wishes and 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.069
 same conditions to want to be 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.230
 between the eleven because if we are rotating 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.230
 we are looking to see what will be the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 eleven ideal because here the eleven is those that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 best are in their time
