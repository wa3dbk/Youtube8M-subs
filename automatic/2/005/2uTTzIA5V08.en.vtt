00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.449
 always think about a dessert is to think about 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.359
 have so much sugar that's why 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.359
 coffee is crowned has thought of you with 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.390
 50% less sugar in this cajeta 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.879
 to prepare together a custard for 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.879
 which I need to put to heat milk 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.140
 I'm going to infuse you with peel 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.090
 orange a lot of eye always the part 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.180
 white must be removed from any 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.620
 citrus because that's what bitter and 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.350
 that's why suddenly there are people who do not 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 like lemon or dessert desserts 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.580
 any citrus because they always have 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 yellow notes is precisely why 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.640
 leave the white part of the skin so 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.530
 remember only the color part 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.860
 where you have all the essential oils 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.310
 loaded with a very rich aromas 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 I have here egg yolks starch I'm going 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.820
 to mix 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.570
 and it's time to add our 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.500
 protagonist of today 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.500
 the card with 50% less sugar 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 and a very good amount 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.170
 we can accompany it with custard 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.229
 seasonal fruit I can think of if it is 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 mamey mango season comes 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.850
 very well and if not then the red fruits 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 They are always a very good ally in everything 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.140
 this type of preparations 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.030
 and once it's boiled I'm going to 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.310
 tempering equals the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.040
 temperatures to be able to return to the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.039
 fire and finish the cooking we are going to 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 have a very unctuous texture very 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.039
 creamy that we can well put in 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.019
 drinks for some planet and we have very 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.640
 alright so I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.210
 my milk 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.210
 here 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.010
 I mix 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.550
 to temper as well I told you and 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.730
 I return in the fire to finish the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.730
 cooking 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 all the cart that stays at the bottom 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.890
 she is also invited to this feast 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.750
 and here as I have the starch I can make 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.689
 a very good cooking helping me 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.299
 balloon beater looks nothing more than the texture 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.030
 that begins to take approach and look 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.569
 how thick it has a very cute 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.579
 golden color and of course a delicious 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.010
 taste because although we have done it with 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.159
 the cajeta that has 50% less sugar 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.079
 the taste is exactly the same as 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.069
 cajeta burned 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.590
 identical I already have the point is already good 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.769
 This quote means that the starch is already 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 he cooked so he put out fire and I'm going to 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.409
 strain it to remove the skin from 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.590
 orange with which we gave him all the 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.590
 to Rome 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.750
 see nothing but delight and if you could 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.130
 smell it 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 well we emptied in a dram 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.810
 or it can be in a large cup in what 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.250
 you want to present it is perfect I 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.040
 this time, it occurred to me 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.830
 do it in a cup individually 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.040
 as if it were dessert way and very 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.250
 important is that we do not cover 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.250
 immediately but let's leave it 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.980
 cool completely before covering it 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.980
 with some film to prevent it from 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.220
 sweat and drop all those droplets 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.500
 of evaporation in our custard if 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.020
 we put mamey if we put fruits 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 red the fruit that is better with your 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.240
 dealer that is the one that must be put 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.400
 how I'm going to decorate red berries 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.670
 because those are not lost to all the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.950
 world loves a mint leaf and 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.440
 with that we're going to finish presenting the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.650
 always cost mint leaves and the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.370
 peppermint and organic flowers then 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.689
 they give a lot of life and a lot of freshness to all 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.149
 our hamburger desserts 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:38.899
 Bloomberg and strawberry blackberry go very well 

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.899
 with this post 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.610
 So here it is made with 100% 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.490
 cajeta crowned 50% less sugar but 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.080
 which has exactly the same delicious 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.020
 flavor I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.750
 as much as me and as always sweets 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.750
 kisses with a lot of flavor to cajeta coronado
