now take care that the oil doesn't get

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.140 
now take care that the oil doesn't get
too<00:02:27.940> hot<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.990> does<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.760> bring<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.910> pan

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
too hot if it does just bring the pan

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.490 
too hot if it does just bring the pan
off<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.720> direct<00:02:32.020> heat<00:02:33.960> makes<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> very<00:02:35.260> easy

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
off the direct heat makes it very easy

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.880 
off the direct heat makes it very easy
to<00:02:35.680> control<00:02:35.860> temperature<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:36.580> way<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.710> once

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
to control temperature this way so once

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.040 
to control temperature this way so once
they're<00:02:39.070> nice<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.250> golden<00:02:39.820> brown<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.690> just
