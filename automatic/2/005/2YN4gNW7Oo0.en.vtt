the reactor gamma titanium this is the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.410 
the reactor gamma titanium this is the
new<00:00:13.440> version<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> gamma<00:00:14.580> watch<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.330> was

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
new version of the gamma watch that was

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.900 
new version of the gamma watch that was
previously<00:00:15.809> released<00:00:16.170> only<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.830> steel<00:00:17.279> this

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
previously released only in steel this

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120 
previously released only in steel this
version<00:00:18.360> is<00:00:18.450> an<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.900> titanium<00:00:19.470> including<00:00:20.040> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
version is an all titanium including the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
version is an all titanium including the
case<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.610> the<00:00:21.149> bracelet<00:00:21.660> there's<00:00:21.899> also<00:00:22.079> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
case and the bracelet there's also a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.810 
case and the bracelet there's also a
version<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.739> rubber<00:00:23.009> bracelet<00:00:23.610> if<00:00:23.730> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
version with a rubber bracelet if you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.030 
version with a rubber bracelet if you
like<00:00:24.059> the<00:00:24.630> gamma<00:00:24.869> watch<00:00:25.200> is<00:00:25.470> probably

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
like the gamma watch is probably

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.510 
like the gamma watch is probably
reactors<00:00:27.439> best-selling<00:00:28.439> timepiece<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.430> it's

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
reactors best-selling timepiece and it's

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.310 
reactors best-selling timepiece and it's
been<00:00:29.640> upgraded<00:00:30.180> a<00:00:30.239> little<00:00:30.419> bit<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.110> first

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
been upgraded a little bit the first

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
been upgraded a little bit the first
thing<00:00:31.559> has<00:00:31.649> got<00:00:31.829> their<00:00:32.160> never<00:00:32.790> dark

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
thing has got their never dark

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.170 
thing has got their never dark
technology<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.440> ND<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.910> on

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
technology you can see ND right there on

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
technology you can see ND right there on
the<00:00:36.390> dial<00:00:36.809> never<00:00:37.469> dark<00:00:37.769> technology<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the dial never dark technology is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.189 
the dial never dark technology is
basically<00:00:39.179> a<00:00:39.210> combination<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.019> traditional

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
basically a combination of traditional

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.689 
basically a combination of traditional
luminance<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.339> well<00:00:42.269> as<00:00:42.480> tritium<00:00:42.929> gas<00:00:43.170> tubes

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
luminance as well as tritium gas tubes

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.299 
luminance as well as tritium gas tubes
and<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.820> idea<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.929> it<00:00:46.469> will<00:00:46.679> never<00:00:47.129> be

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and the idea is that it will never be

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.189 
and the idea is that it will never be
dark<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.179> can<00:00:48.359> see<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> under<00:00:48.960> all

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
dark and you can see it under all

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.959 
dark and you can see it under all
circumstances<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> might<00:00:50.519> be<00:00:50.640> asking

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
circumstances and you might be asking

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.680 
circumstances and you might be asking
yourself<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.989> would<00:00:52.409> you<00:00:52.589> want<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:52.980> have

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
yourself why would you want to have

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
yourself why would you want to have
regular<00:00:54.690> luminance<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:56.129> already<00:00:56.309> have

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
regular luminance if you already have

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.279 
regular luminance if you already have
tritium<00:00:57.089> gas<00:00:57.300> tubes<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> tritium

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
tritium gas tubes because the tritium

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.799 
tritium gas tubes because the tritium
gas<00:00:58.620> tubes<00:00:58.980> will<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.609> luminant<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> time

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
gas tubes will be luminant all the time

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
gas tubes will be luminant all the time
for<00:01:01.170> about<00:01:01.319> 20-25<00:01:01.800> years<00:01:02.129> without<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.059> need

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
for about 20-25 years without the need

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.509 
for about 20-25 years without the need
to<00:01:03.269> be<00:01:03.539> charged<00:01:03.870> by<00:01:03.960> light<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:05.070> regular

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to be charged by light but regular

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
to be charged by light but regular
luminance<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.080> bit

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
luminance is actually a little bit

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
luminance is actually a little bit
brighter<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.100> fully<00:01:08.340> charged<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.480> all

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
brighter when it's fully charged so all

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.610 
brighter when it's fully charged so all
the<00:01:09.990> numerals<00:01:10.700> have<00:01:11.840> regular<00:01:12.840> luminance<00:01:13.410> as

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
the numerals have regular luminance as

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.430 
the numerals have regular luminance as

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
I'm not a fan of all of their designs

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.080 
I'm not a fan of all of their designs
but<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.079> like<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.439> gamma<00:02:14.090> there's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
but I really do like the gamma there's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.220 
but I really do like the gamma there's
sort<00:02:15.329> of<00:02:15.420> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
sort of this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.759 
sort of this
textured<00:02:17.450> titanium<00:02:18.450> here<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.290> bracelet

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
textured titanium here on the bracelet

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.009 
textured titanium here on the bracelet
which<00:02:20.069> actually<00:02:20.549> feels<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.450> nice<00:02:21.659> it's

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
which actually feels kind of nice it's

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.630 
which actually feels kind of nice it's
got<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.379> bit<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> shine<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.190> which

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
got a little bit of a shine to it which

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
got a little bit of a shine to it which
again<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.209> on<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.900> rotating<00:02:25.409> bezel

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
again you can see on the rotating bezel

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.690 
again you can see on the rotating bezel
the<00:02:26.099> rotating<00:02:26.489> bezel<00:02:26.610> moves<00:02:27.299> pretty<00:02:27.900> easily

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the rotating bezel moves pretty easily

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
the rotating bezel moves pretty easily
sometimes<00:02:29.700> people<00:02:29.909> like<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.599> bit

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
sometimes people like a little bit

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170 
sometimes people like a little bit
sturdier<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.739> bezel<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:32.580> when<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.849> shake

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
sturdier of a bezel but when you shake

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.259 
sturdier of a bezel but when you shake
the<00:02:33.360> watch<00:02:33.569> there's<00:02:34.410> no<00:02:34.739> wiggle<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.849> bezel

the watch there's no wiggle to the bezel
which<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.870> pretty<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.769> little

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
which is pretty good so it's a little

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
which is pretty good so it's a little
bit<00:02:38.040> easy<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:38.940> one<00:02:39.150> out<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.480> place

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
bit easy to get this one out of place

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.839 
bit easy to get this one out of place
but<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.799> not<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.760> to
