very well I think about total of twenty
kilsby<00:01:44.640> yeah<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.600> um<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> pretty<00:01:46.500> good

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
kilsby yeah so um I was a pretty good

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.219 
kilsby yeah so um I was a pretty good
game<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.040> got<00:01:47.220> 11<00:01:47.700> kills<00:01:47.909> myself<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.509> he<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:48.960> he

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
game I got 11 kills myself and he got he

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.410 
game I got 11 kills myself and he got he
got<00:01:49.259> quite<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> few<00:01:49.799> himself<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.520> yeah<00:01:50.640> but

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
got quite a few himself too so yeah but

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.700

it's<00:01:52.829> good<00:01:52.950> enough<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.189> turn<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's good enough to turn it to a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's good enough to turn it to a
highlights<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.259> um<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.310> quite
