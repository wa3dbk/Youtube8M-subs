it's<00:00:03.419> mid-june<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.230> let's<00:00:05.160> revisit<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
it's mid-june and let's revisit the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.700 
it's mid-june and let's revisit the
Scots<00:00:06.029> classic<00:00:06.509> 20-inch<00:00:06.870> real<00:00:07.080> mower<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.529> see

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
Scots classic 20-inch real mower and see

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.960 
Scots classic 20-inch real mower and see
if<00:00:07.830> it's<00:00:08.010> everything<00:00:08.250> we<00:00:08.460> hoped<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.790> would<00:00:08.940> be

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
if it's everything we hoped it would be

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.870 
if it's everything we hoped it would be
and<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.360> answer<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> most<00:00:11.219> extent<00:00:11.670> yes

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and the answer is to a most extent yes

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.829 
and the answer is to a most extent yes
it's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.300> pretty<00:00:12.450> nice<00:00:12.660> unit<00:00:14.599> right<00:00:15.599> now<00:00:15.780> we

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it's a pretty nice unit right now we

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
it's a pretty nice unit right now we
don't<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.170> any<00:00:16.350> dandelions<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> lawn

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
don't have any dandelions on the lawn

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.830 
don't have any dandelions on the lawn
and<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> line<00:00:18.570> where<00:00:18.750> I've

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and you can see the line where I've

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.269 
and you can see the line where I've
mowed<00:00:19.050> right<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
mowed right there

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000 
mowed right there
it<00:00:20.400> doesn't<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:20.970> dandelions<00:00:21.630> at<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.470> if

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it doesn't do dandelions at all so if

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
it doesn't do dandelions at all so if
you<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.310> lots<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> dandelions<00:00:24.470> probably<00:00:25.470> not

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you have lots of dandelions probably not

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
you have lots of dandelions probably not
best<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.430> throw<00:00:26.580> away<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:27.000> rotary<00:00:27.330> mower<00:00:27.539> yet

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
best to throw away your rotary mower yet

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
best to throw away your rotary mower yet
but<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.260> had<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.590> lawn<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.519> grass<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but if you had just lawn just grass and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
but if you had just lawn just grass and
you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:31.019> mow<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.320> lawn<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> time<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you can mow your lawn all the time that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.010 
you can mow your lawn all the time that
would<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.180> great<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.600> another<00:00:33.899> thing

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
would be great because another thing

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.889 
would be great because another thing
that<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> found<00:00:34.940> when<00:00:35.940> using<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> unit<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that I found when using this unit is you

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
that I found when using this unit is you
got<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> keep<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> keep<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
got to keep up on it you got to keep the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
got to keep up on it you got to keep the
lawn<00:00:38.670> mowed<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.809> longer<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.620> grass

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
lawn mowed because the longer your grass

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
lawn mowed because the longer your grass
gets<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> harder<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.059> push<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.989> been

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
gets the harder it is to push it's been

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
gets the harder it is to push it's been
a<00:00:43.200> real<00:00:43.410> nice<00:00:43.649> unit<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.250> far<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> generally

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
a real nice unit so far what I generally

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
a real nice unit so far what I generally
do<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.620> after<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> mow<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.610> we've

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
do to the you know after I mow and we've

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
do to the you know after I mow and we've
got<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.000> twenty<00:00:48.629> thousand<00:00:49.020> square<00:00:49.110> feet

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
got about twenty thousand square feet

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
got about twenty thousand square feet
here<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> paper

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
here is I just go over with a paper

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
here is I just go over with a paper
towel<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.629> some<00:00:51.989> wd-40<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.980> wipe<00:00:53.100> down

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
towel and some wd-40 and just wipe down

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.529 
towel and some wd-40 and just wipe down
the<00:00:53.340> blades<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> make<00:00:53.879> sure<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.329> nice<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the blades to make sure they're nice and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
the blades to make sure they're nice and
clean<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:55.890> noticing<00:00:56.039> I've

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
clean and what I'm noticing I've

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
clean and what I'm noticing I've
probably<00:00:56.789> been<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:58.199> two

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
probably been using this for about two

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
probably been using this for about two
months<00:00:58.829> now<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.980> guess<00:00:59.370> mowing<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.120> twice<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
months now I guess mowing about twice a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.080 
months now I guess mowing about twice a
week<00:01:00.770> I'm<00:01:01.770> starting<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.850> dull

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
week I'm starting to get a little dull

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.870 
week I'm starting to get a little dull
around<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> ends<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.700> I'm<00:01:05.700> not

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
around the ends here because I'm not

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.530 
around the ends here because I'm not
sure<00:01:06.060> why<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.659> flipping<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> unit<00:01:07.409> over

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
sure why but by flipping the unit over

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.679 
sure why but by flipping the unit over
you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.840> access<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.450> cutting<00:01:12.450> edge

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you can get access to the cutting edge

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.300 
you can get access to the cutting edge
here<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.799> shearing<00:01:14.189> action

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
here it's actually the shearing action

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.999 
here it's actually the shearing action
between<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> blade<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.140> split<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
between the blade and the split or I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.210 
between the blade and the split or I
should<00:01:17.159> say<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> reel<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.939> blade<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.220> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
should say the reel and the blade and so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
should say the reel and the blade and so
I<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.759> sure<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> nice<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> clean

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
I also make sure this is nice and clean

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
I also make sure this is nice and clean
but<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> seems<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.369> clip<00:01:23.610> paper

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
but it seems like I I can clip paper

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.210 
but it seems like I I can clip paper
real<00:01:24.570> nice<00:01:24.810> within<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> center<00:01:25.710> area<00:01:25.890> here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
real nice within the center area here

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.179 
real nice within the center area here
but<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.939> edges<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:28.710> takes<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
but on my little edges here it takes a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
but on my little edges here it takes a
thicker<00:01:29.490> sheet<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.909> paper<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.180> guess<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
thicker sheet of paper I guess for it to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.210 
thicker sheet of paper I guess for it to
cut<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.259> gonna<00:01:31.350> still<00:01:31.619> keep<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.950> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
cut but we're gonna still keep going on

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.710 
cut but we're gonna still keep going on
that<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.610> might<00:01:32.790> end<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> sharpening<00:01:33.540> this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that so we might end up sharpening this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.230 
that so we might end up sharpening this
thing<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> end<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> season<00:01:35.670> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
thing by the end of the season but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.999 
thing by the end of the season but
upkeep<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.900> its<00:01:37.049> real<00:01:37.259> nice<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.799> say<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
upkeep for its real nice like I say I

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.640 
upkeep for its real nice like I say I
just<00:01:38.310> wipe<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.350> wd-40<00:01:40.350> soaked

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
just wipe it down with a wd-40 soaked

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.319 
just wipe it down with a wd-40 soaked
rag<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.189> keeps<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> nice<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.729> clean<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
rag and that keeps it nice and clean and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.960 
rag and that keeps it nice and clean and
lubricated<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> keep<00:01:44.790> an

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
lubricated and you just got to keep an

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.460 
lubricated and you just got to keep an
eye<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.540> tall<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.960> grass<00:01:46.140> gets

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
eye on with how tall your grass gets

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
eye on with how tall your grass gets
because<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:47.100> grass<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.549> probably<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
because my grass is probably about a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.899 
because my grass is probably about a
half<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:48.750> inch<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.259> higher<00:01:49.729> than<00:01:50.729> what

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
half an inch right now higher than what

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.280 
half an inch right now higher than what
I'm<00:01:51.030> cutting<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> cut<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.140> two

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
I'm cutting at and I cut at about two

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.200 
I'm cutting at and I cut at about two
and<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> quarter<00:01:52.619> inches<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.090> some

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and a quarter inches and there are some

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.399 
and a quarter inches and there are some
spots<00:01:54.450> where<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.110> thicker

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
spots where it's a little bit thicker

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
spots where it's a little bit thicker
and<00:01:55.680> boy<00:01:55.829> she's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.490> harder<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and boy she's a little bit harder to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.109 
and boy she's a little bit harder to
push<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.450> sure<00:01:58.820> another<00:01:59.820> thing<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
push that's for sure another thing I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
push that's for sure another thing I
noticed<00:02:00.149> about<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.780> mower<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.380> handle

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
noticed about the mower is this handle

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940 
noticed about the mower is this handle
mechanism<00:02:02.390> now<00:02:03.390> lots<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.840> bolts<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.619> bolts

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
mechanism now lots of bolts here bolts

here bolts here makes it kind of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.630 
here bolts here makes it kind of
flexible<00:02:06.509> almost<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> bad<00:02:07.649> extent<00:02:08.069> when

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
flexible almost to a bad extent when

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.889 
flexible almost to a bad extent when
you're<00:02:08.759> doing<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.300> trim<00:02:09.509> mowing<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you're doing a lot of trim mowing of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.210 
you're doing a lot of trim mowing of
course<00:02:10.110> you're<00:02:10.259> you're<00:02:10.649> pushing<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.039> back<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
course you're you're pushing it back and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.979 
course you're you're pushing it back and
forth<00:02:11.580> quite<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.180> these<00:02:12.599> will<00:02:12.780> seem<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
forth quite a bit and these will seem a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.730 
forth quite a bit and these will seem a
little<00:02:13.170> fluffy

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
little fluffy

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
little fluffy
they<00:02:13.920> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.220> push<00:02:14.370> around<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.820> stuff<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
they kind of push around and stuff so I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
they kind of push around and stuff so I
might<00:02:15.990> eventually<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:16.620> next<00:02:16.830> year<00:02:17.060> weld

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
might eventually say next year weld

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.720 
might eventually say next year weld
those<00:02:18.210> up<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.720> make<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:19.050> solid<00:02:19.200> handle

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
those up and make it a solid handle

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.160 
those up and make it a solid handle
although<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.940> might<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.240> used<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.660> help<00:02:21.780> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
although it might be used to help you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.270 
although it might be used to help you
know<00:02:22.260> prevent<00:02:22.590> wear<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.920> tear<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
know prevent wear and tear on the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.690 
know prevent wear and tear on the
machine<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:26.130> might<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.310> something<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
machine but that might be something to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.440 
machine but that might be something to
look<00:02:26.730> into<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.330> few<00:02:28.790> more<00:02:29.790> notes<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.150> wanted<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
look into a few more notes I wanted to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840 
look into a few more notes I wanted to
put<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:30.840> video<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.530> reel<00:02:31.710> mower<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
put in this video about the reel mower I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.730 
put in this video about the reel mower I
mentioned<00:02:33.360> about<00:02:33.510> how<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.380> test<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> see

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
mentioned about how you can test to see

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.290 
mentioned about how you can test to see
how<00:02:35.010> well<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> blade<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.700> cutting<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> do

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
how well the blade is cutting and you do

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.780 
how well the blade is cutting and you do
that<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.630> piece<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.020> paper<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.790> between

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
that with a piece of paper and between

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.570 
that with a piece of paper and between
the<00:02:38.970> real<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.450> blade<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.590> theory<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.460> I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the real and the blade it in theory if I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.220 
the real and the blade it in theory if I
can<00:02:41.730> hold<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.120> piece<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.720> paper<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.140> turn

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
can hold this piece of paper and turn

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.450 
can hold this piece of paper and turn
the<00:02:43.380> reel<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> same<00:02:43.830> time<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.220> hold<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
the reel at the same time and hold the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.050 
the reel at the same time and hold the
camera'<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:46.020> should<00:02:46.260> clip<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:46.710> off<00:02:47.060> just

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
camera' it should clip it right off just

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000 
camera' it should clip it right off just
like<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.540> pair<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.230> scissors<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.710> now<00:02:49.830> see

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
like a pair of scissors would now see

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.350 
like a pair of scissors would now see
you<00:02:50.070> didn't<00:02:50.340> back<00:02:50.430> cut<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.790> very<00:02:50.970> well<00:02:51.120> but

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you didn't back cut that very well but

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
you didn't back cut that very well but
as<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.540> move<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.920> heat<00:02:52.920> snips<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.550> like

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
as I move in heat snips it just like

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
as I move in heat snips it just like
scissors<00:02:56.570> we<00:02:57.570> were<00:02:57.690> getting<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> little<00:02:58.110> bit<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
scissors we were getting a little bit of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.340 
scissors we were getting a little bit of
that<00:02:58.440> if<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.010> guy's<00:02:59.220> head<00:02:59.430> right<00:02:59.610> off<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> on

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
that if that guy's head right off so on

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.480 
that if that guy's head right off so on
the<00:03:01.440> center<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.710> my<00:03:01.830> blade<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.190> cuts<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
the center of my blade it cuts just

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.330 
the center of my blade it cuts just
right<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:04.260> as<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:04.590> farther<00:03:04.770> towards<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
right but as I get farther towards the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.440 
right but as I get farther towards the
edges<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:10.580> little<00:03:11.580> bit<00:03:11.850> dull<00:03:12.030> towards<00:03:12.360> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
edges a little bit dull towards the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.060 
edges a little bit dull towards the
edges<00:03:12.570> there<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.320> don't<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.830> if<00:03:13.920> this

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
edges there so I don't know if this

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.950 
edges there so I don't know if this
machine<00:03:14.220> came<00:03:14.550> that<00:03:14.760> way<00:03:14.880> or<00:03:15.150> whether<00:03:15.810> I'm

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
machine came that way or whether I'm

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.810 
machine came that way or whether I'm
wearing<00:03:16.110> her<00:03:16.320> out<00:03:16.380> or<00:03:16.740> what<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:17.400> I'm

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
wearing her out or what have you but I'm

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.850 
wearing her out or what have you but I'm
sure<00:03:18.150> as<00:03:18.330> we<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:19.020> still<00:03:19.230> cutting<00:03:19.410> real<00:03:19.620> fine

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
sure as we it's still cutting real fine

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.880 
sure as we it's still cutting real fine
so<00:03:20.130> we're<00:03:20.400> gonna<00:03:21.170> just<00:03:22.170> keep<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:22.770> for

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
so we're gonna just keep it as it is for

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.410 
so we're gonna just keep it as it is for
now<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.940> mowing<00:03:24.360> -<00:03:24.600> hip<00:03:24.810> tip<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.530> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
now and a mowing - hip tip for you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.060 
now and a mowing - hip tip for you
because<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.720> do<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.080> overlap<00:03:28.650> your<00:03:28.680> rows

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
because you do have to overlap your rows

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.940 
because you do have to overlap your rows
and<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.760> say<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.120> because<00:03:30.740> like<00:03:31.740> with<00:03:31.890> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
and I say that because like with a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.890 
and I say that because like with a
regular<00:03:32.370> mower<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.240> pretty<00:03:36.390> much<00:03:36.480> follow

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
regular mower you can pretty much follow

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.560 
regular mower you can pretty much follow
in<00:03:37.170> your<00:03:37.200> own<00:03:37.470> wheel<00:03:37.680> tracks<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:38.570> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
in your own wheel tracks because the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.980 
in your own wheel tracks because the
blade<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.470> mower<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:41.550> actually<00:03:42.450> round<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
blade of the mower is actually round and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.630 
blade of the mower is actually round and
will<00:03:43.110> come<00:03:43.290> out<00:03:43.410> beyond<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> wheel<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
will come out beyond the wheel so you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.830 
will come out beyond the wheel so you
can<00:03:44.760> actually<00:03:45.120> kind<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.330> just<00:03:45.420> keep<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.750> your

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
can actually kind of just keep in your

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.300 
can actually kind of just keep in your
wheels<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.230> always<00:03:46.320> get<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.560> mode<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.280> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
wheels and you always get a mode with a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
wheels and you always get a mode with a
real<00:03:47.520> more<00:03:47.730> where<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.910> can't<00:03:48.180> because<00:03:48.600> if

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
real more where you can't because if

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
real more where you can't because if
you'll<00:03:48.960> notice<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:50.340> wheel<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.820> up

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you'll notice here the wheel is up

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640 
you'll notice here the wheel is up
almost<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.750> know<00:03:51.840> two<00:03:51.900> inches<00:03:52.170> away<00:03:52.380> from

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
almost you know two inches away from

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.080 
almost you know two inches away from
where<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> cutting<00:03:53.190> edge<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.760> have<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
where the cutting edge is so you have to

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.780 
where the cutting edge is so you have to
overlap<00:03:54.660> your<00:03:54.690> rows<00:03:55.280> from<00:03:56.280> where<00:03:56.430> your<00:03:56.580> wheel

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
overlap your rows from where your wheel

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.030 
overlap your rows from where your wheel
tracks<00:03:57.120> are<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:58.170> very<00:03:58.380> convenient<00:03:58.920> way<00:03:59.010> I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
tracks are and a very convenient way I

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.500 
tracks are and a very convenient way I
found<00:03:59.370> let<00:03:59.610> me<00:03:59.670> turn<00:03:59.850> around<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.360> mower

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
found let me turn around on the mower

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.570 
found let me turn around on the mower
here<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.380> sticker<00:04:01.710> on<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.070> front<00:04:02.100> here<00:04:02.400> -

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
believe it or not if I put the wheel

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.800 
believe it or not if I put the wheel
tracks<00:04:04.710> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.160> row<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.460> have<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.910> cut<00:04:06.150> right

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
tracks of the row I have in cut right

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.930

here around the Scott's name that leaves

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.180 
here around the Scott's name that leaves
me<00:04:09.120> this<00:04:09.270> much<00:04:09.510> extra<00:04:09.830> that'll<00:04:10.830> actually<00:04:11.130> you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
me this much extra that'll actually you

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.390 
me this much extra that'll actually you
know<00:04:11.310> essentially<00:04:11.700> be<00:04:11.970> there<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:13.400> equip

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
know essentially be there to equip

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.710 
know essentially be there to equip
whatever<00:04:14.730> I've<00:04:14.910> missed<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
whatever I've missed and then on the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.690 
whatever I've missed and then on the
other<00:04:15.750> side<00:04:15.930> anywhere<00:04:16.920> in<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.130> green<00:04:17.400> area

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
other side anywhere in this green area

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.490 
other side anywhere in this green area
here<00:04:17.910> once<00:04:18.090> again<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.390> about<00:04:18.630> three<00:04:19.170> or<00:04:19.320> four

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
here once again it's about three or four

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.050 
here once again it's about three or four
inches<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:19.980> each<00:04:20.130> side<00:04:20.160> there<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:20.609> just<00:04:20.850> use

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
inches on each side there so just use

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.270 
inches on each side there so just use
the<00:04:21.150> sticker<00:04:21.359> as<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> guide<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:23.100> works

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
the sticker as a guide and it works

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440 
the sticker as a guide and it works
pretty<00:04:23.460> good<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.910> make<00:04:24.090> sure<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.300> overlap

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
pretty good so you make sure you overlap

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.790 
pretty good so you make sure you overlap
your<00:04:24.930> rows<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.110> little<00:04:25.440> bit<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.770> don't

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
your rows a little bit so you don't

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.379 
your rows a little bit so you don't
leave<00:04:26.010> any<00:04:26.190> strips<00:04:26.550> of

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
leave any strips of

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.580 
leave any strips of
grass<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:29.210> know<00:04:30.210> in<00:04:30.389> my<00:04:30.479> prior<00:04:30.780> video<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.199> kind<00:04:31.530> of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
grass I know in my prior video I kind of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.899 
grass I know in my prior video I kind of
showed<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.919> demonstrating<00:04:32.490> cutting<00:04:32.759> grass

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
showed you demonstrating cutting grass

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:34.249 
showed you demonstrating cutting grass
I'm<00:04:33.120> going<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.300> try<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.509> do<00:04:33.659> it<00:04:33.780> now<00:04:33.960> even

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
I'm going to try to do it now even

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.439 
I'm going to try to do it now even
though<00:04:35.009> it<00:04:35.129> is<00:04:35.219> kind<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.490> thick<00:04:35.699> it's<00:04:36.150> really

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
though it is kind of thick it's really

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.879 
though it is kind of thick it's really
neat<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.629> watch<00:04:36.840> mow<00:04:37.169> but<00:04:37.409> I<00:04:37.439> just<00:04:37.620> don't<00:04:37.710> want

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
neat to watch mow but I just don't want

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.050 
neat to watch mow but I just don't want
to<00:04:37.919> give<00:04:38.069> you<00:04:38.159> that<00:04:38.279> standard<00:04:38.759> generic

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
to give you that standard generic

00:04:39.060 --> 00:05:06.110 
to give you that standard generic
watching<00:04:39.479> me<00:04:39.539> push<00:04:39.749> my<00:04:39.930> room<00:04:40.169> over<00:04:40.349> type<00:04:40.620> video
