00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
on earth is to make sure it is not worth

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.050 
on earth is to make sure it is not worth
coming<00:02:10.270> here<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:11.230> mine<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.920> drill<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.670> the

coming here to mine and drill and the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.690 
coming here to mine and drill and the
only<00:02:13.360> way<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.230> achieve<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.489> be
