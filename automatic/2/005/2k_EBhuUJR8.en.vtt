00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.980
 complex lock itself to us 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.219
 you need to get the lock 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 turn back a bit further 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.020
 click here these buttons and get up yourself 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 lock padlock looks like this folded 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 position as you know this lock is not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 snack they nippers 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 no bolt cut me what it means he made 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.079
 from metal coating he has some 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.090
 polymer is quite soft that is it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.039
 very good that will allow us not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 scratch our frame when we are 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.740
 to fasten our bike included 2 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 the key here is such a hole for 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.060
 keyhole hidden 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.229
 Here is such a catch that principle, too 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.240
 very well protects from moisture 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.430
 insert the product key turns and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.670
 here is our castle 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.780
 to open it means the castle of course has a number 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.870
 of its features even obzkazal minuses 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.640
 look like the diameter of the castle I honestly 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.830
 I forgot its size in the signature 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 we will say the exact dimensions of this 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.170
 rings, that is, we can use this lock 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.330
 buckle up not every post 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.400
 we can fasten the bike maximum 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.400
 some railing still led to this 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.920
 tree that is worth pine bike and 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.540
 feather pine about that this lock 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 comprehend and to this pine talk even 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.580
 it may not be but the only option 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.830
 who need such locks in length and possible 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.530
 buy two such locks and just between them 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.940
 This design will allow 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.770
 do but the option is quite expensive 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.750
 because the lock here this cost me 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.709
 59 dollars then two locks it will be 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.510
 about 120 dollars as far as it is 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.370
 madly I don't know what's the best 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.220
 option to fasten the bike 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.050
 this lock well, I understand it so much easier 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.910
 just pull off the rear wheel and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.620
 frame do not search for any 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.130
 suitable translated pillars of the desired 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.280
 diameter 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.580
 but 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 this option of stitching of course myself 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.600
 justify here in conjunction with the bike 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.230
 alarm that is when we bike 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.700
 how will we reach behind this frame and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 clover rear wheels 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.660
 want it yourself in that position not 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.770
 it will turn out that it will be necessary 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.750
 intruder carry 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.610
 but when he will carry the bike will 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.770
 stagger and work anyway and 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.010
 signaling under the video will be a reference to 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.690
 the store where you bought this lock and will 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.160
 link to video by floor in general will be 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.020
 back of the castle 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.020
 Thank you all for your attention
