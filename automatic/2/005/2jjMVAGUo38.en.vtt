binder keep in mind that when conditions

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.779 
binder keep in mind that when conditions
are<00:00:10.809> abrasive<00:00:11.139> you'll<00:00:11.500> eat<00:00:11.620> more<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.129> when

are abrasive you'll eat more and when

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.039 
are abrasive you'll eat more and when
conditions<00:00:13.030> aren't<00:00:13.330> so<00:00:13.480> bracelet<00:00:13.840> you'll<00:00:13.930> eat

that<00:00:16.270> but<00:00:16.600> let<00:00:17.110> me<00:00:17.199> show<00:00:17.320> how<00:00:17.410> to<00:00:17.470> put<00:00:17.619> it<00:00:17.710> on<00:00:17.740> in

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
that but let me show how to put it on in

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.779 
that but let me show how to put it on in
general<00:00:18.990> before<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.350> apply<00:00:20.650> binder<00:00:21.279> you're

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
general before you apply binder you're

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.939 
general before you apply binder you're
gonna<00:00:21.910> want<00:00:22.179> to<00:00:22.210> sand<00:00:22.509> your<00:00:22.599> base<00:00:22.869> your<00:00:23.710> kick

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
gonna want to sand your base your kick

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.970 
gonna want to sand your base your kick
zone<00:00:24.160> I<00:00:24.429> like<00:00:25.419> I<00:00:25.660> like<00:00:25.929> this<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:26.259> one<00:00:26.529> ie<00:00:26.650> grit

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
zone I like I like this is one ie grit

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.550 
zone I like I like this is one ie grit
sandpaper<00:00:27.419> 180<00:00:28.419> grit<00:00:28.539> sandpaper<00:00:28.779> is<00:00:29.080> good<00:00:29.259> for

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
sandpaper 180 grit sandpaper is good for

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.690 
sandpaper 180 grit sandpaper is good for
most<00:00:30.630> kick<00:00:31.630> wax<00:00:31.749> conditions<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.560> like<00:00:33.340> using<00:00:33.520> a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
most kick wax conditions I like using a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.000 
most kick wax conditions I like using a
block<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.270> keeps<00:00:34.930> your<00:00:35.050> base<00:00:35.230> flat<00:00:35.500> if<00:00:35.829> you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
block that keeps your base flat if you

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.470 
block that keeps your base flat if you
don't<00:00:36.190> use<00:00:36.310> a<00:00:36.340> block<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.850> just<00:00:36.879> use<00:00:37.120> your<00:00:37.239> hand

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
don't use a block and just use your hand

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.990 
don't use a block and just use your hand
you<00:00:37.960> can<00:00:38.110> round<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:39.010> base<00:00:39.219> under<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.760> foot

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
you can round the base under the foot

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.209 
you can round the base under the foot
which<00:00:40.629> results<00:00:41.079> in<00:00:41.199> less<00:00:41.410> contact<00:00:41.980> with<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
which results in less contact with the

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.130 
which results in less contact with the
base<00:00:42.399> in<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.699> snow<00:00:42.940> so<00:00:43.449> I<00:00:43.480> recommend<00:00:43.870> using<00:00:43.960> a

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
base in the snow so I recommend using a

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.310 
base in the snow so I recommend using a
block<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:45.430> you<00:00:45.550> can<00:00:45.760> sand<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.210> simply<00:00:47.140> by

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
block and you can sand it simply by

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.900 
block and you can sand it simply by
doing<00:00:47.379> this<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:50.440> people<00:00:50.680> use<00:00:50.910> sideways

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
doing this some people use sideways

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.459 
doing this some people use sideways
motions<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.570> circles<00:00:52.960> it<00:00:53.079> doesn't<00:00:53.320> really

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
motions and circles it doesn't really

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.000 
motions and circles it doesn't really
matter

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
matter

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.259 
matter
main<00:00:54.399> thing<00:00:54.609> is<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.760> rough<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.239> up<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:58.000> next

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
main thing is to rough it up the next

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.000 
main thing is to rough it up the next
step<00:00:58.449> is<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.809> apply<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:59.170> bait<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.649> binder

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
step is to apply the bait the binder

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.279 
step is to apply the bait the binder
apply<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.239> same<00:01:01.269> way<00:01:01.629> you'd<00:01:01.780> apply<00:01:02.050> kick

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
apply it the same way you'd apply kick

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:14.880 
apply it the same way you'd apply kick
wax<00:01:02.500> just<00:01:03.460> by<00:01:03.640> cradling<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:13.620> and<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.740> can

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
wax just by cradling it on and you can

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.410 
wax just by cradling it on and you can
take<00:01:15.010> your<00:01:15.160> iron<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:17.610> heat<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:22.180> doing

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
take your iron and heat it you're doing

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.540 
take your iron and heat it you're doing
this<00:01:22.510> to<00:01:22.690> get<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> fix<00:01:23.890> itself<00:01:24.220> very<00:01:24.490> well

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
this to get it to a fix itself very well

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.160 
this to get it to a fix itself very well
to<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.850> base<00:01:25.060> as<00:01:25.270> well<00:01:25.420> as<00:01:25.480> it's<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.810> nice<00:01:25.990> way

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
to the base as well as it's a nice way

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.510 
to the base as well as it's a nice way
to<00:01:26.230> smooth<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.620> out<00:01:31.800> when<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.890> wax<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.280> still

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
to smooth it out when the wax is still

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.560 
to smooth it out when the wax is still
warm<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.300> can<00:01:34.330> take<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.630> cork<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:36.570> distribute

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
warm you can take a cork and distribute

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.910 
warm you can take a cork and distribute
it<00:01:37.690> better<00:01:37.930> over<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.350> base<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.560> would<00:01:44.740> be<00:01:44.890> a

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
it better over the base this would be a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.610 
it better over the base this would be a
binder<00:01:45.460> application<00:01:46.090> for<00:01:46.870> not<00:01:47.050> very<00:01:47.320> abrasive

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
binder application for not very abrasive

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.070 
binder application for not very abrasive
snow<00:01:48.150> where<00:01:49.150> you<00:01:49.270> don't<00:01:49.420> need<00:01:49.540> a<00:01:49.600> real<00:01:49.810> thick

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
snow where you don't need a real thick

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.830 
snow where you don't need a real thick
application<00:01:51.120> I'm<00:01:52.120> gonna<00:01:52.300> put<00:01:52.480> a<00:01:52.510> little<00:01:52.630> more

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
application I'm gonna put a little more

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.580 
application I'm gonna put a little more
on<00:01:52.960> now<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.860> show<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:55.050> what<00:01:56.050> an<00:01:56.140> application

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
on now and show you what an application

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.000 
on now and show you what an application
looks<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:56.920> from<00:01:57.130> more<00:01:57.670> abrasive<00:01:58.000> snow<00:01:59.010> so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
looks like from more abrasive snow so

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.470 
looks like from more abrasive snow so
this<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.250> on<00:02:00.370> top<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.940> application<00:02:01.420> that

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
this is on top of the application that

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.680 
this is on top of the application that
already<00:02:01.690> did<00:02:02.940> which<00:02:03.940> was<00:02:04.150> for<00:02:04.360> non<00:02:04.480> abrasive

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
already did which was for non abrasive

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.020 
already did which was for non abrasive
snow<00:02:05.140> as<00:02:06.010> you<00:02:06.040> can<00:02:06.190> see<00:02:06.310> about<00:02:06.490> how<00:02:06.640> much<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.880> put

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
snow as you can see about how much I put

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.059 
snow as you can see about how much I put
on<00:02:09.300> heat<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.650> smooth<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.040> out

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
on heat that up so you can smooth it out

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.440 
on heat that up so you can smooth it out
well<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.459> take<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.670> air<00:02:12.819> out<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:13.120> it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.010 

take<00:02:18.450> your<00:02:18.570> cork<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:20.510> lightly<00:02:21.510> smooth<00:02:21.870> that

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
take your cork and lightly smooth that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.550 
take your cork and lightly smooth that
out<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.210> got<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.540> twice<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.020> much<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.350> but

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
out and I got about twice as much on but

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
out and I got about twice as much on but
it's<00:02:25.650> still<00:02:25.800> very<00:02:25.940> or<00:02:26.940> three<00:02:27.120> times<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.480> much

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
it's still very or three times as much

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's still very or three times as much
on<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.080> still<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.260> smooth<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.850> main

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
on but it's still very smooth the main

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
on but it's still very smooth the main
difference<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.510> can't<00:02:30.810> see<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> sand

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
difference is you can't see the sand

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.790 
difference is you can't see the sand
marks<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> structure<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> wax<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
marks in the structure of the wax the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.990 
marks in the structure of the wax the
way<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> could<00:02:35.220> what<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.460> was<00:02:35.550> very<00:02:35.730> fine

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
way I could what it was very fine

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
way I could what it was very fine
there's<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:36.960> on<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.530> hard<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.770> see

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
there's more on there it's hard to see

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560 
there's more on there it's hard to see
cuz<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.220> very<00:02:38.250> smooth<00:02:38.700> but<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> main

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
cuz it's very smooth but that's the main

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.950 
cuz it's very smooth but that's the main
difference

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
difference

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.500 
difference
a<00:02:40.110> very<00:02:40.740> fine<00:02:40.980> application<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.300> tacky

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
a very fine application it's just tacky

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.900 
a very fine application it's just tacky
and<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.709> see<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> sand<00:02:44.730> paper

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and you can you can see the sand paper

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.210 
and you can you can see the sand paper
marks<00:02:45.270> where<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.110> application<00:02:46.770> its<00:02:46.950> tacky

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
marks where this application its tacky

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
marks where this application its tacky
but<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.610> can't<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> marks<00:02:48.390> because

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
but you can't see the marks because

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.890 
but you can't see the marks because
there's<00:02:48.750> about<00:02:48.930> three<00:02:49.260> times<00:02:49.410> as<00:02:49.530> much<00:02:49.650> on
