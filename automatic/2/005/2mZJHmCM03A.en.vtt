we're<00:02:50.280> also<00:02:50.430> going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.030> put<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.140> into<00:02:52.500> a

then<00:03:05.850> we're<00:03:06.180> coming<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.810> filter<00:03:07.320> menu

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
then we're coming up to the filter menu

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.600 
then we're coming up to the filter menu

previously<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:23.160> something<00:03:23.519> much<00:03:23.730> more

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
previously to something much more

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.390 
previously to something much more
aggressive<00:03:25.260> here<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:25.920> going<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> choose

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
aggressive here I'm going to choose

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.240 
aggressive here I'm going to choose
between<00:03:26.820> 50<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.239> 60<00:03:27.630> pixels<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.680> as<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.070> can

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
between 50 and 60 pixels and as you can

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.270 
between 50 and 60 pixels and as you can
see<00:03:29.280> now<00:03:29.670> we're<00:03:29.910> actually<00:03:30.000> getting<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.720> term

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
see now we're actually getting that term

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.430 
see now we're actually getting that term
HDR<00:03:32.280> look<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:32.820> were<00:03:32.880> achieving<00:03:33.480> slightly

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
HDR look that we were achieving slightly

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.140 
HDR look that we were achieving slightly
different<00:03:34.799> approach<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.790> slightly

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
different approach and a slightly

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
different approach and a slightly
different<00:03:36.480> outcome<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:38.130> has<00:03:38.310> actually<00:03:38.459> got

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
different outcome this has actually got

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.000 
different outcome this has actually got
a<00:03:38.880> little<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:39.299> more<00:03:39.510> control<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.989> find<00:03:40.440> them

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
a little bit more control I find them

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.970 
a little bit more control I find them
because<00:03:41.400> we've<00:03:41.820> been<00:03:42.180> left<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
because we've been left with a

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.710 
because we've been left with a
multi-layered<00:03:43.980> file<00:03:44.400> where<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.360> adjust

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
multi-layered file where we can adjust

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.229 
multi-layered file where we can adjust
the<00:03:45.840> past<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> also<00:03:47.070> increase<00:03:47.820> settings

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
the past is and also increase settings

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.830 
the past is and also increase settings
by<00:03:48.480> switching<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:49.049> overlay<00:03:49.820> etc<00:03:50.820> etc<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:51.720> can

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
by switching to overlay etc etc we can

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
by switching to overlay etc etc we can
also<00:03:51.959> start<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.680> technique<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
also start this technique on a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.250 
also start this technique on a
multi-layered<00:03:53.910> file<00:03:54.180> we<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:55.079> to

multi-layered file we don't have to

apply this particular technique now if

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.560

again<00:04:09.209> and<00:04:09.420> then<00:04:10.019> come<00:04:10.290> down<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.799> filter<00:04:11.510> blur

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
again and then come down to filter blur

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.500 
again and then come down to filter blur
and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.680> choose<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.010> Gaussian<00:04:14.790> blur<00:04:14.940> filter

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
and then choose the Gaussian blur filter

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.080 
and then choose the Gaussian blur filter
and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.709> choose<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.070> small<00:04:17.669> amount<00:04:17.970> of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and then just choose a small amount of

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.330 
and then just choose a small amount of
Gaussian<00:04:18.539> blur<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:19.229> not<00:04:19.530> probably<00:04:19.950> not<00:04:20.039> so

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
Gaussian blur but not probably not so

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.979 
Gaussian blur but not probably not so
small<00:04:20.700> as<00:04:20.880> one

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
small as one

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.300 
small as one
otherwise<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.500> going<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> be<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:22.949> a<00:04:23.280> little

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
otherwise is going to be just a little

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.700 
otherwise is going to be just a little
bit<00:04:23.669> too<00:04:23.970> subtle<00:04:24.419> for<00:04:24.449> us<00:04:24.780> I'm<00:04:25.319> just<00:04:25.440> going<00:04:25.620> to

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
bit too subtle for us I'm just going to

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.589 
bit too subtle for us I'm just going to
drag<00:04:25.919> this<00:04:25.979> out<00:04:26.340> perhaps<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.910> slightly

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
drag this out perhaps to a slightly

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.260 
drag this out perhaps to a slightly
higher<00:04:27.720> four<00:04:28.319> or<00:04:28.860> five<00:04:29.190> pixels<00:04:29.759> to<00:04:30.090> get<00:04:30.240> a

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
higher four or five pixels to get a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.719 
higher four or five pixels to get a
little<00:04:30.539> bit<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.870> softening<00:04:31.349> of<00:04:31.500> Turin<00:04:31.860> okay

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
little bit of softening of Turin okay

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.839 
little bit of softening of Turin okay
and<00:04:32.970> then<00:04:33.090> select<00:04:33.479> ok<00:04:33.979> now<00:04:34.979> if<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.400> click<00:04:35.639> on

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
and then select ok now if we click on

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.159 
and then select ok now if we click on
and<00:04:36.000> off<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.270> visibility<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
and off the visibility of that

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.779 
and off the visibility of that
background<00:04:37.440> copy<00:04:37.949> layer<00:04:38.099> which<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.460> now<00:04:38.759> the

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
background copy layer which is now the

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.089 
background copy layer which is now the
Gaussian<00:04:39.539> blur<00:04:39.690> there<00:04:39.990> you'll<00:04:40.590> see<00:04:40.889> that

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
Gaussian blur there you'll see that

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.860 
Gaussian blur there you'll see that
we're<00:04:41.520> just<00:04:41.729> suffering<00:04:42.210> up<00:04:42.449> some<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.780> those

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
we're just suffering up some of those

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290 
we're just suffering up some of those
underlying<00:04:43.229> tones<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:44.520> leaving<00:04:45.270> that

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
underlying tones but leaving that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.670 
underlying tones but leaving that
expanded<00:04:46.050> mid-tone<00:04:46.500> contrast<00:04:48.050> okay<00:04:49.050> now<00:04:49.530> if

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
expanded mid-tone contrast okay now if

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.490 
expanded mid-tone contrast okay now if
that<00:04:49.830> seems<00:04:50.039> quite<00:04:50.340> an<00:04:50.550> involved<00:04:50.849> routine<00:04:51.750> I'm

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
that seems quite an involved routine I'm

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.110 
that seems quite an involved routine I'm
just<00:04:52.710> going<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.889> select<00:04:53.099> all<00:04:53.370> three<00:04:53.729> of<00:04:53.849> these

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
just going to select all three of these

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.279 
just going to select all three of these
layers<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.720> then<00:04:55.319> delete<00:04:55.800> them<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:57.300> yes<00:04:58.080> I

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
layers and then delete them and yes I

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.899 
layers and then delete them and yes I
don't<00:04:58.409> want<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.590> see<00:04:58.740> them<00:04:58.830> again<00:04:58.979> I'm

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
don't want to see them again I'm

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.909 
don't want to see them again I'm
actually<00:05:00.090> created<00:05:00.900> some<00:05:01.139> actions<00:05:01.530> which<00:05:01.740> are

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
actually created some actions which are

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.270 
actually created some actions which are
available<00:05:02.069> from<00:05:02.759> mark<00:05:03.300> gala<00:05:03.659> calm<00:05:04.190> where<00:05:05.190> you

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
available from mark gala calm where you

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.600 
available from mark gala calm where you
can<00:05:05.430> apply<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:06.020> HDR<00:05:07.020> look<00:05:07.409> with<00:05:08.159> a<00:05:08.190> single

can apply this HDR look with a single

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.570 
can apply this HDR look with a single
click<00:05:08.849> of<00:05:09.150> your<00:05:09.240> mouse<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.199> so<00:05:10.889> let's<00:05:11.340> just

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
click of your mouse and so let's just

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820 
click of your mouse and so let's just
collapse<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.389> panel<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.560> drag<00:05:13.770> that

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
collapse this panel and just drag that

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.520 
collapse this panel and just drag that
over<00:05:14.009> there<00:05:14.430> while<00:05:15.120> we<00:05:15.270> look<00:05:15.419> at<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:16.020> actions

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
over there while we look at the actions

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.059 
over there while we look at the actions
panel<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.930> I've<00:05:18.930> called<00:05:19.199> it<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.409> the<00:05:19.650> tonal

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
panel and I've called it the the tonal

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.760 
panel and I've called it the the tonal
mapping<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.169> we've<00:05:22.169> got<00:05:22.319> a<00:05:22.349> number<00:05:22.560> of

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
the single download and we've got

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.379 
the single download and we've got

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
options for if we're working with a

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.450 
options for if we're working with a
single<00:05:30.840> layer<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.620> we've<00:05:31.770> also<00:05:31.949> got<00:05:32.310> options

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
single layer and we've also got options

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.270 
single layer and we've also got options
for<00:05:33.030> when<00:05:33.270> we're<00:05:33.419> working<00:05:33.539> with<00:05:34.380> a<00:05:34.440> file

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
for when we're working with a file

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.279 
for when we're working with a file
that's<00:05:35.310> already<00:05:35.789> had<00:05:36.120> some<00:05:36.389> work<00:05:36.570> done<00:05:36.599> and

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
that's already had some work done and

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.689 
that's already had some work done and
we've<00:05:37.469> got<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.650> couple<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:38.009> adjustment<00:05:38.520> layers

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
we've got a couple of adjustment layers

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.360 
we've got a couple of adjustment layers
or<00:05:38.969> alternative<00:05:39.630> liars<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.110> place<00:05:40.409> and<00:05:40.770> as<00:05:41.250> I

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
or alternative liars in place and as I

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.700 
or alternative liars in place and as I
said<00:05:41.430> this<00:05:42.000> is<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.180> technique<00:05:42.659> that<00:05:42.930> can<00:05:43.500> be

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
said this is a technique that can be

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.830 
said this is a technique that can be
applied<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:44.190> multi<00:05:44.550> layered<00:05:44.820> files<00:05:45.150> I've

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
applied to multi layered files I've

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.420 
applied to multi layered files I've
actually<00:05:45.990> got<00:05:46.259> only<00:05:46.469> got<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.650> single<00:05:46.860> layer<00:05:47.219> in

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
actually got only got a single layer in

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.279 
actually got only got a single layer in
this<00:05:47.820> particular<00:05:48.000> version<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:48.990> I'm<00:05:49.139> just

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
this particular version so I'm just

going to click on one of these options
here<00:05:52.110> we've<00:05:52.680> got<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:53.069> soft<00:05:53.759> technique<00:05:54.419> with

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
here we've got that soft technique with

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.499 
here we've got that soft technique with
the<00:05:55.530> Gaussian<00:05:56.009> blur<00:05:56.130> applied<00:05:56.550> and<00:05:57.180> we've<00:05:57.330> got

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
the Gaussian blur applied and we've got

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.510 
the Gaussian blur applied and we've got
a<00:05:57.539> medium<00:05:58.169> strength<00:05:58.469> without<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:59.069> Gaussian

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
a medium strength without the Gaussian

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.180 
a medium strength without the Gaussian
blur<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.360> high<00:06:00.569> strength<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.349> for<00:06:02.069> those

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
blur and a high strength and for those

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.809 
blur and a high strength and for those
who<00:06:02.250> just<00:06:02.490> love<00:06:03.000> coming<00:06:03.900> in<00:06:04.139> with<00:06:04.620> other<00:06:05.340> with

that HDR look now in all good actions
you<00:06:28.050> will<00:06:28.199> find<00:06:28.560> that<00:06:29.089> we<00:06:30.089> do<00:06:30.210> have<00:06:30.419> the

content and because in some of these

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.710 
content and because in some of these
actions<00:06:43.560> we<00:06:43.710> have<00:06:43.740> quite<00:06:44.460> a<00:06:44.490> lot<00:06:44.700> of<00:06:44.730> steps<00:06:45.090> we

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
actions we have quite a lot of steps we

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.020 
actions we have quite a lot of steps we
also<00:06:45.870> have<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.380> option<00:06:46.530> of<00:06:46.890> doing<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.640> single

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
also have the option of doing a single

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.660 
also have the option of doing a single
undo<00:06:48.510> to<00:06:49.050> get<00:06:49.260> back<00:06:49.500> to<00:06:49.860> where<00:06:50.070> we<00:06:50.130> wanted<00:06:50.610> to

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
undo to get back to where we wanted to

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.870 
undo to get back to where we wanted to
be<00:06:51.210> before<00:06:51.510> we<00:06:51.750> applied<00:06:52.170> so<00:06:52.860> i've<00:06:53.070> included<00:06:53.370> a

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
be before we applied so i've included a

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.420 
be before we applied so i've included a
snapshot<00:06:54.450> in<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:55.170> action<00:06:55.560> and<00:06:55.740> this<00:06:56.160> just

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
snapshot in the action and this just

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.600 
snapshot in the action and this just
allows<00:06:56.490> me<00:06:56.970> to<00:06:57.150> undo<00:06:57.630> with<00:06:58.140> a<00:06:58.170> single<00:06:58.800> click<00:06:59.520> of

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
allows me to undo with a single click of

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.820 
allows me to undo with a single click of
my<00:06:59.910> mouse<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.630> go<00:07:00.810> back<00:07:01.050> to<00:07:01.260> the<00:07:01.350> starting

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
my mouse to go back to the starting

my mouse to go back to the starting
point<00:07:02.070> prior<00:07:02.790> to<00:07:02.820> the<00:07:03.120> action<00:07:03.510> being<00:07:03.750> played

point prior to the action being played
ok<00:07:05.280> as<00:07:05.550> I<00:07:05.790> say<00:07:05.970> these<00:07:06.210> actions<00:07:06.660> are<00:07:06.900> available

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740
