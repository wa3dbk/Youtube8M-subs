little you can't put too much energy

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.660 
little you can't put too much energy
into<00:03:33.050> any<00:03:33.350> one<00:03:33.560> person<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.040> overtake<00:03:34.430> them

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
into any one person and overtake them

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.490 
into any one person and overtake them
but<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.270> think<00:03:35.600> that's<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.870> really<00:03:36.050> nice<00:03:36.170> way<00:03:36.440> to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
but I think that's a really nice way to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.660 
but I think that's a really nice way to
think<00:03:36.680> about<00:03:37.570> life<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.870> actually<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.470> think

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
think about life and actually so I think

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
think about life and actually so I think
