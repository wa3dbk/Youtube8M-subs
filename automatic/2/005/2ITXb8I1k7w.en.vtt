 opportunities in the first period 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 the goal of ayité suffices to the happiness of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.000
 the Corsican team 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 but the Lorient comes back stronger in 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.310
 this second period the players of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 sylvain ripoll must insist the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.120
 president loïc féry worries a little 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.250
 little but these players are doing everything for 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.260
 return quickly equalized in this match 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.840
 side the recessed center for war is and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 what a parade of the case an excellent

 possibility with this change of side 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.160
 the balloon for raphael wariro a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.310

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.680
 so who is injured and who replaced by 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.180
 its vincentini lining it can be a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.399
 problem for the Bastians who suffer 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.039

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.210
 the end of the match and why not score 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.020

 for Corsican but the fault and net 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.250
 it's Sebastian Squilacci and the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.240
 penalty hit by benjamin moukandjo 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.250
