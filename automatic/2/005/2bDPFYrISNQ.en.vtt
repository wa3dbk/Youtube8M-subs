00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.129
 hello everyone but we're going for it 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.110
 new video so this is a video a 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.570
 little bit special since it's for 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.830
 to show you that I changed cameras 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 so I do not know if you're going to 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.710
 see 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.289
 I did some small is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.880
 herman is good I see the difference 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.500
 so why I changed cameras 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.910
 because I thought mine was 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.619
 was a bit old even though the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.050
 quality like is still very very 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 good since it was already hd but 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.710
 I wanted to change my camera 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.980
 and my darling told me why you 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.950
 would not take a pro go so after 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.780
 have seen some videos 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.780
 this is it here I wanted to crack 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.370
 so if you do not know it's a 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.129
 tiny camera so she has about 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.829
 like that she is tiny and she serves 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.170
 mainly normally for 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.680
 athletes since they can be fixed 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.540
 so on the bust or on the head and you 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.770
 embark with you in 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.190
 skiing their extreme sports skiing 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 snowboard surfing is the oea ci fears of 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.220
 things like that so I of course I 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.070
 would not have a sporting uselessness 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.680
 we agree but here I am going 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.210
 serve for my fixed videos and especially 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.960
 if I'm going to use it to do 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.800
 develop on the outside so here we go 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.810
 I really wanted to have a 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.810
 little camera that I can ship 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.640
 by all there summer comes darling 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.050
 soon on vacation we will not move 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 I really wanted to take you 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.630
 do a lot of videos so we go 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.009
 surely go park asterix disneyland 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.229
 then walk right to left and I 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.140
 really want to inaugurate all this and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.340
 to share it with you so I hope 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.440
 you're understanding me I'm super 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.909
 excited I can not wait to make you full 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.429
 outdoor videos 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.649
 so here in the rides I will put 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.840
 the little renée at the level of the chest 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.329
 and you have to get some with me 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 think it's going to be great for 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.929
 to show you a little bit 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.099
 looks like if you want to see so you 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.420
 can always watch on the internet 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.970
 So it's love pro 0.3 la black 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.700
 edition this is the last one and I have them 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.910
 had on cdiscount around 450 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.019
 or 460 I know more exactly 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.489
 finally 450 we'll say that for you the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.560
 show so you do not care about tackling 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.780
 the bottom 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.540
 so here it is a small editing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.450
 rudimentary she is asked here so 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.400
 as you can see in relation to the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.819
 size of my finger she is all 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.489
 small 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.500
 so why this little editing 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.700
 rudimentary because I do not have 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.220
 still small fixation for the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.049
 put directly on my foot with 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.959
 which I usually film 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.700
 usually there are just which are 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.650
 waterproof since it is a camera that will 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.629
 under the water so you put it in and 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.430
 you can film under water so that 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.139
 it's just great I think I 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.060
 will make videos if I go swimming 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.380
 or things like that i'll get you 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.769
 make videos in the water it's going to be 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.790
 Too much fun so here and of course 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.050
 I can not put it in the box 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.400
 since 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.200
 if the medecine in question and I speak 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.730
 we do not hear anymore 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.200
 so here for the moment the little one 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.520
 box is on the foot but I'm going 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.470
 buy me a small adapter for 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.280
 to be able to put it right here 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.620
 what did I want to say yes 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.990
 I'm going to use it for 7 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.340
 july i'm going to japan expo and i'm going 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.160
 use it to take him away 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.170
 finally to take you with me actually 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.850
 and here I am going to buy the little nothing 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.870
 and who goes there and I will take you 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.460
 in the fair aisles 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.490
 I think it's going to be great and 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.790
 especially since there are my girlfriend 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.610
 Sandrine and her husband who finally comes 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.650
 actually joins to pass this 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.600
 day together I am super accurate 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.040
 with too much and of course with 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.110
 sandrine we will make little bits of 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.930
 videos for some for a japanese blog 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.830
 expo so here are some pictures of the videos 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.050

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480
 so I also wanted to show you 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.730
 small purchases just put everything in 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.770

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.210

 so I'm going great I'm not a 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.600
 crazy summer but when I find that 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.489
 I like them I loose them more and there I have 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.970
 found this so we hear a lot 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.580
 talk on TV and that's so you have 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.860
 the tfa his muffin blueberries which 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.180
 looks like that so if from time to time 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.419
 I look to the right because I have 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.450

 darling made me a gift since for 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.610
 continue my collection of 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.860
 of derived objects from the kaamelott series 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.300
 he bought me the first volume of the comic book 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.759
 so the necromancer's army the texts 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.500
 so are by alexander astier and the 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.050
 drawing by steven dupré 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.060
 here are the drawings are super pretty 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.580
 am I'm halfway I have not 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.759
 still provided but here we recognize 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.820
 right now the characters are 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.530

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.479
 really beautiful the colors the drawings 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.550

 I will show you a little more 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.590
 so here we are, we really recognize 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.900
 the texts of alexander astier we have 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.000
 the impression that we read camelot end here 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.440
 it's really that we read it as if 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.190
 we watched the show on TV so 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.110
 it's great so there are seven volumes in 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.900
 the moment finally this comics that came out 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.099

 so you think of this new 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.349
 quality if you prefer it to your ego 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.370
 anyway I think I'm 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.099
 murray all the time and that one there 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.099
 since I really do not find it too 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.389
 wrong and then the facts a little bit missed 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.729
 the facts I can not care 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.930
 Ahizoune seems to me that's it I 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.729
 I think it's nice 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.680
 change and a wide-angle you can 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.449
 to see everything at home is as if you 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.409
 were with me and I find that I find 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.880

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.620

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.570
 just crazy I think it'll be 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.800
 blogs a little delirious it belongs on 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.560
 suspicious but that's what will be great 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.090
