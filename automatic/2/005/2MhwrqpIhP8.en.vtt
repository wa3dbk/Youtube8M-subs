show you how to how it works

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.899 
show you how to how it works
let's<00:00:58.209> make<00:00:59.209> it<00:00:59.239> tonight<00:01:00.129> now<00:01:01.129> when<00:01:01.370> that<00:01:01.519> day

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
let's make it tonight now when that day

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.940 
let's make it tonight now when that day
comes<00:01:02.149> this<00:01:02.870> will<00:01:04.089> harvest<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.170> date

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
comes this will harvest it so this date

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.039 
comes this will harvest it so this date
night<00:01:07.159> sensor<00:01:08.020> will<00:01:09.020> send<00:01:09.289> out<00:01:09.439> a<00:01:09.469> signal<00:01:11.049> to

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
night sensor will send out a signal to

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.550 
night sensor will send out a signal to
to<00:01:12.469> these<00:01:13.600> pistons<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.810> piston<00:01:15.140> distance

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
to these pistons and the piston distance

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.219 
to these pistons and the piston distance
will<00:01:15.770> push<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.189> items<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:18.049> can

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
will push the items here and you can

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.520 
will push the items here and you can
grab<00:01:18.469> them<00:01:18.680> from<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.159> chest<00:01:20.289> it's<00:01:21.289> not

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
grab them from the chest it's not

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.700 
grab them from the chest it's not
foolproof<00:01:22.539> sometimes<00:01:23.539> there<00:01:23.780> are<00:01:23.930> items<00:01:24.469> left

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
foolproof sometimes there are items left

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.789 
foolproof sometimes there are items left
in<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.250> as<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.399> can<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.899> over<00:01:27.320> time<00:01:27.560> it

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
in here as you can see but over time it

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.800 
in here as you can see but over time it
doesn't<00:01:28.189> really<00:01:28.369> matter<00:01:28.820> because<00:01:29.090> they<00:01:29.450> there

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
doesn't really matter because they there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.310 
doesn't really matter because they there
are<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.170> many<00:01:31.149> pumpkins<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.299> manat<00:01:32.600> ministero

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
are so many pumpkins and manat ministero

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.319 
are so many pumpkins and manat ministero
in<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.859> 20<00:01:34.219> minutes<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.700> will<00:01:34.880> harvest<00:01:35.270> and

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
in the 20 minutes this will harvest and

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.319 
in the 20 minutes this will harvest and
so<00:01:38.329> let's<00:01:40.030> see<00:01:41.030> how<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.299> can<00:01:41.570> make<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.329> we

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
so let's see how you can make this we

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.249 
so let's see how you can make this we
start<00:01:44.659> off<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:44.929> this<00:01:45.130> 5.5<00:01:46.130> platform<00:01:47.259> we

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
start off with this 5.5 platform we

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.380 
start off with this 5.5 platform we
stick<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.679> daylight<00:01:49.070> sensor<00:01:49.490> straight<00:01:50.240> in

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
stick the daylight sensor straight in

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.069 
stick the daylight sensor straight in
the<00:01:50.509> middle<00:01:51.429> then<00:01:52.429> we<00:01:52.549> add<00:01:52.789> two<00:01:53.719> sticky

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
the middle then we add two sticky

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.849 
the middle then we add two sticky
pistons<00:01:55.240> replacing<00:01:56.240> these<00:01:56.420> blocks<00:01:56.859> at

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
pistons replacing these blocks at

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.080 
pistons replacing these blocks at
redstone<00:01:58.520> dust<00:01:58.700> here<00:02:00.520> redstone<00:02:01.520> repeaters

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
redstone dust here redstone repeaters

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.520 
redstone dust here redstone repeaters
set<00:02:02.569> to<00:02:02.749> four<00:02:03.049> ticks<00:02:03.289> in<00:02:04.100> here<00:02:05.109> all<00:02:06.109> of<00:02:06.200> these

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
set to four ticks in here all of these

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.259 
set to four ticks in here all of these
four<00:02:06.859> spots<00:02:07.750> had<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:09.050> block<00:02:09.440> there

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
four spots had a block there

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.690 
four spots had a block there
and<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.079> basically<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.519> thick

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and this is basically this is one thick

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.759 
and this is basically this is one thick
pole<00:02:17.939> pole<00:02:18.239> sir<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:19.049> made<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.590> that

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
pole pole sir but I have made it so that

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.160 
pole pole sir but I have made it so that
there's<00:02:19.980> four<00:02:20.189> ticks<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.640> every<00:02:21.060> time<00:02:21.269> this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
there's four ticks and every time this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
there's four ticks and every time this
starts<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.069> give<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.400> signal

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
starts to give out signal

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.089 
starts to give out signal
this<00:02:24.360> will<00:02:24.629> add<00:02:25.310> poles<00:02:27.500> next<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.620> will<00:02:28.739> place

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
this will add poles next we will place

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.449 
this will add poles next we will place
blocks<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:30.090> these<00:02:30.359> four<00:02:30.689> corners<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:32.400> we

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
blocks on these four corners and now we

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.979 
blocks on these four corners and now we
can<00:02:32.640> make<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.680> touched<00:02:34.680> our<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.579> first<00:02:36.480> place

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
can make the touched our so first place

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.649 
can make the touched our so first place
touch<00:02:37.769> their<00:02:38.450> lock<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.629> top<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.019> touch<00:02:40.709> here

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
touch their lock on top of it touch here

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.690 
touch their lock on top of it touch here
block<00:02:42.659> on<00:02:42.840> top<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.409> touch<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:45.590> and

block on top of that touch here and
continue<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.000> pattern<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:50.040> torch<00:02:50.340> is

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
continue with the pattern this torch is

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.920 
continue with the pattern this torch is
the<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.150> controls<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:54.329> piston<00:02:54.690> so

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
the one that controls the the piston so

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.979 
the one that controls the the piston so
we<00:02:55.079> can<00:02:55.200> add<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.920> piston<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:56.659> and<00:02:57.659> then<00:02:57.840> we

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
we can add the piston there and then we

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.830 
we can add the piston there and then we
need<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.409> do<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.519> other<00:02:59.909> four<00:03:00.209> corners<00:03:00.599> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
need to do the other four corners and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.929 
need to do the other four corners and
you<00:03:01.409> can<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.040> need<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.340> alternate<00:03:02.760> this

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
you can you need to alternate this

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.050 
you can you need to alternate this
pattern<00:03:03.329> so<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.709> tower<00:03:04.950> will<00:03:05.370> go<00:03:05.579> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
pattern so this this tower will go in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.429 
pattern so this this tower will go in
this<00:03:06.420> pattern<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.970> will<00:03:09.269> go<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
this pattern this one will go in the

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.420 
this pattern this one will go in the
same<00:03:10.680> fashion

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
same fashion

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:20.589 
same fashion
so<00:03:11.879> in<00:03:12.510> here<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:15.959> on

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.000 

okay<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.199> piston<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.859> be<00:03:23.069> placed<00:03:23.340> here

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
okay and the piston can be placed here

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.740 
okay and the piston can be placed here
now<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.280> old<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:26.849> pistons<00:03:27.209> are<00:03:27.449> in

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
now that the old of the pistons are in

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.339 
now that the old of the pistons are in
place<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.500> then<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.859> grab<00:03:29.129> a<00:03:29.400> deadlock<00:03:30.349> and

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
place and then you grab a deadlock and

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.189 
place and then you grab a deadlock and
now<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.680> make<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.449> the<00:03:33.449> place<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
now we can make the the place for the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.159 
now we can make the the place for the
pumpkins<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.919> melons<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.579> grow<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.780> we<00:03:36.989> need

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
pumpkins and melons to grow so we need

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.030 
pumpkins and melons to grow so we need
to<00:03:37.409> form<00:03:37.949> a<00:03:38.159> circle<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.599> here<00:03:40.229> so<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:40.889> is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
to form a circle in here so this is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610 
to form a circle in here so this is
where<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> table<00:03:41.609> fall<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.659> pumpkins

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
where the table fall down the pumpkins

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.979 
where the table fall down the pumpkins
and<00:03:43.680> melons<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.909> way<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.659> where<00:03:45.840> we

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
and melons and this way this is where we

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.580 
and melons and this way this is where we
will<00:03:46.169> plant<00:03:46.500> them<00:03:47.629> let's<00:03:48.629> make<00:03:48.840> another<00:03:49.079> floor

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
will plant them let's make another floor

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.409 
will plant them let's make another floor
I'm<00:03:49.859> going<00:03:49.919> to<00:03:50.190> show<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.400> how<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.819> can<00:03:50.970> extend

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
I'm going to show you how you can extend

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.460 
I'm going to show you how you can extend
this<00:03:51.680> all<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.829> need<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.159> do<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.870> continue<00:03:54.870> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
this all you need to do is continue the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:04.399 
this all you need to do is continue the
same<00:03:55.650> pattern<00:03:56.129> with<00:03:56.400> these<00:03:58.699> touch<00:03:59.699> towers<00:04:03.409> on

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
same pattern with these touch towers on

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.790 
same pattern with these touch towers on
all<00:04:04.620> four<00:04:05.010> keys<00:04:06.530> block<00:04:07.549> touch

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
all four keys block touch

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:20.650 
all four keys block touch
la<00:04:10.550> can<00:04:11.060> touch<00:04:13.960> one<00:04:14.960> more<00:04:19.060> now<00:04:20.060> that's<00:04:20.420> the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
la can touch one more now that's the

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.890 
la can touch one more now that's the
last<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.410> then<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.860> can<00:04:22.010> add<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
last one and then you can add the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:36.250 
last one and then you can add the
distance<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.480> dirt<00:04:29.720> ring<00:04:33.160> okay<00:04:35.200> now<00:04:36.200> we

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
distance and the dirt ring okay now we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.450 
distance and the dirt ring okay now we
can<00:04:36.500> plant<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.810> melons<00:04:38.810> our<00:04:38.960> pumpkins<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.400> you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
can plant the melons our pumpkins so you

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.830 
can plant the melons our pumpkins so you
want<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:41.060> go<00:04:41.240> down<00:04:41.900> here<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.820> start<00:04:43.840> hoeing

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
want to go down here and start hoeing

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.490 
want to go down here and start hoeing
these<00:04:45.260> corners<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.490> then<00:04:47.120> do<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.500> alternating

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
these corners and then do a alternating

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.980 
these corners and then do a alternating
pattern<00:04:48.920> so<00:04:49.190> melon<00:04:49.850> pumpkin<00:04:50.270> melon<00:04:50.510> pumpkin

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
pattern so melon pumpkin melon pumpkin

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290 
pattern so melon pumpkin melon pumpkin
and<00:04:51.140> then<00:04:51.680> if<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.460> want<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.790> can<00:04:52.910> grow<00:04:53.120> them

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
and then if you want you can grow them

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.910 
and then if you want you can grow them
with<00:04:53.480> bone<00:04:53.720> meal<00:04:54.020> just<00:04:54.560> speed<00:04:54.770> things<00:04:55.070> up

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
with bone meal just speed things up

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:06.970 
with bone meal just speed things up
other<00:04:57.920> layer<00:05:03.310> all<00:05:04.310> right<00:05:04.990> last<00:05:05.990> one<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.530> then

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
other layer all right last one and then

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.730 
other layer all right last one and then
we<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.580> course<00:05:07.640> need<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.240> add<00:05:08.810> some<00:05:09.080> light<00:05:09.350> and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
we of course need to add some light and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.220 
we of course need to add some light and
the<00:05:10.730> easiest<00:05:11.060> place<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:12.110> here<00:05:13.900> if<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.050> want

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
the easiest place is in here if you want

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.620 
the easiest place is in here if you want
to<00:05:15.290> use<00:05:15.500> closed<00:05:15.770> tone<00:05:16.040> you<00:05:16.160> can<00:05:16.220> also<00:05:16.580> use<00:05:17.090> this

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
to use closed tone you can also use this

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.440 
to use closed tone you can also use this
place<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:20.530> but<00:05:21.530> I'm<00:05:22.130> using<00:05:22.550> torches<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.330> the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
place here but I'm using torches in the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.610 
place here but I'm using torches in the
middle<00:05:24.280> let's<00:05:25.280> then<00:05:26.030> add<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.630> gathering

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
middle let's then add the gathering

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.570 
middle let's then add the gathering
mechanism<00:05:28.160> or<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:29.030> hopper<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.919> chest<00:05:31.220> so

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
mechanism or the hopper and the chest so

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.430 
mechanism or the hopper and the chest so
we<00:05:31.610> need<00:05:31.940> to<00:05:32.090> place<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.540> chest<00:05:32.870> in<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.870> here

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
we need to place the chest in in here

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.460 
we need to place the chest in in here
oops<00:05:36.919> that's<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.430> wrong<00:05:37.810> way<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.050> okay

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
oops that's the wrong way but okay

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.260 
oops that's the wrong way but okay
let's<00:05:39.800> let's<00:05:40.130> leave<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.490> like<00:05:40.910> that<00:05:41.090> and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
let's let's leave it that like that and

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.460 
let's let's leave it that like that and
then<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.110> place<00:05:42.350> hoppers<00:05:42.860> here<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.340> here

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
then you place hoppers here and here

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.330 
then you place hoppers here and here
since<00:05:45.470> hopper<00:05:45.800> is<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.040> transparent<00:05:46.820> block<00:05:48.340> it

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
since hopper is a transparent block it

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.730 
since hopper is a transparent block it
won't<00:05:49.669> affect<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.390> light<00:05:51.020> level<00:05:51.380> on<00:05:51.530> this

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
won't affect the light level on this

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.400 
won't affect the light level on this
even<00:05:52.220> though<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:52.760> cover<00:05:53.419> this<00:05:53.630> up<00:05:53.870> or<00:05:54.140> I

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
even though that you cover this up or I

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.570 
even though that you cover this up or I
place<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.760> ground<00:05:55.940> I<00:05:56.919> just<00:05:57.919> make<00:05:58.340> sure
