in addition to it being an acute and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.750 
in addition to it being an acute and
small<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:31.230> actually<00:02:31.650> two<00:02:31.829> times<00:02:32.099> louder

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760

than<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.390> factory<00:02:33.720> horn<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:34.799> really

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
than the factory horn and that's really

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.009 
than the factory horn and that's really
what<00:02:35.280> we're<00:02:35.430> getting<00:02:35.519> at<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.030> main<00:02:36.630> reason

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
what we're getting at the main reason

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.319 
what we're getting at the main reason
that<00:02:37.049> we're<00:02:37.260> installing<00:02:38.000> aftermarket<00:02:39.000> horns

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
that we're installing aftermarket horns

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.759 
that we're installing aftermarket horns
on<00:02:39.450> our<00:02:39.569> motorcycles<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.650> be

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
on our motorcycles and so it can be

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.920 
on our motorcycles and so it can be
heard<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> road<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.239> safety<00:02:42.569> on<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
heard on the road know the safety on the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.569 
heard on the road know the safety on the
road<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.319> absolutely<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> most<00:02:43.950> important

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
road is absolutely the most important

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.490 
road is absolutely the most important
thing<00:02:44.700> we're<00:02:44.849> looking<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.630> far<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.349> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
thing we're looking for as far as the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.069 
thing we're looking for as far as the
addition<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.610> horn<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> motorcycle<00:02:48.299> we

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
addition of a horn to the motorcycle we

so<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.810> wiring<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.440> mounting<00:02:55.799> difficult

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
so is wiring and mounting difficult

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.800 
so is wiring and mounting difficult
supports<00:02:56.880> most<00:02:57.209> people<00:02:57.450> make<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.690> mistake
