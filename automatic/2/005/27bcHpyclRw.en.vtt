onto<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.329> string<00:01:53.630> we're<00:01:53.780> going<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:53.960> take

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
onto that string we're going to take

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.469 
onto that string we're going to take
that<00:01:54.560> finger<00:01:54.770> off<00:01:55.009> that<00:01:55.039> string<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.360> have

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
that finger off that string so we have

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.649 
that finger off that string so we have
an<00:01:56.720> open<00:01:57.470> string<00:01:57.860> on<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.399> thinny<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.060> that's

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
an open string on the thinny and that's

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.140 
an open string on the thinny and that's
going<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.869> sound<00:02:00.049> like<00:02:00.140> this

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.180 

so<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.230> said<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.530> best<00:02:06.650> way<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.890> remember

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
so like I said the best way to remember

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.969 
so like I said the best way to remember
this<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.640> there's<00:02:08.000> veggie<00:02:08.270> d<00:02:08.710> suspended<00:02:09.710> for

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this is there's veggie d suspended for

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.480 
this is there's veggie d suspended for
has<00:02:10.250> four<00:02:10.520> fingers<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:12.050> spat<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> too<00:02:12.710> has<00:02:13.220> two

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
has four fingers and spat it too has two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.190 
has four fingers and spat it too has two
fingers

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.450 

let<00:02:17.200> me<00:02:17.290> show<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.560> cool<00:02:17.740> right<00:02:18.040> handed

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
let me show you a cool right handed

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.970 
let me show you a cool right handed
technique<00:02:18.700> which<00:02:19.210> we're<00:02:19.360> going<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.570> use<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
technique which we're going to use to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.620 
technique which we're going to use to
look<00:02:21.130> at<00:02:21.250> an<00:02:21.340> arpeggiated<00:02:21.880> style<00:02:21.970> pattern<00:02:22.390> for

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
look at an arpeggiated style pattern for

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.780 
look at an arpeggiated style pattern for
this<00:02:22.750> song<00:02:22.980> okay<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.220> let's<00:02:24.340> imagine<00:02:24.460> any

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
this song okay so let's imagine any

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.370 
this song okay so let's imagine any
other<00:02:24.820> left<00:02:25.090> hand<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.510> fingers<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.900> addy

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
other left hand on the fingers of addy

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.290 
other left hand on the fingers of addy
so<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> pigmen<00:02:27.550> pattern<00:02:27.850> we're<00:02:27.940> going<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.150> use

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
so the pigmen pattern we're going to use

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.670 
so the pigmen pattern we're going to use
is<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> be<00:02:28.810> similar<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.140> one<00:02:29.320> we<00:02:29.470> didn't

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
is going to be similar to one we didn't

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.430 
is going to be similar to one we didn't
intermediate<00:02:30.190> chords<00:02:30.580> number<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.270> start<00:02:32.200> on

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
intermediate chords number to start on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.220 
intermediate chords number to start on
the<00:02:32.530> D<00:02:32.710> string<00:02:32.740> I'm<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.550> pick<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.850> damn

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the D string I'm going to pick that damn

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.380 
the D string I'm going to pick that damn
the<00:02:35.230> B<00:02:35.380> string<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.830> i'm<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.820> pick<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> g

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the B string up i'm going to pick the g

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.330 
the B string up i'm going to pick the g
string<00:02:37.600> down<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:39.490> E<00:02:39.520> string<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.860> then

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
string down the E string up and and then

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.070 
string down the E string up and and then
I'll<00:02:42.640> take<00:02:42.910> two<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.270> second<00:02:43.660> bit<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.990> a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
I'll take two to the second bit in a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.570 
I'll take two to the second bit in a
minute<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.920> bit<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.400> sound

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
minute but that bit it's going to sound

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.430 
minute but that bit it's going to sound
like<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.850> if<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.540> last<00:02:49.810> bit<00:02:50.110> we're<00:02:50.320> going

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
like this and if it last bit we're going

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.740 
like this and if it last bit we're going
to<00:02:50.530> come<00:02:50.709> down<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.640> strings<00:02:51.970> EBG<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:55.600> all

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
to come down the strings EBG and all

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.500 
to come down the strings EBG and all
together<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.410> going<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.740> sound<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.190> this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.899 

so<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.290> was<00:03:02.439> with<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.830> D<00:03:03.040> chord<00:03:03.459> if<00:03:03.580> we<00:03:03.700> played

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
so that was with a D chord if we played

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.400 
so that was with a D chord if we played
over<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.120> basis<00:03:04.659> for<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:04.959> sound<00:03:05.319> like<00:03:05.349> this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.059 

and<00:03:09.950> eat<00:03:10.130> us<00:03:10.340> too

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.580 

so<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:15.390> example<00:03:15.450> if<00:03:15.749> we<00:03:15.870> wanted<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.109> go<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.319> G

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
so for example if we wanted to go to a G

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.199 
so for example if we wanted to go to a G
chord<00:03:16.799> all<00:03:17.099> we're<00:03:17.280> changing<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.909> first

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
chord all we're changing is that first

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.149 
chord all we're changing is that first
note<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.689> instead<00:03:18.900> apply<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.170> D<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.920> B

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
note so instead apply to D to the B

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.819 
note so instead apply to D to the B
string<00:03:20.459> we're<00:03:20.969> going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> play<00:03:21.359> an<00:03:21.629> e<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
string we're going to play an e to the

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.459 
string we're going to play an e to the
be<00:03:23.099> so<00:03:23.489> remember<00:03:23.849> then<00:03:23.999> the<00:03:24.540> bass<00:03:24.689> note<00:03:24.930> 4g<00:03:25.139> is

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:25.469 
be so remember then the bass note 4g is

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:30.520 
be so remember then the bass note 4g is
up<00:03:25.620> there

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.250 

and<00:03:30.830> then<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.240> wanted<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.510> go<00:03:32.600> array<00:03:32.840> or<00:03:33.170> in

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
and then so we wanted to go array or in

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.660 
and then so we wanted to go array or in
this<00:03:33.350> case<00:03:33.410> we're<00:03:33.740> going<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.920> go<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.130> seven

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
this case we're going to go to a seven

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.840 
this case we're going to go to a seven
subs<00:03:34.910> for<00:03:36.010> we're<00:03:37.010> going<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.220> we're<00:03:37.700> going<00:03:37.790> to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
subs for we're going to we're going to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.070 
subs for we're going to we're going to
apply<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.240> string<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.720> bottom

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.860 

so<00:03:43.710> that's<00:03:44.400> pretty<00:03:44.640> much<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.850> right<00:03:45.330> hand<00:03:45.630> and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
so that's pretty much the right hand and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.820 
so that's pretty much the right hand and
you<00:03:45.930> should<00:03:46.080> be<00:03:46.110> pretty<00:03:46.350> familiar<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.800> that

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you should be pretty familiar with that

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.710 
you should be pretty familiar with that
because<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.430> covered<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.970> very<00:03:48.450> similar

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
because we covered a very similar

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.900 
because we covered a very similar
section<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.740> intermediate<00:03:50.250> chords

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
section to that in intermediate chords

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.300 
section to that in intermediate chords
number<00:03:51.600> one<00:03:51.780> okay<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:52.710> let's<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.130> look<00:03:53.160> at

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
number one okay so let's have a look at

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.410 
number one okay so let's have a look at
the<00:03:53.370> chord<00:03:53.580> progression<00:03:53.970> way<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.120> play<00:03:54.360> this

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
the chord progression way to play this

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
the chord progression way to play this
song<00:03:54.780> we're<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.290> start<00:03:55.350> with<00:03:55.590> D<00:03:55.770> sucks

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
song we're going to start with D sucks

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
going to mess around with some different

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.930 
going to mess around with some different
striking<00:04:25.140> techniques<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.340> idea<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.730> this

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
striking techniques and the idea of this

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.630 
striking techniques and the idea of this
is<00:04:27.590> we're<00:04:28.590> going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.800> use<00:04:28.920> techniques<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.460> or

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
is we're going to use techniques you or

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.430 
is we're going to use techniques you or
you<00:04:29.760> learn<00:04:29.970> or<00:04:30.180> recovered<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.870> idea<00:04:31.320> is

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
you learn or recovered and the idea is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.950 
you learn or recovered and the idea is
to<00:04:31.500> have<00:04:31.920> a<00:04:32.040> listen<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.520> me<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.940> try<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.510> sort

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
to have a listen to me and try and sort

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
to have a listen to me and try and sort
of<00:04:34.050> pick<00:04:34.440> up<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.680> field<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.280> song<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.880> like

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
sort of play along with me keep in mind

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.590 
sort of play along with me keep in mind
you're<00:04:40.080> sort<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.500> been<00:04:40.620> able<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.980> play<00:04:41.130> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
you're sort of been able to play the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.570 
you're sort of been able to play the
arpeggios<00:04:42.600> when<00:04:43.020> Armstrong<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.710> vice<00:04:44.250> versa

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
arpeggios when Armstrong and vice versa

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.990 
arpeggios when Armstrong and vice versa
so<00:04:45.000> their<00:04:45.540> Padres<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:46.080> Australia<00:04:46.560> sort<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.000> can

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
so their Padres in Australia sort of can

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.290 
so their Padres in Australia sort of can
can<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.330> played<00:04:48.570> over<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.320> top<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.620> each<00:04:49.800> other

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
can be played over the top of each other

00:04:50.300 --> 00:05:42.620 
can be played over the top of each other
one<00:04:51.300> two<00:04:51.720> three<00:04:52.020> four

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.020

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.690 
so that gives you sort of a bit of an
idea<00:05:45.150> of<00:05:45.480> what<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.780> can<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:46.050> with<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.620> D<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.670> D

word and they want to sort of turn into

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.330 
word and they want to sort of turn into
a<00:06:04.470> lake<00:06:04.680> accord<00:06:05.010> so<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.970> D<00:06:06.150> sauce<00:06:06.980> also<00:06:07.980> turn

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
when it finishes on its major so that

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.159 
when it finishes on its major so that
that's<00:06:16.210> what<00:06:16.389> you<00:06:16.509> can<00:06:16.660> use<00:06:16.840> them<00:06:17.020> in

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
that's what you can use them in

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.830 
that's what you can use them in
conjunction<00:06:17.650> together<00:06:17.860> so<00:06:18.570> we're<00:06:19.570> def

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
conjunction together so we're def

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.379 
conjunction together so we're def
definitely<00:06:20.110> do<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.470> lot<00:06:20.680> more<00:06:20.710> work<00:06:21.070> on<00:06:21.389> using

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
definitely do a lot more work on using
