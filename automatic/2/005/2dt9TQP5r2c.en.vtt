 hello everyone today I want to announce that we are going to have a new 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.790
 series of free video tutorials to those who provided them with how to create a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.570
 flash game and what a good game the eta fire treats the eggs of the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.289
 chicken 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.669
 it's nothing new everything we've played is the classic game where we have the chicken 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.260
 alive and with a low basket we try to catch the eggs 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.350
 let's have a new video tutorial of this series every day was going to be 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.320

 i the game that we are going to create good is more or less this here I have a 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.970
 beta version of the game but this essentially everything that we are going to create 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.700
 we have the basket under which you are controlling with the arrow keys 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.690
 and as that is pretty smooth the animation until it comes back a bit 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.010
 basket for example wants left right i obviously all that is the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.690
 counter of the games is to detect that the new ones touch to basket and the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.680
