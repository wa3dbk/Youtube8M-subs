00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the latest technology together you have

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.790 
the latest technology together you have
these<00:01:10.870> refrigerant<00:01:11.870> that<00:01:12.050> runs<00:01:12.350> through<00:01:12.650> it

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
these refrigerant that runs through it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.680 
these refrigerant that runs through it
the<00:01:13.190> machine<00:01:13.520> keeps<00:01:13.820> measuring<00:01:14.570> the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the machine keeps measuring the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.030 
the machine keeps measuring the
temperature<00:01:14.840> making<00:01:15.590> sure<00:01:15.710> you're<00:01:15.890> not

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
temperature making sure you're not

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040 
temperature making sure you're not
overdoing<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.180> there's<00:01:17.690> three<00:01:17.870> different

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
overdoing it and there's three different

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.110 
overdoing it and there's three different
handpieces<00:01:18.620> different<00:01:19.160> sizes<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> biggest

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
handpieces different sizes the biggest

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.880 
handpieces different sizes the biggest
one<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.420> about<00:01:20.630> three<00:01:20.900> times<00:01:21.080> bigger<00:01:21.710> than

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
one is about three times bigger than

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.220 
one is about three times bigger than
this<00:01:22.190> for<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.000> valley<00:01:23.180> for<00:01:23.570> me<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.900> did<00:01:24.200> my

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
this for the valley for me I did my

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.000 
this for the valley for me I did my
belly<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.830> then<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:24.980> did<00:01:25.220> my<00:01:25.250> sides<00:01:25.670> so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
belly and then I did my sides so

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.110 
belly and then I did my sides so
basically<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:28.280> turn<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.760> machine<00:01:29.030> on

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
basically you just turn the machine on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.640 
basically you just turn the machine on
if<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.390> touch<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.810> cooling<00:01:30.170> plains<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.500> see

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
if you touch the cooling plains you see

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.560 
if you touch the cooling plains you see
how<00:01:30.770> they're<00:01:31.010> cold<00:01:31.310> yeah<00:01:31.940> it's<00:01:32.120> very<00:01:32.330> safe<00:01:32.540> to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
how they're cold yeah it's very safe to

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.110 
how they're cold yeah it's very safe to
touch<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.620> it<00:01:33.770> really<00:01:33.980> freezes<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> four

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
touch so it really freezes it to four

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.270 
touch so it really freezes it to four
degrees<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.320> put<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.830> colder<00:01:37.190> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
degrees so you put it in colder and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.040 
degrees so you put it in colder and
colder<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.640> colder<00:01:37.790> learn<00:01:38.090> exactly<00:01:38.270> turn

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
colder and colder learn exactly turn

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.630 
colder and colder learn exactly turn
onto<00:01:39.200> your<00:01:39.320> side<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:40.070> let's<00:01:40.250> say<00:01:40.310> someone<00:01:40.520> like

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
onto your side so let's say someone like

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.200 
onto your side so let's say someone like
you<00:01:40.940> comes<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.870> just<00:01:42.080> go<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.500> side<00:01:43.210> success

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
you comes we just go to the side success

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.180 
you comes we just go to the side success
can<00:01:44.420> increase<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.140> four<00:01:45.470> degrees<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:45.980> one

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
can increase it four degrees you one

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.010 
can increase it four degrees you one

called<00:02:06.009> belt<00:02:06.310> eat<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.330> does<00:02:07.539> is<00:02:07.600> it

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
called belt eat and what it does is it

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.990 
called belt eat and what it does is it
chills<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.590> fat<00:02:08.800> specifically<00:02:09.580> around<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
waistband causes it to crystallize and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.220 
waistband causes it to crystallize and

fat specifically chills the fat in this
area<00:02:21.060> crystallize<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.959> you're<00:02:23.200> going

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
area crystallize and then you're going

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530 
area crystallize and then you're going
to<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.620> these<00:02:23.799> these<00:02:24.100> immune<00:02:24.790> cells<00:02:25.060> come<00:02:25.390> in

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
fat metabolites how long does that take

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.830 
fat metabolites how long does that take
this<00:02:30.130> takes<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.670> two<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.030> four<00:02:31.360> months<00:02:31.600> so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
this takes about two to four months so

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.199 
this takes about two to four months so
this<00:02:31.959> is<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> gradual<00:02:32.739> process<00:02:32.799> and<00:02:33.670> people

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
this is a gradual process and people

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.759 
this is a gradual process and people
start<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.569> notice<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.959> they<00:02:35.080> feel<00:02:35.260> better<00:02:35.560> in

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
start to notice that they feel better in
