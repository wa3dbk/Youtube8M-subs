the coop report it shows specifically

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
the coop report it shows specifically
how<00:00:42.480> enter<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.870> individual<00:00:43.350> students<00:00:43.800> are

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it shows specific weaknesses and those

weaknesses are in alignment with the
exact<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:51.059> matrices<00:00:51.840> areas<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> NBR<00:00:54.629> see

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
exact same matrices areas as the NBR see

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
exact same matrices areas as the NBR see
so<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> specific<00:00:56.460> content

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so you can look at a specific content

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670 
so you can look at a specific content
area<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.300> they'll<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> column<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
area and they'll have a column there and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
area and they'll have a column there and
in<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.280> cases<00:00:59.550> if<00:01:00.090> you're<00:01:00.180> printing<00:01:00.480> your

in some cases if you're printing your

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
in some cases if you're printing your
report<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.320> color<00:01:01.590> it'll<00:01:02.129> show<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
report out in color it'll show that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
report out in color it'll show that
you're<00:01:02.820> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.210> red<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.629> some<00:01:03.870> places<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
we find and we've worked with several

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.270 
we find and we've worked with several
universities<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:19.590> reality<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
universities on this that in reality you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.940 
universities on this that in reality you
could<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.970> minor<00:01:21.509> changes<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.799> your

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
could make just minor changes to your

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.899 
could make just minor changes to your
syllabus<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.880> different<00:01:24.780> courses<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
syllabus in different courses and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
syllabus in different courses and
drastically<00:01:26.909> changed<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.770> performance

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
drastically changed the performance

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
drastically changed the performance
level<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.189> our<00:01:29.310> students<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.820> here's<00:01:30.270> how

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
level that our students and here's how

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
level that our students and here's how
you<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.900> what<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.799> find<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:33.360> we

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you do that what we find is that when we

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
you do that what we find is that when we
go<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> generate<00:01:34.170> an<00:01:34.290> exam<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:34.920> logged<00:01:35.280> in

do<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.820> access<00:01:48.420> our<00:01:48.829> database<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
do is you can access our database of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
do is you can access our database of
questions<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.390> remember<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.439> write

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
questions that remember we don't write

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
questions that remember we don't write
exactly<00:01:53.189> word<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:53.970> word<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.899> B<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.079> C

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
exactly word for word like the in B or C

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.749 
exactly word for word like the in B or C
we're<00:01:55.530> not<00:01:55.680> allowed<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.460> wouldn't

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we're not allowed to do that we wouldn't

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
we're not allowed to do that we wouldn't
do<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.000> anyway<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.290> right<00:01:58.530> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
do that anyway what we do right is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.020 
do that anyway what we do right is
questions<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> are<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.430> similar<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
questions that are very similar and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.230 
questions that are very similar and
cover<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:01.110> similar<00:02:01.619> topics<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.030> there's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
cover very similar topics so if there's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.139 
cover very similar topics so if there's
a<00:02:03.299> specific<00:02:03.829> focus<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.040> some<00:02:05.340> aspect<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.000> an

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
a specific focus on some aspect of an

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.880 
a specific focus on some aspect of an
airway<00:02:06.540> we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.439> sure<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.710> write

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
airway we're going to make sure we write

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.529 
airway we're going to make sure we write
questions<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.550> focus<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.420> on

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
questions that focus is a little bit on

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.170 
questions that focus is a little bit on
that<00:02:09.590> specific<00:02:10.590> aspect<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.160> well<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that specific aspect as well and so

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910 
that specific aspect as well and so
let's<00:02:12.420> say<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.080> say<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.319> want<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> stay

at all of the questions in our database
from<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.890> area<00:02:53.310> keeping<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.269> mind<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.840> they

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
from that area keeping in mind that they

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.590 
from that area keeping in mind that they
can<00:02:55.200> be<00:02:55.530> very<00:02:55.739> similar<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.519> very<00:02:57.060> helpful<00:02:57.330> in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
can be very similar and very helpful in

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.539 
can be very similar and very helpful in
preparing<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.200> actual<00:02:58.560> exam<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.459> I

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
preparing for the actual exam and so I

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.699 
preparing for the actual exam and so I
can<00:02:59.730> generate<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.390> exam<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.110> here's<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
can generate this exam and here's a

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.770 
can generate this exam and here's a
question<00:03:02.040> now<00:03:02.730> interestingly<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.569> gonna

so<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.140> can<00:03:37.440> sit<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:38.130> group<00:03:38.670> with<00:03:38.910> instructors

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
so I can sit as a group with instructors

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.140 
so I can sit as a group with instructors
and<00:03:39.780> go<00:03:40.320> through<00:03:40.590> here<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.160> read<00:03:41.760> these

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and go through here and read these

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.690 
and go through here and read these
including<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> rationale<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.739> what<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.430> find

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
including the rationale and what we find

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670 
including the rationale and what we find
is<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.120> occasionally<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> structure

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
is that occasionally in the structure

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.400 
is that occasionally in the structure
who<00:03:46.799> has<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.549> class<00:03:48.030> we'll<00:03:48.810> say<00:03:49.019> well<00:03:49.260> yeah<00:03:49.380> I

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
who has that class we'll say well yeah I

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.430 
who has that class we'll say well yeah I
teach<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.160> about<00:03:50.609> heliox<00:03:51.269> but<00:03:52.079> I<00:03:52.109> don't

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
teach that about heliox but I don't

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.190 
teach that about heliox but I don't
teach<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:53.010> specific<00:03:53.790> fact<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.989> they're

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
teach this specific fact that they're

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.229 
teach this specific fact that they're
bringing<00:03:55.620> out<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.549> what<00:03:56.670> we<00:03:56.790> find<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.180> that

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
bringing out and so what we find is that

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.250 
bringing out and so what we find is that
an<00:03:57.569> instructor<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.410> make<00:03:58.739> very<00:03:59.160> minor

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
an instructor can make very minor

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.530 
an instructor can make very minor
responses<00:04:01.260> or<00:04:01.620> minor<00:04:02.250> changes<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.030> should<00:04:03.269> say

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
responses or minor changes I should say

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930 
responses or minor changes I should say
to<00:04:04.019> their<00:04:04.170> syllabus<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.799> make<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> drastic

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
to their syllabus and make a drastic

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.789 
to their syllabus and make a drastic
difference<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.569> way<00:04:06.720> students<00:04:07.410> perform

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
difference on the way students perform

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.680 
difference on the way students perform
on<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.100> exam<00:04:08.459> we've<00:04:08.850> done<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.269> with<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> few

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
on the exam we've done this with a few

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.569 
on the exam we've done this with a few
colleges<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.200> universities<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:10.950> they<00:04:11.400> have

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
colleges and universities and they have

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.610 
colleges and universities and they have
reported<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.239> just<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.600> remarkable<00:04:13.290> change

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
reported a just a remarkable change

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.590 
reported a just a remarkable change
where<00:04:14.190> they've<00:04:14.370> shifted<00:04:14.639> from<00:04:15.000> being<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.420> weak

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
where they've shifted from being a weak

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.140 
where they've shifted from being a weak
area<00:04:15.840> below<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.799> national<00:04:16.979> average<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.880> just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
area below the national average to just

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.909 
area below the national average to just
instantly<00:04:18.720> becoming<00:04:19.260> above<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> national

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
instantly becoming above the national

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.039 
instantly becoming above the national
average<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.489> why<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.239> happening<00:04:21.359> because

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
average and why is it happening because

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
average and why is it happening because
there's<00:04:22.409> just<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.710> few<00:04:23.130> details<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:24.120> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
there's just a few details that that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.390 
there's just a few details that that
instructor<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.080> anticipated<00:04:25.950> maybe<00:04:26.099> even

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
instructor is not anticipated maybe even

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.350 
instructor is not anticipated maybe even
just<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.669> fact<00:04:26.970> here

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
just a fact here

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029 
just a fact here
there<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.169> they<00:04:28.319> don't<00:04:28.530> include<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.919> in

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
there and so they don't include it in

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.249 
there and so they don't include it in
their<00:04:29.159> teaching<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.810> unknowingly<00:04:30.810> it's

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
their teaching and unknowingly it's

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.559 
their teaching and unknowingly it's
actually<00:04:31.710> on<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.039> exam<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.849> so<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> hope

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
actually on the exam and so that I hope

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.330 
actually on the exam and so that I hope
