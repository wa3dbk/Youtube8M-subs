centric<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:31.149> was<00:01:31.509> thinking<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.780> maybe<00:01:31.899> Bidoof

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
centric I was thinking that maybe Bidoof

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.020 
centric I was thinking that maybe Bidoof
will<00:01:32.500> only<00:01:32.679> be<00:01:32.890> available<00:01:33.100> limited<00:01:33.490> time<00:01:33.820> for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
will only be available limited time for

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.060 
will only be available limited time for
one<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.630> one<00:01:34.780> time<00:01:34.990> today<00:01:35.170> which<00:01:35.439> make<00:01:35.679> Bidoof

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
one for one time today which make Bidoof

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.859 
one for one time today which make Bidoof
like<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.399> ultimate<00:01:36.820> rare<00:01:37.060> Pokemon<00:01:37.600> because

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
like the ultimate rare Pokemon because

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.800 
like the ultimate rare Pokemon because
they're<00:01:37.990> only<00:01:38.200> available<00:01:38.979> one<00:01:39.189> day<00:01:39.399> I<00:01:39.810> think

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
they're only available one day I think

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.910 
they're only available one day I think
that'd<00:01:40.929> be<00:01:40.960> actually<00:01:41.289> really<00:01:41.439> funny<00:01:41.770> and

have to talk to talk to a scientist so

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.089 
have to talk to talk to a scientist so
let's<00:02:07.209> see<00:02:07.330> if<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.509> is<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.689> guy<00:02:08.099> scientist

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
let's see if this is the guy scientist

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.240 
let's see if this is the guy scientist
annotations<00:02:10.030> seems<00:02:10.959> like<00:02:11.140> route<00:02:11.349> 29<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.950> open

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250

think that right over there over there
that's<00:02:37.319> route<00:02:37.530> 29<00:02:38.239> maybe<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.569> the

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
that's route 29 maybe this is the

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.720 
that's route 29 maybe this is the
scientist<00:02:40.109> oh<00:02:41.719> here<00:02:42.719> we<00:02:42.810> go

clue number one the suttas scientist

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.170 
clue number one the suttas scientist
isn't<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.829> tall<00:03:08.069> building<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.639> shakes<00:03:08.909> like<00:03:09.120> a

isn't a tall building that shakes like a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
isn't a tall building that shakes like a
Bellsprout<00:03:09.810> go<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.500> go

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
Bellsprout go go go

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.689 
Bellsprout go go go
I<00:03:11.099> think<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.909> know<00:03:11.969> where<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:13.069> damn<00:03:14.069> dude

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
I think I know where that is damn dude

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:35.650 
I think I know where that is damn dude
you<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.969> to<00:03:15.120> do

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.580 

okay<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.720> we're<00:03:37.140> heading<00:03:37.380> up<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
okay so we're heading up to the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.860 
okay so we're heading up to the
Bellsprout<00:03:38.250> tower<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:41.690> think<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.810> is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
Bellsprout tower now I think this is

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.600 
Bellsprout tower now I think this is
only<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.440> level<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.770> dog<00:03:43.890> spots<00:03:44.160> higher<00:03:44.340> so

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
only one level the dog spots higher so

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.070 
only one level the dog spots higher so
it<00:03:44.670> should<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.910> fairly<00:03:45.300> obvious<00:03:45.450> where<00:03:45.990> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
it should be fairly obvious where the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:56.060 
it should be fairly obvious where the
guy<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:50.180> let's<00:03:51.180> see<00:03:51.480> Arius<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.410> drink<00:03:55.830> I
