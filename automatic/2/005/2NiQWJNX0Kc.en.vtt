is a slightly smaller valve design to
give<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.570> car<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.840> little<00:02:01.960> more<00:02:02.260> oomph<00:02:02.500> off

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
give this car a little more oomph off

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.450 
give this car a little more oomph off
the<00:02:02.950> line<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:04.390> also<00:02:04.570> has<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.260> special<00:02:05.680> camshaft

the engine and shakes when you start the

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
car which not only allows it to breathe

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.110 
car which not only allows it to breathe
better<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:15.280> gives<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.819> little<00:02:15.909> more

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
better but gives it a little more

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.809 
better but gives it a little more
attitude<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:17.349> Ford<00:02:17.709> was<00:02:17.890> able<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.220> take<00:02:18.519> their

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
attitude so Ford was able to take their

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.370 
attitude so Ford was able to take their
Windsor<00:02:19.510> block

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
Windsor block

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.960 
Windsor block
and<00:02:20.470> made<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.010> with<00:02:21.160> their<00:02:21.340> Cleveland

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and made it with their Cleveland

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.480 
and made it with their Cleveland
cylinder-head<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.990> come<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.220> special

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
cylinder-head and come up with special

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.330 
cylinder-head and come up with special
internals<00:02:25.150> for<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> 302<00:02:26.590> cubic<00:02:26.980> inch<00:02:27.160> engine

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
internals for a 302 cubic inch engine

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.490 
internals for a 302 cubic inch engine
and<00:02:27.730> that's<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.110> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
and that's what we have here and the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.840 
and that's what we have here and the
reason<00:02:29.650> they<00:02:29.890> went<00:02:30.070> with<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> Windsor<00:02:30.610> block

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
reason they went with the Windsor block

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.520 
reason they went with the Windsor block
and<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.450> Cleveland<00:02:31.870> head<00:02:32.050> again<00:02:32.440> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and the Cleveland head again the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
and the Cleveland head again the
Cleveland<00:02:32.980> was<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> different<00:02:33.880> engine<00:02:34.420> plant

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
Cleveland was a different engine plant

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.810 
Cleveland was a different engine plant
at<00:02:34.870> Ford<00:02:35.110> head<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.800> was<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.950> more<00:02:36.190> free-flowing

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
at Ford head it was a more free-flowing

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.540 
at Ford head it was a more free-flowing
cylinder<00:02:37.570> head<00:02:37.750> than<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.590> Windsor<00:02:39.100> head<00:02:39.340> that

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
cylinder head than the Windsor head that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.880 
cylinder head than the Windsor head that
would<00:02:39.670> have<00:02:39.760> normally<00:02:39.880> come<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.870> 302<00:02:41.140> so

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
would have normally come on the 302 so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.770 
would have normally come on the 302 so
it's<00:02:42.040> kind<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.310> hybrid<00:02:42.490> engine<00:02:42.820> design<00:02:43.330> they

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
it's kind of a hybrid engine design they

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.120 
it's kind of a hybrid engine design they
actually<00:02:44.110> had<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.350> shrink<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.830> valves<00:02:45.100> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
actually had to shrink the valves a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.520 
actually had to shrink the valves a
little<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.400> for<00:02:45.580> 1970<00:02:46.390> because<00:02:46.870> they<00:02:47.260> lost

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
little bit for 1970 because they lost

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.960 
little bit for 1970 because they lost
some<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.950> lower<00:02:48.130> end<00:02:48.400> torque<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.850> they

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
some of the lower end torque that they

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.330 
some of the lower end torque that they
were<00:02:49.030> looking<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.110> even<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.500> 1970<00:02:51.220> this

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
were looking for but even in 1970 this

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.390 
were looking for but even in 1970 this
thing<00:02:51.520> was<00:02:51.640> rated<00:02:51.910> at<00:02:51.970> 290<00:02:52.660> horsepower<00:02:53.400> 290

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
thing was rated at 290 horsepower 290

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.320 
thing was rated at 290 horsepower 290
foot-pounds<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.970> torque

foot-pounds of torque
at<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> very<00:02:55.960> conservative<00:02:57.090> 5,200<00:02:58.090> rpm<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
at a very conservative 5,200 rpm the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.410 
at a very conservative 5,200 rpm the
truth<00:02:59.770> was<00:03:00.010> these<00:03:00.250> cars<00:03:00.520> had<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> factory<00:03:01.210> rev

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
truth was these cars had a factory rev

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.310 
truth was these cars had a factory rev
limiter<00:03:01.810> set<00:03:02.710> just<00:03:02.950> over<00:03:03.220> 6100<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.750> we're<00:03:05.230> not

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
limiter set just over 6100 so we're not

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320 
limiter set just over 6100 so we're not
sure<00:03:05.380> about<00:03:05.650> those<00:03:05.980> power<00:03:06.190> numbers<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:07.090> think

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
sure about those power numbers we think

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.480 
sure about those power numbers we think
it<00:03:07.420> probably<00:03:07.720> still<00:03:07.930> made<00:03:08.200> power<00:03:08.500> after<00:03:08.890> that

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
it probably still made power after that

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.720 
it probably still made power after that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
5200 rpm rating it sure felt like that

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.130 
5200 rpm rating it sure felt like that
when<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.910> drove<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.300> that's<00:03:13.480> for<00:03:13.660> sure<00:03:13.870> and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
when you drove it that's for sure and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.200 
when you drove it that's for sure and

fun<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.650> think<00:03:57.520> car<00:03:57.700> designers<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> lot<00:03:58.870> of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.630 
fun I think car designers have a lot of
opportunities<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.680> overdo<00:04:00.430> it

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
opportunities to overdo it

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.000 
opportunities to overdo it
especially<00:04:01.270> on<00:04:01.360> special<00:04:01.900> editions<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.770> and
