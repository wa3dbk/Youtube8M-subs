alter ego Curt Connors as a scientist
he's<00:01:11.880> also<00:01:12.270> probably<00:01:12.869> smarter<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.590> well<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
he's also probably smarter as well and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
he's also probably smarter as well and
that<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.780> find<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> lizard

that was all I could find on the lizard

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
that was all I could find on the lizard
now<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.250> time<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.759> move<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> super

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
now it's time to move on to the super

now it's time to move on to the super
lichen<00:01:19.250> he<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> werewolf<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.869> he's

lichen he is a werewolf as well as he's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
lichen he is a werewolf as well as he's
been<00:01:22.259> alive<00:01:22.530> longer<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.400> by<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.670> logic<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
been alive longer so by that logic you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
been alive longer so by that logic you
think<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.590> fighting

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
think you have a lot more fighting

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.999 
think you have a lot more fighting
experience<00:01:27.170> with<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.619> being<00:01:28.860> said

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
experience with all that being said

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
experience with all that being said
which<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.420> win<00:01:30.630> between

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
which one do I think would win between

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
which one do I think would win between
the<00:01:31.229> super<00:01:31.560> lichen<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> lizard<00:01:32.670> I'm
