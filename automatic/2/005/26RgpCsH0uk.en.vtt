00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.669
 a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.300
 in its own words, several respects a follower 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 throughout the race 46 pieces of car that was out due Friday were great 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.310
 convenience for the Asians the German language only much later within that group of Germans 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.530
 all those back then 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 but this plane doesn't have much more important this car is in 3d it is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 the very first production that has the ratio 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.900
 and that is not exactly a head start due to technology 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.180
 he needs a bit of nuance and audi is a 1089 god with export 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.960
 with three cars then came through nicely at the end of 2008 the shed were six meters through 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.710
 3m was a very long time ago 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.580
 hence those who sift with a hybrid powertrain that we already know from the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580
 production you go to and volkswagen touareg 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.370
 Then you would assume that oil in these wooden powertrains ordered 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.620
 stopped as in the cayenne and the touareg but that and so not done with the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.890
 simple reason he was too big and fits 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.140
 she went through in the back 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.530
 in the front, we now have a two liter four-cylinder tfsi engine gasoline engine 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.330
 behind that there are ordinary mechanical problems against this in shares and 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.080
 cash 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.510
 then you get a multiple then moved or friend and then you get this 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.550
 8-speed automatic sales and therefore no more 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.930
 that has bart link then you are talking about 2008 head on form that much 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.220
 is larger 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.450
 Without too much more going outside conversation means you get this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.350
 opening hours completely on gasoline 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.360
 you can also fully lead the lecturer to even 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.220
 f the combination of both and they are doing well now that it is the cause 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.790
 a boost function so follow if you know maximum speed you have 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.010
 245 hp and 480 twenty meters and that is quite mandatory 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.959
 truckers like it on both engines 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.090
 driving is that we are less playful laid out is a challenge I am you anyway 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.260
 time and time again than I am driving on electricity alone 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.439
 nearly a hundred officially the subject goes 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.939
 I'm only Jorgacevic FC Utrecht FC Utrecht has gotten dread fear 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.980
 does not exist and yes 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.100
 therefore everyone thought that would be the case and I think you really have something 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.979
 need someone but to register so nice 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.369
 in practice 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.599
 we drive buses bicker caarten little is still a big part of the church street 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.339
 not with this because you are off the gas I am talking about the TV 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.119
 pot 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.169
 and then you just go big difference at the small streets 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.010
 she no longer becomes that sound of tires not much more than a children's bicycle 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:14.129
 in combination with mean in the middle of it is also me below 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.639
 took the army that also means you get this victory 7 come thoroughly 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.819
 wants to investigate the competition to make less use of 629 to 100 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.819
 kilometer the 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.419
 I am equally unaware of the wonderful, all too good practices 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.809
 but i knew wellink was at that time 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:42.579
 it is a certain next week that is so if you are only on electoral requirements 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.839
 that that petrol engine on and year with 10 simple also means for 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.749
 what you think about the ceiling 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:53.599
 and that he gets at game is clear that this area is better for that 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.059
 each other 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:59.430
 audi has chosen wilders in this hybrid for a gasoline and diesel engine 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:04.239
 has to do with the market he expects this type of hybrid car it is mainly 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.089
 very good about the future in the united states and china and there it is 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.309
 are still a very small poor child 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.639
 this q5 hybrid is definitely an asset it is nice and beautiful 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.560
 user friendly it looks good 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.919
 we still have to be patient with that comes to an end so that is real 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.680
 beautiful the woman becomes very important car of course the first steps that the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.919
 world and moreover, this powertrain will soon also be available in the 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 effenaar 6 he became hard at work that same night 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:33.710
