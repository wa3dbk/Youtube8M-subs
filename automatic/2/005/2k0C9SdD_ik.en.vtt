00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
tree and activate tree faller so it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360 
tree and activate tree faller so it
chops<00:00:36.300> down<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> blocks<00:00:38.190> around

the<00:00:38.780> log<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.070> chop<00:00:41.070> down<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:42.920> just

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the log you chop down and then just

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
the log you chop down and then just
continue<00:00:44.430> dropping<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.180> tree<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
continue dropping down the tree if you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
continue dropping down the tree if you
are<00:00:47.460> afraid<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> doing<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> wild
