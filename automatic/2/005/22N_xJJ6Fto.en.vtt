00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.940
 the new exercise of the lanyard of 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.790
 tactic this time as you see we face 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.040
 an opening position the move to which 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.010
 touch black and see what n regia in 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.280
 considerable development delay indeed the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.320
 renon is perched all these pieces of the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.860
 woman's side I'm at home while the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.720
 white to lie developed horse 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.309
 also faith dark field and ready to 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.430
 take action if necessary against 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.500
 the black castling also black 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.110
 also the woman at 100 checkerboard that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.290
 surely can be harassed for 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.570
 earn any other time then 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.720
 what he does then decides to try 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.729
 change the good bishop of the white la 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.250
 faith campochiaro that you see very active 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.539
 on light houses in a building from 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.560
 part of their pedestrians for their own e 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.000
 then play bishop at 6 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.619
 the idea quite good because now 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.619
 this bishop can hardly 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.330
 avoid the change since it is on the same 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.540
 tower line so if from fesr yes 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 moves without having changed the black 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 good in quality by capturing the tower 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.299
 ok but black has forgotten some 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.090
 problem in fact now the move is up to 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.500
 white let's see if you can find the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 winning move 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.990
 also pause and good luck 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.619
 how well you will have been able to give an account 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.120
 alone this will hardly be one 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.239
 position in that white can go 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.660
 beloved forced also because he can 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.569
 eventually escape on the back 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.069
 the appropriate king is no problem 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.440
 then the dealer gains material 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.040
 this combination and must exploit the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.019
 elements of the tactics of the attack 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.209
 double pressed the white with a piece 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.910
 will attack two pieces of the opponent in 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.630
 these cases hardly the opponent 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.819
 he can defend them both then he must 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.829
 exploit the position of the opposing king 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:49.340
 which is very exposed and finally the switch 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.810
 off that is an intermediate move that the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.810
 black does not wait 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.450
 ok let's see the thing first 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 which must immediately catch the eye 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.340
 just the fact that the black king is himself 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.829
 exposed as shown is exposed because 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:14.120
 still in the center and above all on this 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.920
 diagonal and what it entails at all 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.590
 be on these diagonal than white 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.660
 can attack 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 when he wants the idea with the woman 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.780
 that will spring to everyone and play 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.790
 immediately 4-check woman because this is it 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.550
 a double-barreled attack with weak real 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.170
 that looks like the fed will have to 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.260
 the next move happen because 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:44.049
 I defend only from the horse nothing more 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.849
 wrong indeed here bianchin and raba le 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.730
 options including probably the most 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.190
 papabile is playing woman there you are 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.079
 so he goes to threaten the woman on 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.819
 white has no time to capture 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:02.560
 the bishop because otherwise he loses the 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.920
 woman obviously here if she changes women 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.019
 and the enel shell for double-tagged 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 in any case another fast variant 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.680
 could also always be that of 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 to play 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.430
 b5 interposes the pawn on the check and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.019
 it also closes this line of attack here 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.729
 however white at least earns a pedestrian 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.740
 in short, it is going to be quite better ok 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.789
 however this year in the right move 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.789
 there is a better one 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:39.169
 and the best move is somehow 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.490
 Eliminate a defender from this bishop 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.620
 that is to actually capture from 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.930
 fairs maybe you were n't in black 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.210
 waited for this move that of white of 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.940
 own initiative was going to change the 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.490
 fair is good to leave bad of 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:00.449
 black then obviously will have to resume 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 an intermediate move you can play now 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:08.039
 actually woman 4 works because 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.090
 here if the pedestrian is pushed down the 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.550
 horse that is no longer defended because it is 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.919
 it was the bishop before he came 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.270
 caught and now the horse once that 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.270
 has captured in the most defended by anyone 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.340
 moreover if another way as I had 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.050
 seen before fending the check with don 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.800
 hashisc and obviously it doesn't work because 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.419
 it does not defend the horse and therefore the white 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.909
 can catch the horse anyway 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.639
 so for example the other horse move 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:41.699
 a cisse that the check seems to me not e 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.650
 however it will be possible to open the door anyway 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.659
 material 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.509
 ok this problem was not 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.699
 very difficult in my opinion I hope you are there 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:53.310
 managed to solve it 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.570
 in any case see you at the next a 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.570
 soon and bye bye
