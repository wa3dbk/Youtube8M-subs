00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.620 
be able to compete with that in its USB
connectivity<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
connectivity because you know this is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.130 
connectivity because you know this is
USB<00:00:27.869> 2.0<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:29.310> USB<00:00:29.730> 3.0<00:00:30.689> which<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
USB 2.0 and that's USB 3.0 which is you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.340 
USB 2.0 and that's USB 3.0 which is you
know<00:00:31.260> much<00:00:31.529> quicker<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.189> yeah<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.809> USB

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
know much quicker but yeah these USB

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.310 
know much quicker but yeah these USB

ports II the Nintendo doesn't recommend

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.600 
ports II the Nintendo doesn't recommend
it<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.520> plug<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.030> simple

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
it but you can you can plug in simple

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.150 
it but you can you can plug in simple
memory<00:00:41.610> stick<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.530> up<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.860> two

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
memory stick like this or up to two

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.200 
memory stick like this or up to two
terabytes<00:00:44.510> only<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:46.489> hard<00:00:47.489> disk<00:00:47.760> drive<00:00:47.969> size

terabytes only of hard disk drive size

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.740 
terabytes only of hard disk drive size
yeah

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
yeah

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.889 
yeah
Linton<00:00:49.379> recommends<00:00:49.829> hard<00:00:50.010> disk<00:00:50.250> drive<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
Linton recommends hard disk drive and

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.970 
Linton recommends hard disk drive and
currently<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.379> only<00:00:52.590> recognize<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.980> as

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
currently it can only recognize up to as

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
currently it can only recognize up to as
much<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:57.030> terabytes<00:00:57.570> any<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.350> than<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
much as two terabytes any more than that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
much as two terabytes any more than that
the<00:00:59.100> console<00:00:59.520> won't<00:00:59.820> recognize<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the console won't recognize it and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.689 
the console won't recognize it and
they're<00:01:01.350> planning<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> December<00:01:02.370> system

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
they're planning on a December system

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
they're planning on a December system
update<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.840> fix<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.769> look<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
update to fix that so look out for that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
update to fix that so look out for that
but<00:01:05.549> still<00:01:05.760> after<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> it'll<00:01:07.080> only<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.500> able

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
but still after that it'll only be able

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
but still after that it'll only be able
to<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.159> two<00:01:08.670> terabytes<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
to use up two terabytes of that and the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
to use up two terabytes of that and the
remaining<00:01:10.049> terabytes<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
remaining terabytes like you got a I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
remaining terabytes like you got a I
don't<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.330> 3<00:01:12.600> terabyte<00:01:12.990> hard<00:01:13.140> drive<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
don't know 3 terabyte hard drive it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.090 
don't know 3 terabyte hard drive it
won't<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.520> able<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.570> use<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
won't be able to use up use the one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
won't be able to use up use the one
remaining<00:01:17.490> terabyte<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
remaining terabyte but that's not what

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.999 
remaining terabyte but that's not what
I'm<00:01:19.530> gonna<00:01:19.770> talk<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> the

problem here is is well actually

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.539 
problem here is is well actually
plugging<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.509> US<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:28.439> themselves<00:01:29.070> they

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
plugging in the US be themselves they

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.630 
plugging in the US be themselves they
are<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.360> hard<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.710> I'll<00:01:32.250> try<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
are so hard to do like here I'll try to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.160 
are so hard to do like here I'll try to
plug<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.270> mean<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.540> mean<00:01:33.689> soon<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.049> know

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
plug this in I mean I mean soon you know

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.969 
plug this in I mean I mean soon you know
this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> USB<00:01:34.950> 3.0<00:01:35.700> plug<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> USB<00:01:37.079> 3.0

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this is a USB 3.0 plug this is a USB 3.0

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is a USB 3.0 plug this is a USB 3.0
port<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.369> know

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
port you know

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
port you know
simple<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.659> both<00:01:39.840> plug<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
simple they can both plug into them so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.399 
simple they can both plug into them so
you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.430> fine<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.049> problem

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you know that's fine but the problem

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.380 
you know that's fine but the problem
actually<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.220> plugging<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.090> konk

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
actually is in plugging in the konk

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
actually is in plugging in the konk
plugging<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.200> itself<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.860> mean<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
plugging it in itself I mean it's so

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
plugging it in itself I mean it's so
it's<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.000> hard<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:49.140> mean<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.590> watch

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it's so hard to do I mean just watch
