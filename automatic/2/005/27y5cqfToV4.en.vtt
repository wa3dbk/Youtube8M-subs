00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.729 
portrayed him on screen he looked good
and<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.360> looks<00:02:52.599> exactly<00:02:52.750> how<00:02:53.110> he<00:02:53.230> looked<00:02:53.590> on

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
of actually little holsters it's just

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
of actually little holsters it's just
pegs<00:03:01.719> on<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:01.989> side<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.499> the<00:03:02.530> gun

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
pegs on the side for the gun

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.100 
pegs on the side for the gun
