randomly Eddie's and stick them onto our

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.010 
randomly Eddie's and stick them onto our
cover-ups<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:59.300> got<00:00:59.450> to<00:00:59.540> cover<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.840> whole

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
cover-ups you got to cover the whole

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.410 
cover-ups you got to cover the whole
thing<00:01:01.420> all<00:01:03.339> have<00:01:04.339> bits<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.820> pieces<00:01:05.210> all<00:01:05.390> over

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
thing all have bits and pieces all over

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.900 
thing all have bits and pieces all over
it<00:01:05.780> or<00:01:06.680> not<00:01:07.120> overlap<00:01:08.120> like<00:01:08.690> so<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
it or not overlap like so and so and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.120 
it or not overlap like so and so and
then<00:01:11.510> we'll<00:01:11.630> have<00:01:11.780> some<00:01:12.020> nice<00:01:12.229> straight<00:01:12.680> edges

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
then we'll have some nice straight edges

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.200 
then we'll have some nice straight edges
that<00:01:13.640> will<00:01:13.820> go<00:01:14.680> along<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.950> very<00:01:16.220> edge<00:01:16.550> all<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
that will go along the very edge all the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.790 
that will go along the very edge all the
way<00:01:17.240> around<00:01:17.540> i<00:01:17.900> don't<00:01:17.930> think<00:01:18.320> i'll<00:01:18.470> do<00:01:18.650> the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
way around i don't think i'll do the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.620 
way around i don't think i'll do the
inside<00:01:19.250> i<00:01:19.280> think<00:01:19.430> i'll<00:01:19.729> just<00:01:19.940> do<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.210> outside

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
inside i think i'll just do the outside

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.780 
inside i think i'll just do the outside
so<00:01:21.229> i'm<00:01:21.410> going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.619> do<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.580> I'll<00:01:22.670> be

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
so i'm going to do that and then I'll be

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.969 
so i'm going to do that and then I'll be
right<00:01:22.970> back<00:01:23.150> up<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:23.960> now<00:01:24.229> we've<00:01:24.560> done<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.770> nice

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
right back up so now we've done a nice

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.120 
right back up so now we've done a nice
layer<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.780> masking<00:01:26.780> tape<00:01:27.020> on<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.830> front<00:01:28.070> cover

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
layer of masking tape on the front cover

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.520 
layer of masking tape on the front cover
I'm<00:01:29.060> going<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.330> go<00:01:29.390> all<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.600> way<00:01:29.630> around<00:01:29.780> so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm going to go all the way around so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.889 
I'm going to go all the way around so
there's<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.100> score<00:01:31.430> mark<00:01:31.670> just<00:01:32.119> in<00:01:32.330> here<00:01:32.600> I've

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
there's a score mark just in here I've

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.020 
there's a score mark just in here I've
come<00:01:33.170> close<00:01:33.200> right<00:01:34.070> up<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.399> edge<00:01:34.729> there

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
come close right up to that edge there

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.210 
come close right up to that edge there
but<00:01:35.509> now<00:01:35.630> i'm<00:01:35.720> going<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.930> go<00:01:36.020> over<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.649> i'm

continue<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.780> masking<00:01:42.140> tape<00:01:42.670> along<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
continue the masking tape along that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.870 
continue the masking tape along that
area<00:01:44.420> as<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:45.200> okay<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.399> then<00:01:46.640> we're<00:01:46.759> going

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.190 
area as well okay and then we're going
to<00:01:46.940> come<00:01:47.000> through<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.479> scroll<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.930> line

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
to come through it and scroll that line

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.650 
to come through it and scroll that line
in<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.530> minute<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.340> i'll<00:01:49.430> continue<00:01:49.759> on<00:01:50.119> we've

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
got it one nice line here i think i'm

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.469 
got it one nice line here i think i'm
going<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.280> add<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.460> little<00:01:52.670> bit<00:01:52.850> more<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.390> want

that<00:01:55.250> none<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.940> little<00:01:56.179> torn<00:01:56.780> bits<00:01:57.080> are

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
that none of the little torn bits are

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.109 
that none of the little torn bits are
sticking<00:01:57.590> up<00:01:57.709> and<00:01:58.009> just<00:01:58.429> continue<00:01:58.880> along
