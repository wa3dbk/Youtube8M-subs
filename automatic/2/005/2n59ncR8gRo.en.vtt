like to do the very first thing is I
talked<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> guitarist<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:13.139> asked<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
talked to the guitarist and I asked the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.890 
talked to the guitarist and I asked the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
guitars if there is a sweet spot on his

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.410 
guitars if there is a sweet spot on his
amplifier<00:00:16.730> because<00:00:17.730> usually<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.150> there's<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
amplifier because usually if there's a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.000 
amplifier because usually if there's a
sweet<00:00:18.630> spot<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.990> guitarist<00:00:19.380> knows<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
sweet spot the guitarist knows about it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
sweet spot the guitarist knows about it
sometimes<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> guitars<00:00:21.240> might<00:00:21.420> even<00:00:21.599> have<00:00:21.779> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
sometimes the guitars might even have a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.950 
sometimes the guitars might even have a
piece<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> tape<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:23.369> his<00:00:23.760> amp<00:00:24.029> grill<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
piece of tape on his amp grill that

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900 
piece of tape on his amp grill that
indicates<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.619> sweet<00:00:26.009> spot<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.609> and

when I say sweet spot I mean the best
sounding<00:00:29.099> spot<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> amplifier<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.839> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
sounding spot of the amplifier or the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
sounding spot of the amplifier or the
the<00:00:31.259> cabinet<00:00:31.710> now<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.820> amp<00:00:33.060> this<00:00:33.420> guitar<00:00:33.750> cab

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the cabinet now this amp this guitar cab

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
the cabinet now this amp this guitar cab
doesn't<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.500> any<00:00:35.160> indication<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.510> the

doesn't have any indication and the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
doesn't have any indication and the
guitar<00:00:36.870> doesn't<00:00:37.379> quite<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
guitar doesn't quite know where the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.180 
guitar doesn't quite know where the
sweet<00:00:38.460> spot<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
sweet spot is so what I'm going to do is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
sweet spot is so what I'm going to do is
follow<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.940> couple<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> general<00:00:42.780> rules<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.320> get

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
follow a couple of general rules to get

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.360 
follow a couple of general rules to get
good<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:44.070> guitar<00:00:44.430> tone<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:46.559> actual<00:00:46.920> speaker

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
good good guitar tone the actual speaker

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.310 
good good guitar tone the actual speaker
behind<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> grille<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.539> made<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.199> a

the cone and then the outer rim which is
called<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> surround<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> speaker<00:00:56.280> now

called the surround of the speaker now

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
called the surround of the speaker now
the<00:00:56.940> center<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.050> speaker<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.410> dust<00:00:58.739> cap

the center of the speaker the dust cap

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.110 
the center of the speaker the dust cap
tends<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.850> sound<00:01:00.629> real<00:01:01.019> harsh<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.649> real<00:01:02.120> brass

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
tends to sound real harsh and real brass

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
tends to sound real harsh and real brass
real<00:01:03.449> high<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.809> frequencies<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.410> lot<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
real high in frequencies a lot of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
real high in frequencies a lot of
high-end<00:01:04.830> energy<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.370> on<00:01:05.550> there<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:07.170> more

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
high-end energy going on there the more

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100 
high-end energy going on there the more
towards<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.160> surround<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.540> outer<00:01:09.720> rim<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
towards the surround the outer rim of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160 
towards the surround the outer rim of
the<00:01:10.200> speaker<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:11.460> bassy<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.720> sound<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the speaker the more bassy the sound is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
the speaker the more bassy the sound is
so<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.670> take<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so what I like to do is take the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
so what I like to do is take the
microphone<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:16.259> using<00:01:16.500> dynamic

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
microphone and I'm using dynamic

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.740 
microphone and I'm using dynamic
microphones<00:01:17.729> again<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.270> they<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> take

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
microphones again because they can take

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990 
microphones again because they can take
that<00:01:19.020> high<00:01:19.290> sound<00:01:19.740> pressure<00:01:19.860> level<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.880> are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that high sound pressure level these are

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.260 
that high sound pressure level these are
shure<00:01:21.329> sm57<00:01:22.340> i'm<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.579> place<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
shure sm57 i'm going to place the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620 
shure sm57 i'm going to place the
microphone<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.960> shure<00:01:25.140> sm57<00:01:26.329> between<00:01:27.329> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
microphone the shure sm57 between the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
microphone the shure sm57 between the
dust<00:01:27.900> cap<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> harsh<00:01:28.920> sound<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
dust cap which is the harsh sound and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.740 
dust cap which is the harsh sound and
the<00:01:30.000> surround<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.159> nice<00:01:32.700> even<00:01:32.970> mix

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the surround to get a nice even mix

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
the surround to get a nice even mix
between<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> harshness<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.939> bass

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
between the harshness and the the bass

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.499 
between the harshness and the the bass
enos<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> speak<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> one

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
enos so to speak so when I got that one

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
enos so to speak so when I got that one
in<00:01:39.600> place<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.140> also<00:01:40.320> gonna<00:01:40.590> do<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.280> since
