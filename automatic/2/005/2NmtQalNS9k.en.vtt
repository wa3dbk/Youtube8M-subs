00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.200 

then<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.619> create<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.130> leaves<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.729> flowers

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
then to create the leaves to the flowers

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.419 
then to create the leaves to the flowers
using<00:01:50.509> my<00:01:50.750> green<00:01:51.020> polish<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.649> just<00:01:51.979> use<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
using my green polish I just use the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.020 
using my green polish I just use the
brush<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.030> kind<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.569> made<00:01:54.319> a<00:01:54.590> leaf<00:01:55.549> looking

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
brush and kind of made a leaf looking

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.139 
brush and kind of made a leaf looking
shapes<00:01:56.390> using<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:57.170> tip<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.060> way

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
shapes using the tip and I like the way

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.510 
shapes using the tip and I like the way
that<00:01:59.329> they're<00:01:59.600> not<00:01:59.780> perfect<00:02:00.319> and<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:01.189> just

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
that they're not perfect and it just

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.149 
that they're not perfect and it just
adds<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.270> whole<00:02:02.299> look<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.709> could<00:02:04.009> use

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
adds to the whole look so you could use

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.529 
adds to the whole look so you could use
a<00:02:04.189> dotting<00:02:04.459> tool<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.880> make<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.149> leaves<00:02:05.299> but<00:02:05.479> I

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
a dotting tool to make the leaves but I

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.819 
a dotting tool to make the leaves but I
just<00:02:05.810> use<00:02:05.959> brush<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.439> I<00:02:06.469> thought<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.799> looked

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
just use brush and I thought it looked

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.609 
just use brush and I thought it looked
cool<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.459> then<00:02:07.819> finally<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.269> added<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.959> silver

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
cool and then finally I added a silver

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.350 
cool and then finally I added a silver
glitter<00:02:09.950> polish<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.789> center<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.180> each

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720 
glitter polish to the center of each
flower<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.470> finished<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.980> off<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.549> i

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
flower and that finished it off so i

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.330 
flower and that finished it off so i
used<00:02:14.329> a<00:02:14.599> fast<00:02:14.989> drying<00:02:15.230> top<00:02:15.319> coat<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.769> seal<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
used a fast drying top coat to seal it
