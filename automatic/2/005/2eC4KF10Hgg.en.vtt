we're probably best known for we make
Grenache<00:03:53.700> which<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:55.160> well<00:03:56.160> which<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.000> sort<00:03:57.240> of

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
Grenache which is well which is sort of

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.270 
Grenache which is well which is sort of
my<00:03:58.970> it's<00:03:59.970> my<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.870> love<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.560> some<00:04:01.830> ways<00:04:02.010> although

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
my it's my my love in some ways although

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.950 
my it's my my love in some ways although
I<00:04:02.400> love<00:04:02.670> Syrah<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.060> all<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> other<00:04:03.480> varieties

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
I love Syrah and all the other varieties

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.230 
I love Syrah and all the other varieties
but<00:04:04.590> Grenache<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.280> sort<00:04:05.460> of<00:04:05.490> a<00:04:05.610> maddening

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
but Grenache is sort of a maddening

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.880 
but Grenache is sort of a maddening
variety<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:07.020> is<00:04:07.140> very<00:04:07.260> difficult<00:04:07.740> to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
variety and that it is very difficult to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.800 
variety and that it is very difficult to
grow<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.340> difficult<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.820> make<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.240> therefore

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
grow and difficult to make and therefore

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.520 
grow and difficult to make and therefore
I<00:04:10.760> sort<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.820> particularly<00:04:12.810> prone<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
I sort of particularly prone to it

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.090 
I sort of particularly prone to it
because<00:04:13.860> unlike<00:04:14.160> its<00:04:14.370> stubbornness<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:16.470> then

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
because unlike its stubbornness and then

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.460 
because unlike its stubbornness and then
we<00:04:17.250> make<00:04:17.400> also<00:04:17.730> some<00:04:17.959> some<00:04:18.959> dessert<00:04:19.260> wines

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
we make also some some dessert wines

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.460 
we make also some some dessert wines

then press sort of like in a raisin
State<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:55.630> make<00:04:55.930> another<00:04:56.290> wine<00:04:56.560> that's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
State we make another wine that's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.360 
State we make another wine that's
Petridis<00:04:58.060> wine<00:04:58.600> but<00:04:58.960> why<00:04:59.110> racism<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.130> it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
Petridis wine but why racism so it's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.700 
Petridis wine but why racism so it's
also<00:05:00.610> known<00:05:00.910> as<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.180> noble<00:05:01.540> rot<00:05:01.780> which<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.680> a

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
also known as the noble rot which is a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.680 
also known as the noble rot which is a
fungus<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.310> attacks<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.880> grapes<00:05:04.120> and

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
fungus that attacks the grapes and

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.390 
fungus that attacks the grapes and
essentially<00:05:05.200> punctures<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.860> skins<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
essentially punctures the skins and

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.370 
essentially punctures the skins and
thereby<00:05:06.670> concentrates<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.420> fruit<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:07.930> in

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
thereby concentrates the fruit and in

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.730 
thereby concentrates the fruit and in
parts<00:05:08.710> of<00:05:08.800> flavor<00:05:09.040> as<00:05:09.220> well<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.730> rather

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
parts of flavor as well and rather

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.580 
parts of flavor as well and rather
interesting<00:05:12.420> process<00:05:13.420> that<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.170> course<00:05:14.380> we

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
interesting process that of course we

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.290 
interesting process that of course we
have<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.920> help<00:05:15.070> nature<00:05:15.340> along<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.030> in

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
have to help nature along and this in

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.870 
have to help nature along and this in
this<00:05:16.450> climate<00:05:17.040> but<00:05:18.040> we<00:05:18.130> make<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.790> we've

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
this climate but we make that and we've

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.690 
this climate but we make that and we've
also<00:05:19.060> made<00:05:19.270> some<00:05:19.450> iced<00:05:19.570> wine<00:05:19.780> which<00:05:20.470> is<00:05:20.700> very

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
also made some iced wine which is very

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.910 
also made some iced wine which is very
unusual<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.750> shocking<00:05:23.290> to<00:05:23.410> some<00:05:23.590> people<00:05:23.890> that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
unusual and shocking to some people that

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.410 
unusual and shocking to some people that
we<00:05:24.160> couldn't<00:05:24.400> make<00:05:24.460> iced<00:05:24.700> wine<00:05:24.940> in<00:05:25.090> in

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
we couldn't make iced wine in in

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.980 
we couldn't make iced wine in in
California<00:05:26.140> but<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:28.150> have<00:05:28.360> and<00:05:28.660> we<00:05:28.750> have<00:05:28.840> done

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
California but we have and we have done

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.150 
California but we have and we have done
it<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.170> a<00:05:29.230> number<00:05:29.410> of<00:05:29.440> years<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.830> we've<00:05:29.950> done

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
it for a number of years and we've done

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.390 
it for a number of years and we've done
it<00:05:30.250> with<00:05:30.370> arrest<00:05:30.820> Romina<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.210> viene<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.950> it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
it with arrest Romina and viene and it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.680 
it with arrest Romina and viene and it
works<00:05:33.580> actually<00:05:33.880> quite<00:05:34.060> well<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.330> course<00:05:34.570> we

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
works actually quite well of course we

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.330 
works actually quite well of course we
have<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.020> we<00:05:35.470> have<00:05:35.500> to<00:05:35.650> freeze<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.130> grapes

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
have to we have to freeze the grapes

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.970 
have to we have to freeze the grapes
because<00:05:37.330> we<00:05:37.690> don't<00:05:37.870> get<00:05:38.110> frost<00:05:38.380> in<00:05:38.620> there

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
because we don't get frost in there

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.800 
because we don't get frost in there
although<00:05:39.370> last<00:05:39.640> year<00:05:39.880> we<00:05:40.000> did<00:05:40.920> and<00:05:42.060> but<00:05:43.060> my

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
although last year we did and but my

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.930 
although last year we did and but my
usual<00:05:44.200> line<00:05:44.710> is<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:46.590> think<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.940> grapes

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
usual line is that I think that grapes

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.820 
usual line is that I think that grapes
don't<00:05:49.180> knowwho<00:05:49.450> frozen<00:05:50.020> whether<00:05:50.230> it<00:05:50.380> was<00:05:50.560> God

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
don't knowwho frozen whether it was God

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.770 
don't knowwho frozen whether it was God
or<00:05:50.860> Manfred<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:52.210> so<00:05:52.540> cold<00:05:53.350> is<00:05:53.560> cold<00:05:53.830> and<00:05:54.070> and

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
or Manfred and so cold is cold and and

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.820 
or Manfred and so cold is cold and and
the<00:05:55.780> rest<00:05:55.960> of<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.140> process<00:05:56.320> is<00:05:56.620> really

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
the rest of the process is really

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.920 
the rest of the process is really
essentially<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.310> same<00:05:57.490> we<00:05:58.390> simply<00:05:58.720> freeze

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
essentially the same we simply freeze

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.060 
essentially the same we simply freeze
them<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.170> then<00:05:59.320> press<00:05:59.560> them<00:05:59.710> in<00:05:59.800> its<00:05:59.920> frozen

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
them and then press them in its frozen

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.770 
them and then press them in its frozen
state<00:06:00.430> and<00:06:00.640> and<00:06:00.850> so<00:06:01.090> we've<00:06:01.210> made<00:06:01.240> some<00:06:01.390> iseman

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
state and and so we've made some iseman

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.290 
state and and so we've made some iseman
as<00:06:01.870> well<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.620> that's<00:06:02.800> been<00:06:03.130> certainly<00:06:03.670> a

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
as well and that's been certainly a

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.150 
as well and that's been certainly a
labor<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:04.990> love<00:06:05.110> about<00:06:05.560> an<00:06:05.650> interesting

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
labor of love about an interesting

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.060 
labor of love about an interesting
really<00:06:06.880> interesting<00:06:06.970> experience<00:06:07.810> for<00:06:07.870> us<00:06:08.070> to

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
really interesting experience for us to

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.770
