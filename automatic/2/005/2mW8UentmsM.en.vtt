pleased that you took part in the
decathlon<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> might<00:01:00.899> have

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
decathlon or do you think you might have

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.380 
decathlon or do you think you might have
been<00:01:01.440> better<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.120> could<00:01:03.270> have

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
been better or you know you could have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
been better or you know you could have
had<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> longer<00:01:04.110> career<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.979> different

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
had a longer career in a different

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
had a longer career in a different
discipline<00:01:05.729> um<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.010> been

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
discipline um I think it would have been

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
discipline um I think it would have been
obviously<00:01:08.700> easier<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.810> been<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> hundred

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
obviously easier to have been a hundred

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
obviously easier to have been a hundred
meter<00:01:10.470> runner<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.250> long<00:01:11.460> jumper<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
meter runner or a long jumper but I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.429 
meter runner or a long jumper but I
wouldn't<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> been<00:01:12.540> able<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> best

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
wouldn't have been able to be the best

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.359 
wouldn't have been able to be the best
and<00:01:14.180> for<00:01:15.180> me<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.720> didn't<00:01:16.200> care<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:16.619> I'd

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.260 
defeats but I think that's been a good
thing<00:06:38.000> in<00:06:38.600> its<00:06:38.990> in<00:06:39.680> that<00:06:39.919> now<00:06:40.070> she<00:06:40.130> knows<00:06:40.460> what
