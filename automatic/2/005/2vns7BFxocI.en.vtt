about ten years experience in the
construction<00:00:04.470> field<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.490> we're<00:00:06.000> laying<00:00:06.180> out

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
construction field and we're laying out

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.310 
construction field and we're laying out
a<00:00:07.130> diagonal<00:00:08.130> countertop<00:00:08.940> today<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:10.230> have

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
a diagonal countertop today we have

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.990 
a diagonal countertop today we have
about<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> same<00:00:10.800> space<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.820> same

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
about the same space about the same

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.940 
about the same space about the same
spacing<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.630> both<00:00:12.809> sides<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.259> scene<00:00:13.469> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
spacing on both sides of the scene and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.580 
spacing on both sides of the scene and
we're<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> start<00:00:15.269> from<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.590> since

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we're going to start from here since

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.019 
we're going to start from here since
this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.190> point<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> see

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this is the first point that you see

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.929 
this is the first point that you see
when<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.480> come<00:00:18.510> around<00:00:18.810> around<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> corner

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
when you come around around the corner

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
when you come around around the corner
you<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.150> want<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> Center<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> tile<00:00:22.430> you

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
you just want to Center this tile you

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.839 
you just want to Center this tile you
can<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.119> two<00:00:24.150> ways<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.630> usually<00:00:24.960> just

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
can do it one or two ways I usually just

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
can do it one or two ways I usually just
estimate<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.840> amount<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.830> measure<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
estimate the amount and then measure to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
estimate the amount and then measure to
see<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.880> right<00:00:29.970> here<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.140> 3<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
see if I have it right here it's 3 and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.150 
see if I have it right here it's 3 and
3/4<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.809> almost<00:00:33.809> 3/4<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.829> speed<00:00:34.980> back

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
3/4 and almost 3/4 so just speed back

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.340 
3/4 and almost 3/4 so just speed back
this<00:00:35.280> way<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> does<00:00:35.760> not<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.360> exact

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.979 

or<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.800> little<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:41.700> than<00:00:41.910> four<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> screwed

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
or a little more than four you screwed

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
or a little more than four you screwed
it<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:43.469> bit<00:00:43.910> what<00:00:44.910> we're

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it that way a little bit what we're

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
it that way a little bit what we're
gonna<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> find<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
gonna do is we're going to find the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
gonna do is we're going to find the
center<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:48.690> countertop<00:00:49.200> after<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.680> kind

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
center of the countertop after we kind

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.090 
center of the countertop after we kind
of<00:00:50.160> Center<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> tile<00:00:51.649> find<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> center<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of Center the tile find the center of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.430 
of Center the tile find the center of
the<00:00:53.160> countertop

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.540 

so<00:00:59.070> about<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> quarter<00:01:01.130> this<00:01:02.130> is<00:01:02.190> spot

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so about one and a quarter this is spot

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.830 
so about one and a quarter this is spot
right<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.150> be<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.420> center<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
right here would be the center of the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
right here would be the center of the
countertop<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.720> want<00:01:06.870> to<00:01:06.960> measure<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
countertop now just want to measure the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.910 
countertop now just want to measure the
tile<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.160> have<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> almost<00:01:08.910> right

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
tile and see if we have it almost right

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.840 
tile and see if we have it almost right
sixteen<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> half<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> it'd<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.580> eight<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
sixteen and a half so it'd be eight and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.540 
sixteen and a half so it'd be eight and
a<00:01:11.880> quarter<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:13.410> about<00:01:13.620> right

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.460 

and<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.119> sixteen<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> half<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and it should be sixteen and a half so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850 
and it should be sixteen and a half so
eight<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.190> quarter<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.530> need<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> move<00:01:22.740> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
eight and a quarter so I need to move it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.120 
eight and a quarter so I need to move it
over<00:01:23.090> but<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.410> there<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.030> take<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
over but right there you just take and

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
over but right there you just take and
split<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.119> difference<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.660> the<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.899> lines

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
split the difference of the two lines

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.910 
split the difference of the two lines
and<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.130> center<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.770> wanna<00:01:34.770> make

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and that's your center so you wanna make

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.300 
and that's your center so you wanna make
sure<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.330> get<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
sure that this is all we can get it a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
sure that this is all we can get it a
square<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.820> lay<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.080> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
square and lay it out or you can get it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
square and lay it out or you can get it
for<00:01:40.380> forty-five<00:01:41.160> degree<00:01:41.460> angle<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.270> can

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
for forty-five degree angle or you can

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
for forty-five degree angle or you can
do<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.660> by<00:01:43.080> just<00:01:43.110> sight<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> by

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
do it by just sight I like to do it by

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
do it by just sight I like to do it by
sight<00:01:44.940> because<00:01:45.240> none<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.690> these<00:01:45.810> counters<00:01:46.259> of

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
sight because none of these counters of

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
sight because none of these counters of
the<00:01:46.500> or<00:01:47.300> square<00:01:48.300> or<00:01:48.330> anything<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.910> get<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the or square or anything and you get it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.499 
the or square or anything and you get it
to<00:01:51.210> where<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.110> about<00:01:52.350> right

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
to where you it looks just about right

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.120 
to where you it looks just about right
grab<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.660> some<00:01:54.869> spacers<00:01:55.470> cuz<00:01:55.830> you're<00:01:55.950> going

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
grab you some spacers cuz you're going

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
grab you some spacers cuz you're going
to<00:01:56.250> lay<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.970> first<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:58.170> will

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
to lay all this out first which will

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
to lay all this out first which will
take<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> while<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.789> one<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
take it will take a while that one in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
take it will take a while that one in
the<00:02:00.300> back<00:02:00.509> took<00:02:00.840> probably<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.560> full<00:02:01.979> day<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the back took probably a full day of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.930 
the back took probably a full day of

just laying out tile cutting it I know

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.160 
just laying out tile cutting it I know
how<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.209> make<00:02:06.390> numerous<00:02:06.720> cuts<00:02:07.110> over<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.560> over

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
how to make numerous cuts over and over

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.860 
how to make numerous cuts over and over
okay<00:02:10.170> lay<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> spacers<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:12.750> you're

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
okay lay out the spacers now you're

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.790 
okay lay out the spacers now you're
gonna<00:02:12.959> use<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.910> pre<00:02:14.910> chosen<00:02:15.510> color<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.530> here

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
gonna use a pre chosen color back here

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.790 
gonna use a pre chosen color back here
we<00:02:16.920> use<00:02:17.099> black<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:19.319> gonna<00:02:19.380> use<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
we use black up here we're gonna use the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.199 
we use black up here we're gonna use the
same<00:02:19.830> color<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.580> used<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.090> front

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
same color that we used at the front

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.030 
same color that we used at the front
door<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:23.750> lay<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.380> where<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> spacers

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
door and lay it in to where the spacers

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.230 
door and lay it in to where the spacers
are

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.470 

you<00:02:30.240> have<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.510> hold<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.910> put<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.060> pattern

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
you have to hold it put this pattern

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.199 
you have to hold it put this pattern
over<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.380> can<00:02:34.560> kind<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:36.000> what

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
over it so that you can kind of see what

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.790 
over it so that you can kind of see what
you're<00:02:36.330> going<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.630> here<00:02:36.870> you're<00:02:37.470> gonna<00:02:37.650> have

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you're going for here you're gonna have

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.080 
you're going for here you're gonna have
this<00:02:37.980> border<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.540> top<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:44.090> just

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
this border around the top so you just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.809 
this border around the top so you just
measure<00:02:45.450> which<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.709> what<00:02:46.890> 16<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.790> a

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
measure which this is what 16 and a

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:56.479 
measure which this is what 16 and a
quarter<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.110> 12<00:02:56.040> inch<00:02:56.130> tile

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
quarter and then this is a 12 inch tile

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.710 
quarter and then this is a 12 inch tile
it's<00:02:56.970> 11<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.660> 3/4<00:02:58.260> tile<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.480> kind<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> odd

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's 11 and 3/4 tile this is kind of odd

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.110 
it's 11 and 3/4 tile this is kind of odd
but<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.160> two<00:03:05.610> quarter<00:03:06.090> inch

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
but and then you have two quarter inch

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.850 
but and then you have two quarter inch
spacers<00:03:06.690> which<00:03:07.049> you're<00:03:07.230> gonna<00:03:07.290> take<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.620> half

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
spacers which you're gonna take a half

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.500 
spacers which you're gonna take a half
inch<00:03:08.069> off<00:03:08.250> from<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.269> will<00:03:09.390> be

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
inch off from it and then that will be

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.140 
inch off from it and then that will be
the<00:03:09.630> size<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.989> tile<00:03:10.700> your<00:03:11.810> entire<00:03:14.150> large

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the size of your tile your entire large

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.380 
the size of your tile your entire large
piece<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.810> plastic<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.650> 16<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.209> quarter

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
piece of plastic is 16 and a quarter

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.570 
piece of plastic is 16 and a quarter
inches<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:19.769> tile<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.400> only<00:03:20.610> 11<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.560> 3/4<00:03:22.580> so

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
inches your tile is only 11 and 3/4 so

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.910 
inches your tile is only 11 and 3/4 so
that<00:03:26.569> then<00:03:27.569> from<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> 3/4<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.440> 16<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
that then from the 3/4 and 16 and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.330 
that then from the 3/4 and 16 and
quarter

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
quarter

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.390 
quarter
that<00:03:29.940> gives<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.510> difference<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.170> 3<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.560> 3<00:03:31.739> 3

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that gives you a difference of 3 and 3 3

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.560 
that gives you a difference of 3 and 3 3
4<00:03:32.940> 4<00:03:33.540> 2<00:03:33.750> quarter<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.760> can<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.090> count<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
4 4 2 quarter and you can just count the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.270 
4 4 2 quarter and you can just count the
little<00:03:36.690> spaces<00:03:37.049> if<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.500> need<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.799> or<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.250> a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
little spaces if you need to or have a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.280 
little spaces if you need to or have a
unique<00:03:38.670> however<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.540> need<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.049> so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
unique however you need to do it so

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.400 
unique however you need to do it so
that's<00:03:40.440> four<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.769> quarter<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:43.230> then

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
that's four and a quarter and then

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.199 
that's four and a quarter and then
you're<00:03:43.530> gonna<00:03:43.620> take<00:03:43.799> out<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.220> half<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.940> that's

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
you're gonna take out a half so that's

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:54.880 
you're gonna take out a half so that's
three<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.570> three<00:03:45.959> quarters

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.120 

so<00:03:55.460> that<00:03:55.610> would<00:03:55.730> be<00:03:55.820> 3<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.090> 3/4<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.130> that

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
so that would be 3 and 3/4 and that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.240 
so that would be 3 and 3/4 and that
would<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.670> set<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.470> width<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.860> tile

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.900 

or<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.430> width<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.440> empty<00:04:06.800> space<00:04:07.130> that's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
or the width of the empty space that's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.990 
or the width of the empty space that's
not<00:04:08.150> taken<00:04:08.690> up<00:04:08.750> by<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.050> tile<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.740> grout

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
not taken up by the tile and the grout

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.940 
not taken up by the tile and the grout
so<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.060> take<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.540> 3<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.960> 3/4<00:04:12.470> and<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.710> split

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
so you take that 3 and 3/4 and you split

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.250 
so you take that 3 and 3/4 and you split
it<00:04:13.070> into<00:04:13.190> two<00:04:13.520> so<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.240> you<00:04:14.390> have<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.810> border

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it into two so that you have a border

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.759 
it into two so that you have a border
all<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.410> way<00:04:15.500> around<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:18.320> that's<00:04:18.530> how<00:04:18.680> you

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
all the way around and that's how you

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.620 
all the way around and that's how you
would<00:04:19.070> lay<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.170> center<00:04:21.170> of<00:04:21.590> your

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
would lay out the center of your

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.410 
would lay out the center of your
diagonal<00:04:23.630> countertop
