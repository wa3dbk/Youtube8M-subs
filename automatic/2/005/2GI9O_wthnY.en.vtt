00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.890 
that I've taken the bars off at the
moment<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.450> thinking<00:01:15.840> about

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
moment because so I'm thinking about

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.469

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
now gloss black so hopefully that will

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.859 
now gloss black so hopefully that will
give<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.180> more<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.509> eye<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
give a little bit more of an eye of the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the moment thinking about putting a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.920 
the moment thinking about putting a
smaller<00:01:39.119> aftermarket<00:01:39.869> one<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:41.930> slowly

smaller aftermarket one there slowly

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.670 
smaller aftermarket one there slowly
taking<00:01:43.380> shape<00:01:45.110> taking<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> chrome<00:01:46.409> side

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
covers off the engine that guy over here
and<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.180> without

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and because I kind of like it without

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.139 
and because I kind of like it without
that<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> I've<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.890> made<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.310> my<00:01:53.460> made<00:01:54.000> up

some<00:01:54.360> smaller<00:01:55.460> bolts<00:01:56.509> with<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.780> chrome

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
some smaller bolts with little chrome

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.700 
some smaller bolts with little chrome
heads<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.820> couldn't<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.750> Claire

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
heads on I couldn't actually get Claire

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.889 
heads on I couldn't actually get Claire
couldn't<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.320> ones<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.469> wanted

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
couldn't actually get the ones I wanted

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
couldn't actually get the ones I wanted
with<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> chrome<00:02:07.320> head<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> sort<00:02:09.030> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
with the chrome head on it so I sort of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
with the chrome head on it so I sort of
bought<00:02:09.629> some<00:02:09.869> thread<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.379> lock<00:02:11.099> tight<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
bought some thread and lock tight and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.740 
bought some thread and lock tight and
made<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.420> my<00:02:12.540> own<00:02:12.629> bolts<00:02:13.020> so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
made up my own bolts so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.420 
made up my own bolts so
just<00:02:14.050> addresses<00:02:14.590> those<00:02:14.740> little<00:02:15.010> holes<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
just addresses those little holes up a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.700 
just addresses those little holes up a
bit<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:17.130> what<00:02:18.130> else<00:02:18.250> we're<00:02:18.520> done<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.170> put

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
bit and what else we're done okay put

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.250 
bit and what else we're done okay put
the<00:02:20.800> pod<00:02:21.100> filter<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.730> there<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.140> I'm

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the pod filter on there and I think I'm

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.870 
the pod filter on there and I think I'm
a<00:02:23.410> shown<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.920> last<00:02:24.190> time<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.560> we'll

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
a shown that last time and then we'll

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.530 
a shown that last time and then we'll
crank<00:02:27.880> case<00:02:28.060> breather<00:02:28.120> filter<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.240> all

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
crank case breather filter so that's all

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.400 
crank case breather filter so that's all
