rocket science but they might give you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.230 
rocket science but they might give you
some<00:00:16.550> options<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.180> know

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
some options out there because I know

that you find inside vitamins inside you
know<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.579> sneakers<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.629> find<00:00:39.840> these

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
know you get sneakers you find these

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.319 
know you get sneakers you find these
packs<00:00:40.489> electronic<00:00:41.489> boxes<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> find<00:00:42.180> these

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
packs electronic boxes you find these

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
packs electronic boxes you find these
packs<00:00:42.570> they're<00:00:42.750> everywhere<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> basically

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
packs they're everywhere and basically

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
packs they're everywhere and basically
what<00:00:44.640> silica<00:00:45.059> gel<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.440> inert

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
what silica gel is it's a an inert

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
what silica gel is it's a an inert
substance<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:48.210> absorbs<00:00:49.020> moisture<00:00:49.350> that's

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
substance that absorbs moisture that's

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.619 
substance that absorbs moisture that's
it's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.460> poor<00:00:50.670> substance<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> absorbs

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it's a very poor substance that absorbs

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's a very poor substance that absorbs
moisture<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.980> very<00:00:53.340> good<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:55.039> dry

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
moisture so it's very good for dry

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.299 
moisture so it's very good for dry
storage<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.730> anything<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> foods<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.170> well<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
storage of anything and foods as well so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
storage of anything and foods as well so
you<00:00:59.820> will<00:00:59.969> find<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:01.710> sorts<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you will find it in all sorts of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
you will find it in all sorts of
different<00:01:02.219> items<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.210> save<00:01:03.539> these<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.989> when

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
different items so save these up when

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
different items so save these up when
you<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.439> them<00:01:04.650> save<00:01:04.949> them<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.369> these<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you get them save them up these can

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
you get them save them up these can
actually<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.390> reused<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.650> absorb<00:01:07.830> up

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
actually be reused they will absorb up

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.870 
actually be reused they will absorb up
to<00:01:08.280> 40%<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.939> their<00:01:09.090> own<00:01:09.180> weight<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.630> moisture

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
to 40% of their own weight in moisture

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
to 40% of their own weight in moisture
so<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.330> them<00:01:12.510> collect<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.110> lay

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so when you get them collect them lay

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.770 
so when you get them collect them lay
them<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.950> cookie<00:01:14.040> sheet<00:01:14.549> pop<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.689> in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
them out on a cookie sheet pop them in

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
them out on a cookie sheet pop them in
your<00:01:15.810> oven<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.409> about<00:01:16.680> 220<00:01:17.460> degrees<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> low

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
your oven at about 220 degrees a low

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
your oven at about 220 degrees a low
heat<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:19.140> hours<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> will

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
heat for about two hours and that will

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.820 
heat for about two hours and that will
dry<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.030> reusable<00:01:21.830> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
dry them out and these are reusable so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
dry them out and these are reusable so
you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.189> reuse<00:01:23.430> these<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.119> overcook<00:01:24.570> them

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you can reuse these don't overcook them

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.310 
you can reuse these don't overcook them
and<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.689> number<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> use

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and so that's number one and you can use

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950 
and so that's number one and you can use
that<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.740> combination<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.090> already<00:01:33.509> at

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that in combination with some already at

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.620 
that in combination with some already at
hand<00:01:34.579> items<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> may<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> let's<00:01:36.420> say

hand items that you may have let's say

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
hand items that you may have let's say
you<00:01:37.229> don't<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.619> enough<00:01:37.890> cash<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.369> buy<00:01:38.520> the

and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.240> let<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.420> air<00:01:57.659> dry<00:01:57.689> very<00:01:58.380> well<00:01:58.500> before<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and I let it air dry very well before I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
and I let it air dry very well before I
decided<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.729> use<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.240> let's<00:02:00.780> say<00:02:00.899> for

saver or anything like that what you
want<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.930> manually<00:02:47.500> remove<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.100> much<00:02:48.310> of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
want to do is manually remove as much of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.200 
want to do is manually remove as much of
the<00:02:49.470> oxygen<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.710> this<00:02:51.040> bag<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.460> can<00:02:51.550> so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
the oxygen in this bag as you can so

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.910 
the oxygen in this bag as you can so
basically<00:02:52.540> that's<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.080> be<00:02:53.260> laying

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
basically that's just going to be laying

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550 
basically that's just going to be laying
it<00:02:54.160> down<00:02:54.240> flattening<00:02:55.240> it<00:02:55.450> out<00:02:55.600> as<00:02:55.960> much<00:02:56.200> as

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
it down flattening it out as much as

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.420 
it down flattening it out as much as
possible<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.610> then<00:02:57.910> closing<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:58.930> ziplock

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
possible and then closing your ziplock

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.340 
possible and then closing your ziplock
okay<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.790> would<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.120> that<00:03:01.510> idea<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.020> keep

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
okay so that would be that idea so keep

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.440 
okay so that would be that idea so keep
an<00:03:02.500> eye<00:03:02.590> on<00:03:02.770> all<00:03:02.920> food<00:03:03.430> packaging<00:03:03.970> products<00:03:04.330> to

an eye on all food packaging products to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.090 
an eye on all food packaging products to
see<00:03:04.600> if<00:03:04.690> they<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:04.960> be<00:03:05.080> reused<00:03:05.440> if<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.950> do

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
see if they can be reused if you do

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.950

grow<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> rosemary<00:03:24.100> Bush<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:28.120> also<00:03:28.300> use

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
grow a rosemary Bush and I can also use

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.770 
grow a rosemary Bush and I can also use
this<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.140> help<00:03:29.260> repel<00:03:29.709> insects<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:31.300> well<00:03:31.570> as

this to help repel insects as well as
used<00:03:32.140> for<00:03:32.260> cooking<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:32.890> what<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.640> Drive

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
used for cooking so what I do is I Drive

the<00:03:34.390> rosemary<00:03:34.780> sprigs<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.800> use<00:03:35.950> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
the rosemary sprigs and I use a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.500 
the rosemary sprigs and I use a
dehydrator<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.850> don't<00:03:37.000> have<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.480> can

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
dehydrator but you don't have to you can

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.600 
dehydrator but you don't have to you can
