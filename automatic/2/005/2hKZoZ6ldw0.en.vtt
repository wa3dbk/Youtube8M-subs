obviously<00:02:55.480> i<00:02:56.020> mean<00:02:56.230> i<00:02:56.260> think<00:02:56.530> at<00:02:56.650> three

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
obviously i mean i think at three

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.040 
obviously i mean i think at three
minutes<00:02:57.210> you'll<00:02:58.210> see<00:02:58.450> he's<00:02:58.630> gonna<00:02:58.720> check<00:02:58.960> the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
minutes you'll see he's gonna check the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.510 
minutes you'll see he's gonna check the
score<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.350> about<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> minute<00:02:59.770> or<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.310> about<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
score in about a minute or so in about a

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.610 
score in about a minute or so in about a
couple<00:03:00.730> seconds<00:03:01.150> actually<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.780> he's<00:03:02.410> already

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
couple seconds actually and he's already

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.010 
couple seconds actually and he's already
22<00:03:03.010> kills<00:03:03.460> into<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.180> game<00:03:04.450> right<00:03:04.660> here<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.960> i

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
22 kills into this game right here and i

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.900 
22 kills into this game right here and i
mean<00:03:05.200> that's<00:03:05.410> that's<00:03:05.530> serious<00:03:06.070> damage<00:03:06.490> with

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
mean that's that's serious damage with

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.470 
mean that's that's serious damage with
three<00:03:07.510> minutes<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.930> gameplay<00:03:08.460> so<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:10.360> know

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
three minutes of gameplay so you know

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.110 
three minutes of gameplay so you know
don't<00:03:10.510> underestimate<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.350> power<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:12.120> finding

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
don't underestimate the power of finding

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.080 
don't underestimate the power of finding
