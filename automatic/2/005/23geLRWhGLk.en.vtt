00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.980
 Y 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.720
 If you want your own server 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.130
 minecraft go server mainer dotcom 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.990
 there is a link in the description that you 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.500
 offers a 10% discount on any 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.330
 rent that you want makes it a 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.920
 new command block this time 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 I come to bring this generator 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.850
 mountains in minecraft that is super 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 super cool you know the only thing 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.500
 need this time is how it 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.470
 called a command block in which case 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.379
 well exposed to depp is a name and 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.510
 Eat blog with key so just like 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.220
 in blog and they copy this command and they give 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.870
 -between will automatically give us a 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.579
 command block we're going to put it in 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.989
 anywhere on the floor I in this 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.730
 I want to put it here and 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.110
 we need now a block of rest of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 a block of red ton to do it 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.950
 functional and good before putting it on we're going 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.260
 to position ourselves on the block of 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.670
 commands we open and paste all the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 command that I will leave in the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 description on the top 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.010
 Now let's give done us guide you 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.750
 a little the minecraft but well that's not 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.640
 matter now if we are going to put the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.410
 redstone right next to this block of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.869
 commands and we'll see that it's going to start 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.690
 do all the magic about how you 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.130
 call for this to work 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.480
 artificial mountains good although it 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.340
 they look very natural the truth 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.830
 and good here is the creator who is 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.140
 can you already know that I always like that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.230
 I want to translate here your name 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.840
 command blocks and all that here is 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.610
 to remove the machine and this is for 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.200
 tell us what we have to do then for 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 that works ok first 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.790
 we need a stop block 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.180
 as it is a block of stone we need 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.120
 a block of how fat is called here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.460
 it's grass and we need a custom 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.820
 there it is there we are also a pen 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.380
 a pen that if I'm not wrong holding 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.040
 I think it's called if I'm not going to see where 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.290
 I get the nibs the nibs 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.730
 where almost I will not have to expose a 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.830
 chicken and kill me here directly 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.660
 because then and well then we have 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.950
 everything necessary this time what 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.360
 I have down here in the inventory if 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.650
 they want they can already throw the rest in the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.270
 command block we are not going to 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.310
 need from now on and good 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
 we need for Spain ' a mountain 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.830
 a normal mountain, well, let's go to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 throw a floor stone one a piece 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 of grass thanks as they want 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.260
 call him and a coach so automatically 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.450
 and you will see that as a thing shone 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.680
 abode will give us a little bone and what 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 let's do with this milestone what 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.500
 let's put here it's going to look like a 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.380
 that thing is called that thing and it gave me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.290
 the value as you can see here just 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.310
 create a super mountain but do not create 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.110
 they are on the mountain that I want 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.270
 teach them down is going to be creating 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.270
 the mountain that I want to teach them 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.940
 ah 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.040
 and well, as you can see 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.900
 just created is the super mountain the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.660
 he really decides to wait for me before putting 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.820
 the floating mountain because really 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.580
 this causes quite a long time at the time of 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.710
 that we are planning the whole call the 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.060
 mountain and well 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.650
 I guess he opens them up on camera 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.720
 quick how it was formed with something that gave me 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.600
 roots that look even this one was left 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.040
 piece of how it's called stone and up 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.530
 floating but good I think the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 they are not very natural, let's say 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.190
 but I think they fulfill their function 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.570
 to a small mountain even for 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.060
 People who like to create 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.190
 servers or things like that can have this 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.810
 this blockade command is to do as 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.670
 a circle and inside I put a things 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.500
 well but good morning part of his 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.900
 imagination and you will already be 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.400
 creating but good I'm going to put this on 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.900
 the floating mountain and I'm going to put it 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.670
 also in fast camera because it is that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.270
 It's not very nice to comment while you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.270
 long cause 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.480
 i 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.480
 Y 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.980
 and well as they just looked at it 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.420
 just created the floating mountain the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.190
 truth is that it is super super cool 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.810
 first like it creates a mountain down 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.700
 and everything is automatically passed to 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.870
 up as if they turned the mountain and the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.150
 it's really super that nothing because 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.530
 we even give them the twine here this 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.970
 he remembered how is every wars even 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.890
 they could create their own arenas 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.570
 skywork with this method but the truth 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.090
 is that it's super super cool to me 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.350
 he liked that bad thing that causes 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.660
 at the time they are when the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.460
 mountains but good I left it like this for 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.560
 that will be created but nothing happens to me anymore 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.210
 after they are not conserved the so 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.920
 well something that I wanted to ask 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.720
 while doing this is what happens if 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.760
 I remove the machine it will be removed too 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
 the mountains because they possibly are 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.180
 blocks like artificial ones that 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.370
 remove when I remove the machine but 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.290
 well this I'm going to see now there is 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.730
 loosening they were practically removed already 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.530
 they stay here so if you guys 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.120
 they want to make a mountain better have 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.650
 careful where they do it because it's that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.450
 there is not going to be able to be removed unless 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.850
 that they remove it by hand with some plugin 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.870
 or things like that but well the truth I hope 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.550
 that you liked this video the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.350
 true is one of the best blocks of 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.880
 commands that I liked and good 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.680
 if you liked it you can also 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.810
 leave your like for and share the video 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.700
 so that more people can see it and if 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.560
 it's so well I would appreciate it 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.880
 a lot ok so well I hope that 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.530
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.530
 next we go
