00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.120
 and all good guys who have returned 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.770
 to this new rich comment on the channel 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 of the clans and today boys there 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 we bring a great and truly absurd 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.609
 for one the bonds are made with a knife 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.039
 in the dna of knife precisely made by 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 good rising and sorry map guys 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.510
 but I can't tell you why not a game 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 and I do n't know the maps, but it's fine 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 forgive me there with you I hope fantastic 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 this is enough for you to leave millions of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.129
 light and no boys today a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.719
 to be honest I didn't set 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.180
 no topic to talk about and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 honestly I don't even know well I say 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.149
 making them subject to what I would have 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.860
 so could talk about anything 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.449
 pass here and here we are pulling a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 little and we talk about more and less 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.930
 guys I wanted to tell you my first 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 all about the new call of duty because i 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.550
 guys there are so many rumors around there 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.640
 there was that screenshot he was trying to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.580
 some that the next call of duty 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240
 he would have been call of duty world at war 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.280
 2 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.990
 one thing I see a little unlikely 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.680
 because the series had been closed for quite a while 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.630
 some time 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.909
 anyway okay I don't think it is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 impossible but the most accredited one at 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 moment seems to be black ops between why 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.729
 for millions of reasons because precisely the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 series still open could continue 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 and on wikipedia among other things they are yes they are 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 been checking on on the page of 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 advanced warfare I checked that one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.549
 some information which was there with 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.340
 starting earlier because it comes 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.350
 written which seconds are 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.090
 its the previous ones that were there 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.780
 also written tests later with the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.939
 black ops fee 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 now guys I don't think it is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.909
 reliable because reliable wikipedia 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.250
 at zero percent considering that anyone 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.140
 can edit it too I wrote 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.759
 so many bullshit on wikipedia that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.130
 you can't imagine so I don't know 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.789
 whether to trust me or not I really don't 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 I trust you and boys tell you something 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.229
 when he dedicated some 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 day ago I didn't know what to do because of me 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.319
 the connection was skipped 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.600
 so what did you decide to do I decided 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.189
 to play the ghost campaign ho 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.360
 finished the digos campaign I missed them 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.980
 two three missions and in the last one 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.510
 in the last animation you could see that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.670
 rorc which is the main villain the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.010
 bad is the head of the bad guys 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.010
 which seemed to have actually died not 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.379
 he died and the story is cut short 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.790
 so that is, he is the one who takes you 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.680
 you think you killed him instead 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.790
 that to take back and take you for 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310
 the neck 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.680
 so the story theoretically is not 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.069
 the story is not over 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.109
 so I think it could continue 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.650
 I don't know if this year or the year 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.510
 next again there will be another 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.849
 calorific, however, are almost entirely 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.650
 sure that in one of the next few years there 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.049
 will be just a new one with the screw cost 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.579
 maybe with the citigo 2 think rega ha 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.290
 sucked at all the call of duty 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.500
 ghost who knows what that will be more than 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.030
 ghost two maybe they'll really surprise us 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.989
 at that time they did not endure it anymore 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.889
 so much though, they tried then 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.569
 advanced warfare would also be 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.030
 pretty nice then they put that one 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.139
 cagata of match making done on the basis 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.090
 to the skill and they really lost everything 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.829
 kid really lost everything we open 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 a parenthesis on reverse muscles because 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.250
 I don't know, it seems permissible to speak to me not 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.120
 I don't even have blueside either 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.340
 so do not know what to think 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.810
 But guys, I think that's right, that's the way it is 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 right doing was towards boosting why 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.700
 these bastards put us 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.159
 I put the paxton for one 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.900
 great a great difficulty precisely from 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.989
 make gameplay to not exist this thing 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.030
 here and there is their pabst hunter have 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.220
 obviously tried to get around this 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 rule and in my opinion it is right that it is 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.340
 so why to make absurd gameplay 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.459
 they cannot be done otherwise 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.430
 in my opinion against people who have 23 turns 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.500
 or like you then inside this thing here 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.610
 i quite agree then boh i am 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.409
 personal opinions and no boys 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.480
 Previous ecology was sincerely 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.230
 I was really really disappointed 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.170
 ghost boat I tell you right away I have it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.209
 bought to saint lucia he gave it to me 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.560
 saint lucia and hate when lucia have me 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.440
 given as a gift for my 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.539
 day of holy lucia and I played there 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.859
 playing a little bit I also remember 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.060
 at what level he had arrived I had arrived 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.430
 at level 14 and I said to myself or reign but 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.260
 this will fall just shit and then 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.340
 stopped playing with it, I never again 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.479
 reopened 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.210
 I reopened perhaps for the first time 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.130
 from the other day, let's say from work 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.200
 played the countryside a little bit because me 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.020
 I remember seeing when again 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.150
 I looked fake and did the wall trudi a 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.590
 ghost of ghost just then me 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.539
 liked the campaign will have played a 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.690
 little to that then continued e 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.280
 I finished the other day just me 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.560
 really disappointed after a day want 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.470
 stopped playing black black ops 2 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.789
 instead I didn't like it initially 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.530
 I hadn't even bought it much 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.440
 still my kids did n't buy mine 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.599
 call of duty black ops two is 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.610
 practically alone to that by now is of a 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.440
 my friend think he stole it that is not 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.840
 he steals it as he gave it in theory 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520
 I will make an apple a year and a half ago and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.990
 I'm a year and a half exactly that not 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.550
 he gives it back and I don't think so 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.400
 they never give it back to him then 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.349
 let's say he steals it for nothing 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.520
 I really liked that one 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.979
 at the end after he started 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.160
 play with it a little bit and I've really been 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.510
 glad to play god I didn't 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.690
 great game play because the gameplay 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.340
 but I haven't heard it right now 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.470
 play well then when I didn't know 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.320
 still playing i had a lot of fun e 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.659
 no m3 and black ops two olè 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.039
 played for then mv 3 mv 2 excuse the 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.080
 But I liked the lawyers a bit 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.870
 really much 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.759
 and black ops I played in private with i 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.409
 bot when it was still a bot too 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.610
 that is when I hadn't bought 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.409
 never bought a call of duty 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.659
 when I played with my friends a 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:59.020
 home they played against bots on utah 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.219
 a beautiful private mega and nothing 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.300

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.949
 video of this is now coming 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.590
 at the end I hope this that 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.659
 while you enjoyed it if so 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.830
 dislike to leave a nice one if the 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.569
 you liked gameplay left in a 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.400
 else don't get another account for 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.139
