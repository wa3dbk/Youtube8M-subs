00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 In general, a lot of things have changed for me 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.730
 since the teapot in which I brew bosom 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800

 teapot that che can not interfere 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.900
 if you fill up the player here and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.420

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.270
 I donâ€™t know what it is all about 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.900

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 when you brew in 1 cup of power 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 then overlap the tea here by mixing 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.210

 after you spent your teahouse 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.640

 functionally they will not steam 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.840
 because now they cost me here 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.050

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.170

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.200
 many already on faith in the spoons once 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.330

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.249
