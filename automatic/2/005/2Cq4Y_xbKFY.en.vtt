00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 their recent book purchases and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.090
 there were only 2 last present purchases 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.980
 time so it is that I read books 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.200
 either electronically or me them 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 borrow friends so i am shopping 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
 you can say no need 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 but something I still bought first 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
 the book anabiosis sergey paliy and alexei 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.119
 Gravitsky I have long been interested in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.500
 series of anabiosis because I know that her 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 founder is founder Sergey 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 Pali I simply could not pass by 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.980
 this and now completely unexpected 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.420
 I saw several books from this series in 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.910
 store read city 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 naturally could not buy surprised 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.920
 I was a godsend because this series 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.840
 published in 2011 and usually books 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
 published and at this time we have a very difficult 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.770
 find and by the way most recently in one of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 shops I found all the books in the series 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 hibernation absolutely ridiculous prices so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 now going to myself 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 buy 2 purchase is also absolutely 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 spontaneously and these are Kolyma stories 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.670
 Shalamov did not expect to see Varlam 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.289
 this artwork in this design but 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 as soon as she saw immediately decided 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.750
 I learned to buy about this piece 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.479
 after the story Nastya Savor and that 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 thank you very much very interested 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.229
 These stories I think that soon 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.799
 nothing about sunrise michael 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.930
 Zoshchenko 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.490
 I adore this book and adore it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.130
 registration so I was very glad 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 get a gift by the way with the order 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 sara dot ru I got something country 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.930
 this is this kind of like a novel collection 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.229
 which costs only 20 rubles to me 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.329
 even wondering how awful 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 maybe this is given the design 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.170
 the price of the read and it naturally will not 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.000
 best friend knowing my boundless 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 love of the show how i met your 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.149
 Mom gave me two such codes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.860
 bros I really like them for 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.670
 one evening natural both of these books 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 they read very funny and very 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 reminiscent of the series but also my friend 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.909
 of course bro so I thought that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.500
 in a few years nostalgia will appear 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.079
 when i will look into these books 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 collector john fowles long wanted 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.090

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.150
 Ulema Palanga hut

 this book was in a dust jacket but this one 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.250
 I have already thrown out the super cover, but because 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.230
 I do not see any sense she is absolutely 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.069
 matches this cover jack london
