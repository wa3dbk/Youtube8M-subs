00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 hello people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.560
 video of me today I'll show you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.000
 again a beauty basic and indeed 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.770
 guti trend autumn maybe 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.429
 Just heard on instagram there is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.170
 as through what else almost roping us 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.179
 strong you declare today and me 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
 show you also what you bread and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.279
 Water is juice and how it works 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.279
 stay tuned 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.900
 doping is a make up technique 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.689
 not necessarily new for make up 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.460
 artist has long been known but yes the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.439
 trends in seep always like that every now and then 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.010
 out to the end user as well as art 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.260
 and arrived now it was quasi 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 but marry only on the float 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 So the right glow certainly 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.020
 I like glow and that's why it's full 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020
 my thinking 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.399
 that means you high points the sun 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.340
 normally would hit something like that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.930
 like cheekbones bull nose bridge the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.400
 But trees emphasizes not prefer one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.070
 highlight chemistry it's used to with 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.170
 a lighter product but it has to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.170
 To be difficult that is very important 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.420
 the opposite of culture we want 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.729
 do not emphasize the shadow or 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.070
 put a shadow on your face but we 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.899
 want to bring into light the face 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.729
 soffin can also be completely on 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.659
 Contour is waived so no 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.340
 water 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.909
 that gives the nice one more 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.490
 summer faithful look especially there is 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.649
 contour through which the reverse contour so 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.509
 because of the hardened points 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.200
 The face drips somehow 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.200
 contoured 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.880
 I personally like to take part in the event 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.230
 summer creamy products but I show 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.020
 mix it up today 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.730
 training and brother products with it 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.470
 Effect also comes out really well 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.440
 I prefer creamy products 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 simply insert your finger 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.500
 then you can also best on 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.170
 Wear and you always see that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.720
 so a little bit runs and that 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.599
 I connect with the eyes on the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.370
 Next point is the nose back her 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.569
 you have to imagine exactly there 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.760
 always place where you have the light and 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.860
 just wanted to throw the attention 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.980
 So what should really be accentuated 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.010
 what shall be seen there 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.870
 you pass your highlighter and if 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.959
 So you like, for example, one 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.989
 Just look over the eyebrows and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.880
 Although here at the highest point or exactly 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.380
 but on the forehead but here do that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.900
 I personally do not like that so much because I like that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.790
 a thesis a bit of oil I am and 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.319
 Does it feel a bit fat? I leave that alone 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.970
 I'll do it the way I do 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.209
 otherwise it would do too 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.519
 very pretty is on the lips heart 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.930
 it also makes a difference 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.940
 so a little bit the effect that one 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.109
 has fuller lips and you can also one 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.109
 give little on chin 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.030
 that is now the final result of 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.030
 streaming with a creamy product 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.440
 but now want more in the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.180
 I still need a brother products 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 Now that's a bit golden 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.770
 so bright golden shimmers and indeed can 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.099
 I recommend you this two island 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.130
 either for a very light one 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.110
 that's just kind of a fan 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.270
 brush quite well because the only way 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.310
 gets a very light application 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.959
 and you can also target that way 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 Apply apply 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.980
 but I also really like this one here 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.810
 of the top so a bit rounded and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.580
 especially very fluid that is quite 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.250
 Good that we do not brush too hard 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.440
 tied it is very important otherwise 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.540
 her not so easy this hand 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.430
 and he comes out too much product now 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 just go straight over the breastfeeding 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.690
 pressure not only reinforces that 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.430
 result but also holds the usa 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.109
 I'll go back with mine afterwards 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.950
 fingering it is very important too 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.810
 dazzle 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.419
 so you do not really just one 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.550
 point it off and if it's too much 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.229
 has become or too far in the middle 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.250
 has fallen or something to upload your 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.250
 take youtube countries 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.370
 both can not come up with that exactly 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.620
 here and in the eye on the button may 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.380
 nothing matters and I would stop 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.069
 also recommend to take care 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.870
 in the frontal area not too far in too 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.639
 go or if you are a little quieter 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.710
 skin has to let the whole thing out 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.900
 Maybe that's the way everything is now 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.360
 I hope you like the video now 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.550

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.500

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.500

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.849
 I'll do that next and now 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.500
 every case a nice thing for the 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.570
 summer especially you can do it 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.270
 Try and you can still 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.289
