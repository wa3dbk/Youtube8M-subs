 you do not have stabilizer and you want to do 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.030
 a firmer cream I'll let you down 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.340
 the description a link with some 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 advice the first thing we have to 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 to do is sift the yeast 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 and the flour 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.330
 once we have it sieved 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
 We put the preheated oven to 170 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
 degrees purchased by the rule below 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.720
 then we put the butter in 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.120
 a container and add the sugar 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.940
 and we will beat it until it is integrated 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.940
 well and take a whitish hue 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.050
 once the two ingredients are 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.140
 well integrated let's add the egg 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.150
 we are going to add those of 11 and until one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.569
 not fully integrated we do not add 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.569
 the other 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.170
 once you already have a built 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.170
 we add the other one and we beat again 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 we have already integrated the two eggs well 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.989
 that now we're going to add half of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.290
 the flour and the yeast that we had 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.450
 previously sifted and we go back to 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.450
 beat our mixture at low speed 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.520
 we already have half the flour 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.810
 integrated so let's add the 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.500
 milk 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.500
 and the vanilla extract 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.299
 and we beat again 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.510
 then add the flour that already 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.200
 we are left and we beat it at low speed 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.720
 again until everything is integrated 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.400
 we already have our mass ready and also 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.319
 we have prepared the tray that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.120
 let's make our cupcake in a 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.129
 special tray to make mamés and 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.170
 cupcakes in which we have placed the 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.510
 capsules if you do not have this tray 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.700
 you can put your capsules how it is and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 so it will not open to you if you want to know the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
 study jumping model using os 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.330
 I'll leave it down in a link the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.020
 description now with a utensil for 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.570
 make ice cream balls 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.920
 let's do let's take this 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.670
 quantity 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 and we are going to put in the capsule 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.260
 and so we're going to do to fill all 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.650
 the capsules and that we run out of 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.650
 Apple 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.700
 and in another oven is preheated well 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.190
 that we have put our tray and what 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.440
 we have left 170 degrees with heat for 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.810
 up and down and wait for it 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.959
 make while our cupcake is baked 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.200
 let's put the water in a saucepan and 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.120
 let's add the sugar let's put it 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.190
 on a high heat and let's wait until 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.520
 let it boil once it starts to boil 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.300
 we put out the fire 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.590
 we would achieve 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.810
 and we add our vanilla essence 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.480
 we move it well and we have ready 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.519
 our syrup if you are going to use the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.160
 Vanilla sugar you do not have to add 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.510
 at the beginning like the other sugar so 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.310
 we will wait for it to cool the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.140
 syrup while finishing baking 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.300
 our cupcakes in my case have passed 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.220
 30 minutes and they're ready so 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.490
 let's take it out of the oven 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.130
 we turn off the oven 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.639
 and we will check that they are made with 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.639
 a pinch 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.169
 you see how it comes out clean so now 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.360
 let's make a few holes 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.360
 to each of the cupcakes well 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.050
 to put the syrup once 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.720
 that we have already done the little holes 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.750
 we've all taken it out of the mold and we're going 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.340
 to put the syrup is very important 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.540
 that we put it on when still 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.540
 cupcakes are hot 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.990
 we have already put the syrup to all and 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.970
 now let's let cool for 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.610
 be able to decorate them while cooling 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.590
 let's move on to make the dough to make 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.169
 the whipped cream the first thing you have 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.819
 What to know is that both cream and 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.770
 container in which we are going to do as 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.229
 the blender rods should be 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.539
 very cold once everything is cold 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.979
 we put the cream in the container and 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.379
 we begin to beat with the rods 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.379
 until the cream is a bit famous 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.160
 once the cream is a bit we are going to 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.160
 add the icing sugar 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.849
 vanilla sugar 2 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.370
 and the cream stabilizer and let's 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.370
 Beat at the beginning of the cream completely 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.940
 the cream is already completely assembled 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.820
 As you can see it is very firm and has 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.920
 some yellowish furrows as yet not 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.100
 it's in our cold cupcakes all 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.050
 we are going to put a film and we are going to 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.060
 store in the refrigerator until 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.000
 are completely cold to be able 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.250
 decorate ours that are already cold 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.260
 so we can go on to decorate the 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.330
 caught a pastry bag I put 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.900
 it's nozzle and we're going to fill it 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.920
 we do it and we put it inside and 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:36.040
 we put it in the glass 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.740
 we open like this and with the help of a language 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.360
 pastry we are going to fill them with the 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.520
 cream that we have taken out of the fridge 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.409
 and we have filled the pastry bag and 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.889
 let's move on to decorate our cupcake 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:52.310
 let's make breathing simple from 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.310
 outside 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.710
 inward 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.699
 and when we finish, I'm going to put a 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.310
 chocolate ball in my case and I'm going to 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:14.680
 sprinkle it over a little bit of 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.020
 pink sugar 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.370
 and our cupcakes are ready I'm going to 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.590
 do the same with the five that we 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.870
 we are finished decorating 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.960
 all the cupcakes and you can see what 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.870
