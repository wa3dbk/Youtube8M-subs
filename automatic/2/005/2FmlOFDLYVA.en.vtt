00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
only Xcode in my collection at the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.880 
only Xcode in my collection at the
moment<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.600> near<00:00:51.870> mint<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.289> mint<00:00:52.440> +

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
moment and it's a near mint to mint +

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
moment and it's a near mint to mint +
condition<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.030> absolutely<00:00:54.360> flawless<00:00:56.149> at

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
condition it's absolutely flawless at

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.590 
condition it's absolutely flawless at
first<00:00:57.390> glance<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.730> perfect<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.449> it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
first glance it's like perfect but it's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
first glance it's like perfect but it's
got<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.170> minor<00:01:01.590> surface<00:01:01.949> scratches

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
got the most minor surface scratches

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
got the most minor surface scratches
like<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.170> minor<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.890> they're<00:01:04.979> really

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
like just so minor and they're really

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
like just so minor and they're really
hard<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.760> unless<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> tilt<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> certain

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
hard to see unless you tilt it a certain

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
hard to see unless you tilt it a certain
angle<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.640> close<00:01:08.909> under

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
angle and get it really close under

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
angle and get it really close under
light<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> um<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:13.200> sending<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:13.830> PSA

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
light but um but I'm sending it into PSA

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.210 
light but um but I'm sending it into PSA
and<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:14.970> predicting<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
and I'm predicting that it will get a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.690 
and I'm predicting that it will get a
PSA<00:01:17.220> 8<00:01:17.460> grading<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:18.600> isn't<00:01:18.930> bad<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> yeah

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
PSA 8 grading which isn't bad so yeah

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
PSA 8 grading which isn't bad so yeah
i'll<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.970> sending<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:21.930> soon<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
i'll be sending that in pretty soon and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.330 
i'll be sending that in pretty soon and
i'll<00:01:22.530> show<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.830> guys<00:01:23.100> when<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.330> back
