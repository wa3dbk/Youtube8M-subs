 [Music] 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 good hello to everyone I am always no 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.710
 themes and welcome to jak and daxter a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.190
 game that I've never played though 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.090
 I played a lot at 22 jack 3 and got it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.070
 beloveds so let's see here I passed the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.619
 life trying to give answers to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.480
 questions that my father is my father 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.539
 father 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.520
 needlessly other equal fuck why 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.250
 they created the great monoliths 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 we see every drop on the whole planet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.200
 in my blood tells me of all the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.710
 answers lie on the shoulders of a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 young man unaware of his fate to which he does not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.350
 interested in gods don't tell me that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.539
 and the former is already refusing I believe I pray you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.039
 it's not so much the part because it should 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 listen to the middle samus it seems 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:09.020
 profound reasoning answers are born 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.020
 simply disobedience or not 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.260
 come here 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 ok 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 these are the bad guys in take 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.270
 continue your search for artifacts e 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.720
 with the natives they have objects 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.179
 Please you know what it does a little 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.009
 Ligurian problems anyone dares 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.689
 leave the village for the rest 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.979
 I will attack a good time 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.020
 in short, we're doing jack here 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 this place gives me the creeps them 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.000
 you do well and you never speak either 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.429
 when there is this the rest does not play 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.459
 calm the case they consider it to do 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.170
 dark does not promise minute of man 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.299
 now if I have to tell the truth to your books 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.679
 i like batteries but sisters 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.289
 according to me books of our songs 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.009
 of the starters 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.009
 how the hell did you do 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:33.180
 but what do you do all ass if it won't happen 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:40.650
 no remorse and jack so you are the son of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:51.170
 ex tore canu finish in you're a little hairy 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:55.260
 little calm feeling or not 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.260
 written letters and oh well he thought so of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.519
 dexter if more thread so now you can 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:27.000
 know what you want from me 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:34.590
 2 because in my opinion the transformation 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.180
 a noticeable improvement as much as one 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.459
 person already studied in the woods 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.479
 long enough to let you come back 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:47.790
 the after now g 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:51.629
 never in the past far north no one 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.150
 for years, in the future, will carry the e 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.979
 but unfortunately I can't do it since 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.109
 of the three wise men who hold i 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.780
 we have no news about teleports 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.310
 from time immemorial however not always 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.859
 tells you what you do with a transporter 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.859
 if you can't do it when personal 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.790
 you could try to fly over it if you had 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.469
 a zoom 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.090
 of heat by pure chance I would be 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.459
 working on a trinket like that in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.229
 these days I would need only 20 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.210
 battery andrea enough energy to 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:33.490
 resist the heat of the route genius 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:34.750
 pavia of tutorials with this then 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.240
 break my balls 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.130
 when cazzola I understood three batteries 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.000
 three batteries 3 bacteria that inform you 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.979
 the batteries 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.849
 I have no idea I have to jump many of you 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.710
 then to run faster than 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:05:01.410
 some appeals in practice the third 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.410
 crash mask mar has as core 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.030
 I must say that the movement system 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.669
 naturally equal to 2 to 3 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.400
 I really liked the way it was 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.780
 moves the new cus treble 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.600
 I really like what you do not do 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.990
 the muscles of the plants grow 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.340
 okay if i leave as far as you are 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.370
 unpleasant 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.070
 sure that one also proposes to go to 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.340
 take a bath here that they shoot 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:38.370
 I do not believe what we are on 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.449
 put on is called curling well then me 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:47.699
 I would say that these coverde are released 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:49.919
