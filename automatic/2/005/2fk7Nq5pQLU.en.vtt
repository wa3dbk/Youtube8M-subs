00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 these 30 m kilowatt engine to press and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.690
 rolled 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:18.779
 750 you and the engine on the dosage of grain 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.720
 250 watt working part and remote 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.090
 control with temperature sensor and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:30.330
 ammeter now we show the launch 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 extruder before starting work 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.489
 open we have to make sure the pleasure 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 the gap we tighten the nut until it stops 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.629
 until it hits the auger and do 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.629
 full one and a half turn back 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.850
 thereby we have a gap a half 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.770
 turnover is the optimal clearance for work 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.770
 this extruder on any kind of ground 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.280
 bunker bunker extruder we have grain 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:22.670
 prepared with humidity 18 20 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.820
 percent and for launch we are preparing 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.460
 wheat 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.840
 23 kilograms very moist 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.520
 literally that many grams 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.580
 three hundred to four hundred water study must 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:43.399
 stand for half an hour want this grain for 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.399
 start up turn on the engine itself 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.350
 serve in small portions to return 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 receptionist 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.869
 it is served evenly 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.869
 though what 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.060
 we look that you are great again 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.060
 rested and did not stand the same 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.810
 here we see how the test starts to come out 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.380
 temperature at startup we had 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.530
 sensors in minus 4 degrees 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.849
 now already 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.020
 there is 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.700
 see difficult to return 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.800
 sold from bunker 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.480
 We are serving a very small amount yesterday 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.530
 because 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.530
 he promises not warmed up 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.140
 time we continue to run 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.140
 glasenap protein 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.310
 rotate twenty four twenty 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.310
 five degrees 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.520
 1 of 2 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.840
 grain is very important to serve 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.180
 continuously 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.370
 the same if the apartment will be served 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.629
 affected later 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.629
 here's a hand shot 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.550
 high temperature 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.450
 950 she squeezed 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.239
 tivation 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.340
 clap sport and 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.350
 skin must look very 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.340
 slowly begin to be almost 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.020
 grabs a little bit add 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.729
 heating performance 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.770
 not in a hurry 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.240
 dating that stock is small he has 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.240
 performance guys 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.280
 will be 335 now I look about 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.980
 vocals 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.710
 so on two drills 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.080
 where more is it already 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.080
 he hasn't caught fire work about 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.590
 Now tell me about the game well, 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.949
 it is his soul then the output at the last 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.949
 cable 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.570
 try 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.870
 how meters 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.740
 continuously girls 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.430
 polaris work and such an engine 70 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.430
 ampere 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.400
 warm kick 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.810
 over 50 years ampere 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.810
 when the result comes in 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.200
 better sit 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.370
 now 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.760
 you did not confess 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.760
 therapy 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.930
 feed over regulated 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.930
 so 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.320
 now the temperature was already over 100 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.820
 degrees 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.820
 male mode here it is 160 to 180 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.820
 degrees 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.720
 temperature from 120 degrees 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:09.370
 the flow of us is still small because 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.690
 squeal not charges for his work with 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.690
 its working temperature 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.139
 but 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.110
 right light we use 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.319
 marry barley and corn in equal 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.319
 proportions 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.640
 Now we will show you how it works. 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.640
 horse and punisher 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.300
 you will control the machine back
