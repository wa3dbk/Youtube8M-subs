00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.650
 could perhaps kawasaki stay away 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.279
 from the challenge in the maxi segment 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.710
 naked 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.199
 the answer is absolutely not here 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.570
 in fact the e 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.400
 renewed z1000 revised and developed for 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.320
 offer even more driving pleasure e 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.210
 even better performance 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.710
 the work of Japanese technicians is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.870
 focused on the chassis with 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.390
 evolutions both to the braking system and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.780
 to the suspensions the new z1000 that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.420
 now in its fourth generation and yes 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.970
 confirms undisputed leader for the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.510
 personalities in the super segment 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.739
 naked by an extremely style 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.440
 aggressive indeed if we have to be honest 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.570
 was born from just one 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.269
 the Italian word that I transferred to 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 Japanese designer who is bad 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.140
 resumes the shapes of an animal of a 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.470
 feline in the moment before hunting one 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.630
 taking a very low head lower 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.610
 of the shoulder just in the moment of 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 attacking this was the concept 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.970
 dynamic expressing this form of 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.970
 design 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.360
 the real novelty of the kawasaki stand is 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.240
 but the debut of the akashi brand 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.280
 in the ejei 300 scooter segment 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.280
 seems to be just the first step 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.179
 we enter the scooter world ever 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.039
 kawasaki has produced such a medium 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.860
 we did it in collaboration with a 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.450
 strategic partner for us with whom 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.909
 we already have 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:58.119
 and other collaborations for which it is born 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.820
 on a mechanic already tested and to which 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.740
 we have added all of ours 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.060
 that of knowledge in terms of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.030
 design quality 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.889
 of satisfaction that we are used to 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.489
 give to customers 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.489
