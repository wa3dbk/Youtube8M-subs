00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
game myself and i think that's how it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.999 
game myself and i think that's how it
should<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.909> i<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.450> parents<00:02:00.750> should

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
should be i don't think parents should

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
should be i don't think parents should
fight<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.040> their<00:02:02.490> children<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.420> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
fight for their children and like I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.109 
fight for their children and like I
don't<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.860> parenting<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:06.000> be

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
don't know it's not good parenting to be

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.550 
don't know it's not good parenting to be
promoting<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.719> instead<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.320> should<00:02:07.469> be

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
promoting that instead they should be

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
promoting that instead they should be
barnum<00:02:07.890> sports<00:02:08.160> games<00:02:08.459> or<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.060> games

single day for the past two and a half
three<00:02:21.819> weeks<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.930> feel<00:02:23.500> great<00:02:23.680> and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
three weeks and I feel great and

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.800 
three weeks and I feel great and
honestly<00:02:24.370> exercise<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.180> best<00:02:25.270> thing<00:02:25.690> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
honestly exercise is the best thing you

honestly exercise is the best thing you
could<00:02:25.959> possibly<00:02:25.990> do<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:27.340> make<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.030> feel

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
could possibly do to make you feel

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.380 
could possibly do to make you feel
better<00:02:28.569> as<00:02:28.870> both<00:02:29.590> self-esteem<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.520> mental

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
better as both self-esteem and mental

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.350 
better as both self-esteem and mental
mentally<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.850> pretty<00:02:34.060> much<00:02:34.150> my

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
mentally so that's pretty much my

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.620 
mentally so that's pretty much my
biggest<00:02:34.720> honest<00:02:35.260> advice<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:37.150> keep

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
biggest honest advice is do keep
