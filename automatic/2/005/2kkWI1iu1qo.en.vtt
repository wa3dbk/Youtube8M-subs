think it's about time to you know see

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.190 
think it's about time to you know see
our<00:02:58.760> fate<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.660> can<00:02:59.810> see<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.080> not

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
our fate and as you can see it's not

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.660 
our fate and as you can see it's not
looking<00:03:00.470> good<00:03:00.590> for<00:03:00.650> us<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.100> two<00:03:01.310> points

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
looking good for us we have two points

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.190 
looking good for us we have two points
from<00:03:01.760> our<00:03:01.880> first<00:03:02.090> five<00:03:02.330> games<00:03:02.600> which<00:03:02.989> is

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
from our first five games which is

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.310 
from our first five games which is
absolutely<00:03:03.920> shocking<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.459> know<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.420> we<00:03:06.170> are

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
absolutely shocking I know but we are

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.410 
absolutely shocking I know but we are
going<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.860> have<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.370> away<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.300> can

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
going to have to go away and see we can

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.080 
going to have to go away and see we can
make<00:03:08.570> them<00:03:08.720> into<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.380> think<00:03:10.010> three<00:03:10.820> wins

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
make them into that I think three wins

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.759 
make them into that I think three wins
and<00:03:11.300> one<00:03:11.510> draw<00:03:11.720> out<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.110> our<00:03:12.230> five<00:03:12.470> remaining

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
and one draw out of our five remaining

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.280 
and one draw out of our five remaining
games<00:03:13.040> will<00:03:13.370> see<00:03:13.610> us<00:03:13.760> into<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.480> safe<00:03:14.690> zone<00:03:14.989> and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
games will see us into the safe zone and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
games will see us into the safe zone and
another<00:03:15.680> division<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.370> sit<00:03:17.269> or<00:03:17.420> another

it<00:04:27.270> does<00:04:27.419> mean<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.320> know<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.770> a

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
it does mean that we you know have a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.620 
it does mean that we you know have a
chance<00:04:29.160> now<00:04:29.430> actually<00:04:29.940> looks<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.419> it's

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
chance now actually looks like it's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.240 
chance now actually looks like it's
doable<00:04:30.960> worse<00:04:31.230> before<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.680> didn't<00:04:31.860> look<00:04:31.950> even

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
doable worse before it didn't look even

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.159 
doable worse before it didn't look even
remotely<00:04:32.280> possible<00:04:32.700> we<00:04:33.600> only<00:04:33.780> need<00:04:33.990> seven

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
remotely possible we only need seven

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.800 
remotely possible we only need seven
points<00:04:34.650> from<00:04:34.830> four<00:04:35.490> games<00:04:35.520> i<00:04:36.030> believe<00:04:36.300> to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
points from four games i believe to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.630 
points from four games i believe to
actually<00:04:37.169> end<00:04:37.350> up<00:04:37.530> staying<00:04:38.010> in<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.340> division

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
actually end up staying in the division

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.860 
actually end up staying in the division

the<00:05:30.870> lowest<00:05:31.080> by<00:05:31.350> now<00:05:31.590> which<00:05:31.830> makes<00:05:32.070> absolutely

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
the lowest by now which makes absolutely

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.340 
the lowest by now which makes absolutely
no<00:05:32.880> sense<00:05:33.210> because<00:05:33.600> they're<00:05:33.900> sitting<00:05:34.200> there

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
when they could just probably go off and

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.360 
when they could just probably go off and
buy<00:05:38.669> one<00:05:38.970> with<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> by<00:05:40.140> now<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.650> don't<00:05:40.979> understand

three goals in the first half but after

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.809 
three goals in the first half but after
the<00:06:20.780> halftime<00:06:21.020> you<00:06:21.650> know<00:06:21.770> I<00:06:21.800> came<00:06:22.009> out<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.550> had<00:06:22.789> a

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819

much better performance I was all over

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.249 
much better performance I was all over
him<00:06:24.860> but<00:06:25.460> because<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.970> was<00:06:26.090> ultra<00:06:26.360> attacking<00:06:26.900> he

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
him but because I was ultra attacking he

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.749 
him but because I was ultra attacking he
eventually<00:06:27.500> went<00:06:27.800> through<00:06:28.069> on<00:06:28.310> the<00:06:28.400> counter

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759

episode<00:06:36.020> with<00:06:36.139> a<00:06:36.169> pinch<00:06:36.349> of<00:06:36.470> salt<00:06:36.680> I<00:06:36.830> guess

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
episode with a pinch of salt I guess

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.800 
episode with a pinch of salt I guess
managing<00:06:37.699> to<00:06:37.789> win<00:06:37.819> our<00:06:38.030> first<00:06:38.300> game<00:06:38.479> in

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
managing to win our first game in

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.869 
managing to win our first game in
Division<00:06:39.139> three<00:06:39.169> but<00:06:39.800> also<00:06:40.009> losing<00:06:40.729> another

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
Division three but also losing another

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.330 
Division three but also losing another
one<00:06:41.120> so<00:06:41.360> now<00:06:41.930> it's<00:06:42.169> looking<00:06:42.289> very<00:06:42.500> difficult

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
one so now it's looking very difficult

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.189 
one so now it's looking very difficult
because<00:06:43.699> now<00:06:43.940> we<00:06:44.000> need<00:06:44.180> to<00:06:44.210> win<00:06:44.389> two<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:45.020> draw

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
because now we need to win two and draw

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.480 
because now we need to win two and draw
one<00:06:45.409> we<00:06:45.530> can't<00:06:45.710> afford<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:46.009> lose<00:06:46.069> a<00:06:46.190> single

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
one we can't afford to lose a single

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.520 
one we can't afford to lose a single
game<00:06:46.639> or<00:06:47.120> otherwise<00:06:47.569> we<00:06:47.840> are<00:06:47.870> going<00:06:48.289> to<00:06:48.409> be

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
game or otherwise we are going to be

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.339 
game or otherwise we are going to be
relegated<00:06:49.159> which<00:06:49.699> isn't<00:06:50.030> too<00:06:50.419> good<00:06:50.719> but<00:06:51.289> I

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
relegated which isn't too good but I

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.659 
relegated which isn't too good but I
guess<00:06:51.469> it's<00:06:51.800> not<00:06:51.889> the<00:06:52.009> end<00:06:52.039> of<00:06:52.250> the<00:06:52.310> world<00:06:52.430> that

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
guess it's not the end of the world that

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.369 
guess it's not the end of the world that
does<00:06:52.879> up<00:06:53.000> and<00:06:53.150> we<00:06:53.210> still<00:06:53.389> get<00:06:53.509> coins<00:06:53.719> for<00:06:54.050> it<00:06:54.169> so

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
does up and we still get coins for it so

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.800 
does up and we still get coins for it so
you<00:06:55.129> know<00:06:55.250> that<00:06:55.669> might<00:06:55.849> be<00:06:55.969> a<00:06:56.000> good<00:06:56.060> thing<00:06:56.360> so

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
you know that might be a good thing so

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.149 
you know that might be a good thing so
