00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that right now I believe him the last

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
that right now I believe him the last
person<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:23.189> trying<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> circumnavigate

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
person and I'm trying to circumnavigate

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
person and I'm trying to circumnavigate
the<00:01:24.420> map<00:01:24.630> try<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.080> catch<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.350> off<00:01:25.439> guard

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the map try and catch them off guard

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
the map try and catch them off guard
because<00:01:26.009> they<00:01:26.909> assume<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.540> course<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.990> I'm

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because they assume of course that I'm

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.670 
because they assume of course that I'm
going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> plant<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:29.360> be<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> find<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
going to plant at be because I find it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.219 
going to plant at be because I find it
easier<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.040> FNB<00:01:32.340> than<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.360> thought<00:01:34.110> I'd

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
easier to FNB than a but I thought I'd

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.219 
easier to FNB than a but I thought I'd
switch<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> him<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.110> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
switch it up on him and I got a lot of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
switch it up on him and I got a lot of
positive<00:01:37.590> feedback<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.369> grind<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.850> gears
