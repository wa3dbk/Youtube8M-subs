fish and flow for citronella labium and
then<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.369> Carroll<00:01:50.369> cichlids<00:01:50.790> again

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
then also the Carroll cichlids again

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
then also the Carroll cichlids again
here<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> pair<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> them<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> foreground

the<00:04:24.100> difference<00:04:24.520> between<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.080> Citra

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the difference between this is the Citra

the hump is not quite there and of
course<00:04:32.860> there's<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> lot<00:04:33.280> more<00:04:33.490> smaadahl<00:04:34.210> Doran

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
course there's a lot more smaadahl Doran

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.860 
course there's a lot more smaadahl Doran
jizz<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:34.840> whites<00:04:35.430> whereas<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.870> Midas

cichlids<00:04:38.290> which<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.040> citronella<00:04:39.520> tend<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
cichlids which is citronella tend to

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.480 
cichlids which is citronella tend to
have<00:04:40.120> much<00:04:41.020> bigger<00:04:41.230> humps<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.860> more<00:04:42.040> blunt<00:04:42.340> or

have much bigger humps and more blunt or
snouts<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.410> that's<00:04:44.410> one<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.950> them<00:04:45.100> back<00:04:45.790> there

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
snouts and that's one of them back there

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.100 
snouts and that's one of them back there
again<00:04:48.250> there's<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.730> whole<00:04:48.970> pile<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.570> different

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
Citroen Elms in the tank and there's

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.910 
Citroen Elms in the tank and there's
another<00:05:23.440> one<00:05:23.680> there<00:05:25.230> again<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.410> can<00:05:26.590> see<00:05:26.770> the

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
another one there again you can see the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.540 
another one there again you can see the
big<00:05:27.130> big<00:05:27.820> nuchal<00:05:28.810> hump<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:30.190> humps<00:05:30.460> are

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
big big nuchal hump the humps are

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.920 
big big nuchal hump the humps are
generally<00:05:32.490> based<00:05:33.490> on<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.240> dominance<00:05:34.810> of<00:05:34.870> the

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
generally based on the dominance of the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.450 
generally based on the dominance of the
fish<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.410> more<00:05:35.590> dominant<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.100> male<00:05:36.280> the

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
fish the more dominant the male the

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.790 
fish the more dominant the male the
bigger<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.790> hump<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:38.230> course<00:05:38.260> it<00:05:38.620> also

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
bigger the hump is and of course it also

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.860 
bigger the hump is and of course it also
has<00:05:39.160> to<00:05:39.370> do<00:05:39.490> with<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.820> size<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.330> fish<00:05:40.570> and

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
has to do with the size of the fish and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.240 
has to do with the size of the fish and
nutrition<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.500> what-have-you

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
nutrition and what-have-you

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.300 
nutrition and what-have-you
so<00:05:43.980> this<00:05:44.980> is<00:05:46.110> again<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.170> Nicaraguan<00:05:47.530> tank<00:05:48.130> in

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
so this is again a Nicaraguan tank in

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.300 
so this is again a Nicaraguan tank in
the<00:05:48.400> background<00:05:48.910> you<00:05:49.000> can<00:05:49.180> see<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.980> big<00:05:50.980> cave

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
the background you can see a big cave

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.500 
the background you can see a big cave
which<00:05:51.670> is<00:05:51.910> where<00:05:52.530> typically<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.710> Paris

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510

Devils or - cichlids whatever happens to
be<00:05:59.920> spawning<00:06:00.310> they<00:06:00.550> tend<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:00.910> take<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.650> that

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
be spawning they tend to take that that

be spawning they tend to take that that
cave<00:06:03.310> back<00:06:03.610> there<00:06:03.850> it's<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.450> prized<00:06:04.720> place

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
cave back there it's the prized place

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.380 
cave back there it's the prized place
for<00:06:05.350> spawning<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:06.520> other<00:06:06.640> thing<00:06:06.850> that's<00:06:06.970> kind
