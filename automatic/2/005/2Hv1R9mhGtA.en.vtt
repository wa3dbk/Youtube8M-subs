00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the MC pro servers pretty soon they're

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.830 
the MC pro servers pretty soon they're
really<00:01:41.759> powerful<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.479> should<00:01:42.659> hold

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
really powerful so they should hold

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
really powerful so they should hold
we're<00:01:43.439> thinking<00:01:43.860> 200<00:01:44.399> slots<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.820> least

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we're thinking 200 slots at least

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.450 
we're thinking 200 slots at least
already<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.590> lag<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.220> might<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
already with no lag but we might be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.539 
already with no lag but we might be
trying<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.360> 25<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.380> some<00:01:49.530> experiments<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.430> we

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
trying to 25 do some experiments when we

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.590 
trying to 25 do some experiments when we
do<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> live<00:01:50.909> streams<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.509> we're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
do the live streams I think we're

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300 
do the live streams I think we're
definitely<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.110> raise<00:01:52.259> both<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.710> 250

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
definitely going to raise both to 250

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.740 
definitely going to raise both to 250
and<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.820> gonna<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.060> hopping<00:01:54.210> between<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and we're gonna be hopping between the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.789 
and we're gonna be hopping between the
two<00:01:54.899> servers<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.710> really

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
two servers so that's gonna be really

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.130 
two servers so that's gonna be really
