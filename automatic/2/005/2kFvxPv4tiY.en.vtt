00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 save all of spaces or if not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 Doctor wise we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 video of between before consulting we are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.040
 reviewing team players again 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.110
 the season 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 the rest of the world today is the turn of 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.900
 kevin salzburg field an outside 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 really interesting right before 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.090
 start but you have seen two games 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 play the four goals but those screen 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.380
 register them all together for i 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.940
 players I'm getting in that case 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 for the four team inspectors has 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.600
 decided that today was then I do 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 more games so you don't have to kiss 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 on that screen anyway 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 really interesting statistics 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's start as always at the exit 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.770
 speed that is really really good 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.800
 incoming cup is a very good exterior 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 fast has a burning acceleration one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.110
 maximum speed sufficient to jump 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.940
 almost all the players of the game jump 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 with tranquility even the very fullbacks 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 strong as marcel walker and then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.830
 very strong fast full-backs 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 the only sin is a little physical strength 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.750
 which is certainly not one of his 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 main qualities however it is not either 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 a lot a problem in the end 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 line with many other externals that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.360
 we have seen this year 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.369
 as far as shooting is concerned, let's start from 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.450
 main problem the problem 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.950
 the main aim of the shot is the finalization 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.960
 organization that is not that of others 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 external so it is not comparable to a 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 exterior as offensive as they can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.240
 observe i ronaldo however is the pajtim 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 decided which were externals that were going 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 more to finalize those of pure wings 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.979
 camp is born as of however it can be found 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.020
 also how they are now so it's a bit 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.790
 more to the cuadrado to understand one 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.829
 player who knows how to do both 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 therefore very good phases to do both the phase 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.939
 offensive that the defensive phase is a lot 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.229
 fast has a good dribbling however the 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.390
 finalization leaves something to be desired 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.729
 pity because the values ​​of the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.649
 shooting are not bad at all a good one 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.200
 shooting power has above all a very good one 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.780
 effect because almost all the goals I have 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.200
 did I mark them or power them like 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.629
 this in front of the goalkeeper or in any case a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.290
 so it is never snowing around lap 4 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.030
 stars 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.950
 if he wants then to enhance both right 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.739
 that of left you can still cross 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.049
 both with strong foot and with weak foot 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.500
 as for dribbling a lot 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.719
 good really good agility 4 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
 star ski so you can do the skills 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.019
 base to practically skip i 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.920
 defenders without doing those anymore 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.530
 complicated by five stars in the passages 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.970
 they are good they are therefore precise 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.000
 player you can exploit for 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.639
 go to the bottom and put in the middle for 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.500
 a physical tip able to soar of 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.629
 head or at least the passages 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.730
 low shot are not sent at all 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.500
 this opening on zarate very much 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.720
 precise with regard to the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.159
 head shot 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.769
 delayed is certainly not in his 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.680
 main qualities so I do not recommend it 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.500
 to cross for him that you feel me there 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.150
 advice for this dedaj player 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.530
 increase the shot the pass of the shot 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.879
 because as we saw the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.680
 finalization not at the top then 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.379
 let's try to give him a few points in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.639
 more or even basic base is fine 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.840
 because anyway it increases all the 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.790
 Field statistics is one of the best 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.440
 exteriors in europe so it does not need 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.650
 to concentrate on a statistic 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.150
 main apart from shooting where 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.419
 use this player for sure 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 a problem which is the fact of playing 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.799
 in austria and to be slovenian therefore of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.479
 not be in the league either 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.299
 more competitive in most nations 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:42.959
 competitive in any case you can put it 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.209
 in a 4 3 3 as a medium to high work 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.609
 so it's also fine as a di or 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.500
 as they are right, however, I do not recommend them 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.540
 it wanders more difficult to hybridize in this 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 case a 4 of the king with from regimes to gem 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.560
 the central point strong physically that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.389
 can lean on the exterior and reus e 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.739
 fields or in this case exploiting 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:05.090
 his tabby teammate goes to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.949
 join the Austrian league excuse a 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.659
 one liga bbva and even two 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.400
 Brazilian players like thiago silva e 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.590
 magic that go to give themselves but denied between 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.079
 of them therefore really no problem is 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.019
 a very good team this very technical 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.530
 because we have alonso coke and campco isco 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.120
 which are four players 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220
 very technical and then we have soriano that 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.800
 makes a bit of a point of union among all 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.639
 these players in conclusion 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.850
 incredible speed accelerations 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.410
 because I'm really at the top in europe 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.840
 good shot at around the middle high workers 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.570
 so it's fine if as of that as of 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 great dribbling 4 star skill how much 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.100
 you are weak foot and agile and expensive 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.290
 only 15 thousand credits therefore one 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.690
 figure within the reach of practically 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.520
 anyone the only problems are 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.530
 finalization which however is not a 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.360
 case desperate institution send us can 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.280
 finalize sees so many where 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.230
 scored with this player and the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.880
 nationality championship which I am not from 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.740
 sure the most competitive in Europe 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.350
 therefore the player absolutely 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.810
 promoted there are rumors that want it or 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.430
 in England or pizza crimes and I say 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.100
 we hope because he is a player to keep 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.690
 especially in a fifa perspective 15 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.380
 so we will see each other soon 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.380
 Hi everyone
