00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.260
 that android is good I have the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.650
 solution that I and 15 have 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.680
 tigo operator and I get in the part of 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.540
 up as if it did not have a good signal 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.380
 let's do the following let's go to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.750
 settings 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 [Music] 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.430
 let's go to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.640
 [Music] 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 options more options 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.070
 mobile networks 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.880
 [Music] 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.910
 and we go network operators 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.170
 [Music] 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.590
 and we give him 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.590
 select automatically 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.460
 and as you can see we have a signal if still 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.610
 by doing that it has not yet been given 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 we give to look for networks 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 on the lid 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.930
 we wait a little 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:31.230
 [Music] 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.630
 and as we see here the two networks appear 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.330
 maybe you get another one depends on 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 its good operator i choose to say 4g 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.150
 emea ws this is a little faster than 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.659
 data internet 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.409
 [Music] 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.510
 says registered on the network and now as 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.580
 come 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.580
 we can call 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.540
 [Music] 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.810
