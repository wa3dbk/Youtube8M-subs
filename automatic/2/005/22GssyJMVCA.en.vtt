what's so new about that it's been done

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.310 
what's so new about that it's been done
in<00:00:18.619> Mesopotamia<00:00:19.340> for<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.880> long<00:00:20.210> time<00:00:20.480> where's

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
difference these days of course is that

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.740 
difference these days of course is that
with<00:00:31.550> recombinant<00:00:31.880> DNA<00:00:32.510> or<00:00:32.689> genetic

with recombinant DNA or genetic

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.920 
with recombinant DNA or genetic
engineering<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:34.129> can<00:00:34.309> transfer<00:00:34.970> genes

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
engineering you can transfer genes

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.670 
engineering you can transfer genes
between<00:00:36.620> species<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.660> in<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.840> topic<00:00:39.530> that

we're<00:00:39.800> covering<00:00:40.040> today<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.880> can<00:00:41.059> take<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.540> gene

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
we're covering today you can take a gene

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.900 
we're covering today you can take a gene
from<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.500> bacterial<00:00:43.129> cell<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.670> gene<00:00:43.879> that's

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
from a bacterial cell a gene that's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.049 
from a bacterial cell a gene that's
involved<00:00:44.450> in<00:00:44.870> herbicide<00:00:45.500> resistance<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.460> you

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
involved in herbicide resistance and you

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.180 
involved in herbicide resistance and you
can<00:00:47.210> put<00:00:47.360> that<00:00:47.540> into<00:00:47.719> important<00:00:48.530> agricultural

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
can put that into important agricultural

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.729 
can put that into important agricultural
crops<00:00:49.579> like<00:00:49.910> cotton<00:00:51.309> canola<00:00:52.309> soya<00:00:52.870> cool<00:00:53.870> and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
crops like cotton canola soya cool and

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.610 
crops like cotton canola soya cool and
this<00:00:55.100> means<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:55.690> farmer<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.930> plant<00:00:57.469> a

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
this means that a farmer to plant a

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.010 
this means that a farmer to plant a
field<00:00:57.890> with<00:00:58.399> these<00:00:58.550> crops<00:00:58.910> allow<00:00:59.600> them<00:00:59.870> to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
field with these crops allow them to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.020 
field with these crops allow them to
grow<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.800> then<00:01:00.890> treat<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.280> whole<00:01:01.430> field<00:01:01.730> with

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
grow and then treat the whole field with

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.049 
grow and then treat the whole field with
herbicide<00:01:02.980> selectively<00:01:03.980> killing<00:01:04.430> off<00:01:04.550> just

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
herbicide selectively killing off just

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.090 
herbicide selectively killing off just
the<00:01:05.119> weeds<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.660> field<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.259> leaving<00:01:06.950> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the weeds in the field and leaving the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.719 
the weeds in the field and leaving the
the<00:01:07.130> crop<00:01:07.670> intact<00:01:08.380> now<00:01:09.380> farmers<00:01:09.680> use<00:01:10.040> GM<00:01:10.430> crops

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the crop intact now farmers use GM crops

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.429 
the crop intact now farmers use GM crops
because<00:01:11.030> they<00:01:11.299> improve<00:01:11.630> yield<00:01:11.990> that's<00:01:12.290> what

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
because they improve yield that's what

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.260 
because they improve yield that's what
they're<00:01:12.619> really<00:01:12.770> after<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.250> course<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.119> they

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
they're really after of course but they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.230 
they're really after of course but they
also<00:01:14.450> save<00:01:15.409> tilling<00:01:15.979> which<00:01:16.640> improves<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
also save tilling which improves the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.420 
also save tilling which improves the
soil<00:01:17.479> fertility<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.290> cuts<00:01:18.619> down<00:01:18.830> on<00:01:19.040> runoff

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
soil fertility and cuts down on runoff

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.399 
soil fertility and cuts down on runoff
so<00:01:19.670> these<00:01:19.790> are<00:01:19.970> great<00:01:20.150> things<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.140> majority

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
so these are great things the majority

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.140 
so these are great things the majority
of<00:01:21.590> people<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.009> United<00:01:22.310> States<00:01:22.369> would<00:01:22.970> be

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
of people in the United States would be

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.570 
of people in the United States would be
surprised<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.869> learn<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.380> most<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
surprised to learn that most of the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.910 
surprised to learn that most of the
fresh<00:01:26.240> vegetables<00:01:26.840> are<00:01:27.020> processed<00:01:27.439> foods<00:01:27.680> we

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
fresh vegetables are processed foods we

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920 
fresh vegetables are processed foods we

component now in Europe this isn't the

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.420 
component now in Europe this isn't the
case<00:01:32.540> where<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.170> majority<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.680> people<00:01:34.070> really

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
case where the majority of people really

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.499 
case where the majority of people really
disdain<00:01:34.880> GM<00:01:35.750> foods<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> concerns<00:01:38.060> is

disdain GM foods one of the concerns is

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.990 
disdain GM foods one of the concerns is
that<00:01:38.540> these<00:01:39.340> particularly<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.430> terms<00:01:40.820> of

herbicide resistance though these hope
site<00:01:43.610> resistance<00:01:44.270> genes<00:01:44.630> will<00:01:44.869> escape<00:01:45.320> from

site resistance genes will escape from

site resistance genes will escape from
the<00:01:46.430> crops<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.299> enter<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.229> wild<00:01:48.740> plants<00:01:49.250> and

the crops and enter the wild plants and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.600 
the crops and enter the wild plants and
you<00:01:50.360> can<00:01:50.540> imagine<00:01:50.750> having<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.649> super<00:01:52.430> weeds

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
you can imagine having a super weeds

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.630 
you can imagine having a super weeds
that<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.509> now<00:01:54.200> not<00:01:54.590> killed<00:01:54.860> off<00:01:55.009> by<00:01:55.040> any<00:01:55.399> sort

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
potentially get around this is to put

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.530 
potentially get around this is to put

laboratory experiment or as you would

say laboratory experiment a pretty small
rate<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:15.930> transmission<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> authors<00:03:17.460> of

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490

rate of transmission so the authors of
the<00:03:17.670> paper<00:03:17.700> thought<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.540> fact<00:03:18.720> the

smaller<00:03:21.240> now<00:03:21.870> your<00:03:22.500> European<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.370> how<00:03:23.790> do<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
smaller now your European so how do you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.310 
smaller now your European so how do you
think<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.360> story<00:03:24.570> will<00:03:24.870> square<00:03:25.170> with

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
think this story will square with

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.410 
think this story will square with
Europeans<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:26.070> took<00:03:26.700> through<00:03:27.060> how<00:03:27.270> much

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
Europeans I took through how much

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.410
