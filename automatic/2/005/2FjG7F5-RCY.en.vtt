going you can move the ones around if

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.469 
going you can move the ones around if
that<00:04:54.780> makes<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.139> like<00:04:55.289> easier<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:56.520> know

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.140 

assemble<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:01.250> then<00:05:02.250> when<00:05:02.550> it's<00:05:02.699> all<00:05:02.880> dry

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
assemble and then when it's all dry

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.710 
assemble and then when it's all dry
we're<00:05:03.599> going<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:03.930> top<00:05:04.229> layer<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.560> Mod<00:05:04.800> Podge

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
we're going to a top layer of Mod Podge

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.890 
we're going to a top layer of Mod Podge
it's<00:05:06.720> kind<00:05:06.870> of<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.050> gluing<00:05:07.410> down<00:05:07.590> paper

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
it's kind of like gluing down paper

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.149 
it's kind of like gluing down paper
except<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.020> lot<00:05:10.139> harder<00:05:10.380> because<00:05:10.590> this<00:05:10.919> is<00:05:11.130> a

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
except a lot harder because this is a

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.659 
except a lot harder because this is a
life-or-death<00:05:11.550> situation<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.889> glue<00:05:14.490> it

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
life-or-death situation so to glue it

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.370 
life-or-death situation so to glue it
down<00:05:14.940> we<00:05:15.240> kind<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.510> worked<00:05:15.659> together<00:05:15.900> and

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
down we kind of worked together and

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.350 
down we kind of worked together and
Rachael<00:05:17.310> since<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.580> was<00:05:17.669> her<00:05:17.849> board<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.300> would

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
Rachael since it was her board I would

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.909 
Rachael since it was her board I would
glue<00:05:18.659> and<00:05:18.960> she<00:05:19.110> would<00:05:19.229> put<00:05:19.349> everything<00:05:19.590> down

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
glue and she would put everything down

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.260 
glue and she would put everything down
the<00:05:20.190> way<00:05:20.280> she<00:05:20.460> wanted<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:20.909> now<00:05:21.060> we're<00:05:21.240> just

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
the way she wanted it and now we're just

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.600 
the way she wanted it and now we're just
kind<00:05:21.389> of<00:05:21.599> filling<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.650> little<00:05:22.919> less<00:05:23.070> spaces

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
kind of filling the little less spaces

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.770 
kind of filling the little less spaces
by<00:05:23.789> cutting<00:05:24.949> cutting<00:05:25.949> pictures<00:05:26.130> oh<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:27.510> fits

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
by cutting cutting pictures oh it fits

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.020 
by cutting cutting pictures oh it fits
alright<00:05:28.770> perfect<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.370> now<00:05:29.550> we're<00:05:29.729> going<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.909> go
