00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.770
 Well it is function 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.799
 But in the central part of Chiba city 3891 meters of 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.599
 Like this 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.589
 It became a situation 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.039
 I am 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.220
 Pre 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.009
 This is a laugh 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.019
 Yes we control tomato high of this year Tunnel high 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.420
 Fly right 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.220
 Though the growth rate is too late due to too much shock 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.670
 I have removed the information 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.180
 I would like to think whether the total amount of damage will be good enough 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.440
 Not found 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.240
 Oh 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.250
 Right here remains unknown 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.910
 I just threw a round on the tunnel for the same amount 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.920
 Here 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.879
 It is blown off by the wind and rice 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.879
 All memory cards are full 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 This is no good This is not useful 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 It's normal, as always, 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.980
 Embedded in the ground to be Brian's Time mother 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 It is all but originally it is all 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.680
 However 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 It takes a form that is amazing 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 now 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.080
 Allegory to the seabed 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.090
 Moderately 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.730
 Although the wind is strong and it is a good body 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.030
 It is in a state of being sent to other companies and people 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.159
 irna 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.070
 Well again I think it's not only life 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.860
 Is not it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 I think that there is considerable damage but 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.530
 Do you think so? 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.520
 I do not know the following city at an interview 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 Well, I went down the line of the farm of the last day for such a day.
