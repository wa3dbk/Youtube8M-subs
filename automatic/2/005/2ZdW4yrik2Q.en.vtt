00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840

on to FIFA 12 it was just so much fun
and<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.590> thought<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.130> I've<00:01:32.220> done<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and I thought you know I've done it I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
and I thought you know I've done it I
think<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.060> every<00:01:33.390> single<00:01:33.630> FIFA<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> figured

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
think in every single FIFA so I figured

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
think in every single FIFA so I figured
it's<00:01:35.369> only<00:01:35.579> fair<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> theme<00:01:36.479> 14<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it's only fair that I do in theme 14 and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's only fair that I do in theme 14 and
you<00:01:37.290> guys<00:01:37.470> hopefully<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.430> come<00:01:39.030> along<00:01:39.210> this

because<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.320> all<00:02:46.470> started<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.100> Ultimate<00:02:47.550> Team

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
because you all started on Ultimate Team

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.450 
because you all started on Ultimate Team
but<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.910> can't<00:02:48.180> actually<00:02:48.740> sell<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.950> original

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.040 
but you can't actually sell the original
players<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.030> get<00:02:51.270> from<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.630> starting

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
players that you get from your starting

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.080 
players that you get from your starting
team<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.740> kinda<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.520> rely<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:53.820> these

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
team so you kinda have to rely on these

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.060

whether I should open up packs or not

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.270 
whether I should open up packs or not
but<00:05:08.780> then<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:09.200> was<00:05:09.440> like<00:05:09.590> right<00:05:09.770> well<00:05:09.950> let<00:05:10.100> me<00:05:10.130> go

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
but then I was like right well let me go

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.740 
but then I was like right well let me go
ahead<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.700> get<00:05:10.910> these<00:05:11.030> coin<00:05:11.360> boosts<00:05:11.600> and

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
ahead and get these coin boosts and

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.990 
ahead and get these coin boosts and
guess<00:05:12.140> what<00:05:12.500> they<00:05:13.310> aren't<00:05:13.610> there<00:05:13.790> because

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
guess what they aren't there because

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.970 
guess what they aren't there because
they<00:05:14.270> were<00:05:14.330> actually<00:05:14.480> taking<00:05:14.900> it<00:05:15.350> taken<00:05:15.740> out<00:05:15.950> I

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
they were actually taking it taken out I

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.560 
they were actually taking it taken out I
believe<00:05:16.130> because<00:05:16.610> there<00:05:17.000> was<00:05:17.120> some<00:05:17.300> sort<00:05:17.510> of

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
believe because there was some sort of

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.780 
believe because there was some sort of
glitch<00:05:17.810> or<00:05:18.020> something<00:05:18.440> that<00:05:18.590> EA<00:05:18.830> it<00:05:19.340> kind<00:05:19.640> of

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
glitch or something that EA it kind of

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.000 
glitch or something that EA it kind of
let<00:05:20.390> through<00:05:20.780> or<00:05:20.960> something<00:05:21.170> about<00:05:21.500> accident

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
let through or something about accident

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.180 
let through or something about accident
and<00:05:22.130> people<00:05:22.970> were<00:05:23.060> just<00:05:23.120> getting<00:05:23.570> ridiculous

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
and people were just getting ridiculous

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.230 
and people were just getting ridiculous
amount<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.250> coins<00:05:25.520> through<00:05:25.820> this<00:05:25.970> match

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
amount of coins through this match

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.420 
amount of coins through this match
glitch<00:05:26.630> shenanigans<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.950> was<00:05:28.070> just<00:05:28.310> an

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
glitch shenanigans and it was just an

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.250

out and that's another reason why I

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.590 
out and that's another reason why I
thinks<00:05:48.520> packs<00:05:49.520> could<00:05:49.790> come<00:05:49.940> in<00:05:50.060> nicely<00:05:50.270> just
