on ouch that's going to hurt okay so
flanked<00:01:32.729> rows<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> check

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
flanked rows I'm just going to check

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.170 
flanked rows I'm just going to check
that<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.590> frankly<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.700> move

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that this is all frankly and we can move

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
that this is all frankly and we can move
the<00:01:36.390> airplane<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:37.200> we're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> use

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the airplane good we're going to use

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
the airplane good we're going to use
this<00:01:38.400> trim<00:01:38.700> wheel<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> we're<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> put

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this trim wheel here we're going to put

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
this trim wheel here we're going to put
it<00:01:39.509> back<00:01:39.659> onto<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> takeoff<00:01:40.320> position<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it back onto the takeoff position so it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.440 
it back onto the takeoff position so it
basically<00:01:41.549> when<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.060> off<00:01:42.210> there's<00:01:42.390> no

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
basically when we take off there's no

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
basically when we take off there's no
pressure<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> controls<00:01:44.159> either

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
pressure on the on the controls either

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
pressure on the on the controls either
way<00:01:44.610> otherwise<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> could<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.990> pretty<00:01:46.200> bad

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
way otherwise that could be pretty bad

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.420 
way otherwise that could be pretty bad
okay<00:01:46.950> mixture

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
okay mixture

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.560 
okay mixture

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
Lutron Kemeny controls air off don't

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.179 
Lutron Kemeny controls air off don't
worry<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:51.720> them<00:01:51.899> plural<00:01:52.619> friction<00:01:53.009> that's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
worry about them plural friction that's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.730 
worry about them plural friction that's
this<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:53.670> golden<00:01:54.390> thing<00:01:54.570> here<00:01:54.750> basically

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
this little golden thing here basically

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.260 
this little golden thing here basically
all<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.219> does<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> tighten<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
all that does is that tighten to the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
all that does is that tighten to the
throttle<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.780> don't<00:01:57.930> inadvertently<00:01:58.110> push

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
throttle so you don't inadvertently push

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
throttle so you don't inadvertently push
it<00:01:58.799> forward<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.219> it<00:02:00.119> doesn't<00:02:00.420> automatically

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
it forward or it doesn't automatically

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
it forward or it doesn't automatically
go<00:02:00.990> forward<00:02:01.229> or<00:02:01.290> back<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.890> loosen<00:02:02.369> that's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
go forward or back so one loosen that's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.499 
go forward or back so one loosen that's
because<00:02:02.729> we're<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.090> doing<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.299> lot<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because we're going to be doing a lot of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.830 
because we're going to be doing a lot of
moving<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.469> take<00:02:05.130> off<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.520> taxi<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.719> we

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
moving as we take off and taxi so we

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
moving as we take off and taxi so we
aren't<00:02:06.960> loosen<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.380> Club<00:02:07.920> righty

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
aren't loosen that Club righty

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.619 
aren't loosen that Club righty
I<00:02:08.340> told<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.119> make<00:02:09.360> sure<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I told you about that so make sure that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.089 
I told you about that so make sure that
works<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.050> goes<00:02:10.200> into<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.440> that's<00:02:10.920> good

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
works that goes into that that's good

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.740 
works that goes into that that's good
alright<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.940> we're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.300> put<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.480> master

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
alright so we're going to put the master

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.770 
alright so we're going to put the master
switch<00:02:12.900> on<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
switch on there

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.160 
switch on there
there<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.380> now<00:02:14.709> everything<00:02:15.670> comes<00:02:15.880> alive

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
there it is now everything comes alive

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370 
there it is now everything comes alive
so<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.410> next<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:18.430> job<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.110> circuit<00:02:20.110> breakers

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so the next here job is circuit breakers

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.080 
so the next here job is circuit breakers
fuses<00:02:20.650> nothing<00:02:21.040> none<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:21.550> popped<00:02:21.880> out

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
fuses nothing none of these popped out

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.960 
fuses nothing none of these popped out
so<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:23.650> can<00:02:23.830> go<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> next<00:02:24.520> one<00:02:24.670> which<00:02:24.819> is

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so we can go on to the next one which is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.910 
so we can go on to the next one which is
prior<00:02:25.209> now<00:02:25.420> we've<00:02:25.840> already<00:02:26.170> been<00:02:26.380> flying<00:02:26.680> for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
prior now we've already been flying for

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.830 
prior now we've already been flying for
a<00:02:27.100> good<00:02:27.340> hour<00:02:27.490> or<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.270> don't<00:02:28.540> need<00:02:28.780> to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
a good hour or so so we don't need to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240 
a good hour or so so we don't need to
worry<00:02:29.050> about<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.290> primer<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.980> we're<00:02:30.069> going<00:02:30.160> to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
worry about the primer so we're going to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.420 
worry about the primer so we're going to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
known for my starting abilities so while

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.620 
known for my starting abilities so while
finding<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> right<00:02:50.500> key<00:02:50.739> actually<00:02:51.160> is

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
finding the right key actually is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.500 
finding the right key actually is
strange<00:02:52.630> enough<00:02:52.840> there's<00:02:53.050> actually<00:02:53.320> three

strange enough there's actually three
three<00:02:55.510> keys<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.050> thing<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.100> here<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:57.310> go

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
three keys in this thing and here we go

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.070 
three keys in this thing and here we go
we<00:02:57.519> found<00:02:57.640> them<00:02:57.820> alright<00:02:58.360> then<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.630> quick<00:02:58.900> or
