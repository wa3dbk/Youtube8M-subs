00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.439
 I want to improve 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.110
 a lot of things in life. 

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:04.200
 I would 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.886
 [cry] communicate 

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:06.876
 at the speed of light, 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.000
 play with sounds, 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.389
 to enter the images, 

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:10.000
 tell me 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.000
 or entertain me, 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.999
 as I want 

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:12.599
 But I would like 

00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:13.200
 that all that remains 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.880
 simple 

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:14.870
 to really enjoy it 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.545
 I could 

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:16.154
 please 

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:18.480
 wait ... 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.646
 But like 100,000 people 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.305
 at Orange, 

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:21.337
 I prefer to work there 

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:22.880
 every day 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.666
 for all of this to become 

00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:26.885
 a reality. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.223
 I would like everything to be faster, 

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:09.747
 everything is more fluid, 

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:11.280
 more ... everything is immediate 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
 No, I'm loose ... 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.958
 [voiceover] trust 

00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:15.880
 Okay 

00:01:17.262 --> 00:01:18.880
 uh ... what is it already? 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.902
 I could just wait, 

00:01:21.022 --> 00:01:22.318
 but like 100,000 people 

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:23.024
 at Orange, 

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:24.396
 I prefer to work there 

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:25.166
 every day 

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:26.433
 to make it concrete 

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.420
 and accessible to everyone 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.200
 concrete and accessible to everyone 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.399
 [voiceover] again 

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:33.099
 play with sounds 

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.989
 It's the concept I liked 

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:49.505
 I thought it was great 

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:50.469
 in the sense that it put forward 

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:51.365
 Orange employees 

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:53.422
 and I thought it was innovative. 

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:54.933
 We are in the best position 

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:56.115
 to talk about our companies 

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:57.274
 and I thought the idea was good 

00:01:57.394 --> 00:01:58.197
 We are happy to do it, 

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.227
 we are glad we were caught 

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:01.880
 we want to represent the box 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.564
 I am young enough in the company 

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:04.954
 so I wanted to invest myself thoroughly 

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:06.731
 There is a family side, 

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.878
 an attachment to the box 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:11.970
 who actually feels 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.207
 Orange is a company that is open 

00:02:14.327 --> 00:02:16.439
 and that's good because it helps 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.160
 see people from every horizon 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.591
 It allows me to unite 

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.070
 to unite people and that's a very good thing, 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.268
 Even if we are not real actors 

00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:25.040
 I think the messages 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.817
 we will certainly be able to pass them 

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:28.291
 as much as the real actors
