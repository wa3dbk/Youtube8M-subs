 How are you doing? I'm chef Carlos 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.090
 With my name we started a new carlo 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.739
 kitchen make a turkey christmas is 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.570
 complicated today the market what 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.370
 solve with us we can find 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.470
 ready payments that worry us then 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.239
 make a rich sauce or can we 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.250
 stores that are in season with a 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.250
 little apple here in possible change 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.340
 what I was telling you is that today in the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 market we can find already payments that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.239
 even the breast is cooked 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.710
 cooked and cut into portions 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.000
 Individuals find it in the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.560
 supermarkets and that is the option that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 let's eat to make this recipe in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.619
 that we are going to focus on doing the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.880
 sauce and for that always green apples 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 it inspired a little in the presence of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.869
 apple puree that looks good with the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.680
 payment but in this case we will occupy 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.680
 to make the sauce 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.010
 let's cut into not so small cubes 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.240
 because we want just as you feel that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.240
 he does not completely want currency 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.469
 we put the apple with a pan 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469
 hot 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.140
 we lower the fire 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.140
 we rest beautiful 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.120
 has as the Appalachians said 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.670
 with that is enough we add the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.670
 cherry 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.840
 look when it takes this golden color 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.090
 even everything is minute to add the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.410
 Cognac eye with this part that can be 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.790
 a bit dangerous because it has to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.120
 be careful not to do this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.120
 children 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.319
 add a little concentrated broth 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.319
 it can be chicken meat 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.570
 where the broths were added 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.570
 some water 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.330
 and to bind we are going to dissolve a little 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.440
 of cornstarch 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.440
 and enjoy it with love 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.470
 we just arrived over the sauce but 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.569
 before that and to finish they can 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.730
 add always remember some grass 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.550
 aromatic in this case I will put leaves 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.380
 of sage and now 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.680
 we would see the cornstarch we are ready 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.680
 heart 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.180
 we let it take a point and we put it 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.989
 about the payment I have this turkey breast 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 that comes nothing and everything I go 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.770
 to do but it is to take 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.770
 a little on the grid before serving 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.610
 we have the hot turkey what if I 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.890

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.330

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.330
 DVD of the largest pieces 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.090
 and to finish we're going to add the sauce 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.239
 and the sauce we add over 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.670
 and obviously you have to look for a table 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.780
