00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.549
 hello girls okay with you today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.160
 I'm attacking with another cook. 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.130
 I'm going to show you how to 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.580
 people do to reuse that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.439
 little leftover knows about lunch and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 of dinner and you do not know what else 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 do with it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 so every time we buy one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 Serving chicken at home is always left over and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.450
 sometimes sometimes I can noodles sometimes 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.500
 of thorn and tapioca where I do 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.200
 Pizza 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 I always have a lot of fashion for him and what 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 people are going to do with this chicken today is the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.719
 chicken gratin with creamed corn're 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 so we're going to need a can 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.809
 maize bt tool here was already 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 Sunday this was a pack with 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.510
 200 grams there you see the amount 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.000
 Are you going to miss a box of 200? 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 grams of cream and the brand of your 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 preference 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 here the salt is the chicken of course you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.040
 put the amount you had 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.310
 there is plenty left for you 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.430
 here I'm going to take off all the skin and bones 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 chicken and the remaining meat I go 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.689
 discuss the ok 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.759
 There we have to make the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.119
 People are going to need braised chicken 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.820
 so I have here a syrup tablet 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.310
 and those daily folders 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 We'll need cheese too. 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.829
 grated parmesan and a cheese to put 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.780

 milk 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.780
 this moment here because the grated cheese 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.119
 is salty but is at the discretion of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.399
