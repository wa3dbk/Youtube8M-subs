00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.029
 the new season will be so different 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.410
 it is not so an experience 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.750
 incredible 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 my son was born in Hawaii he had a 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.029
 It's like seeing Brazil because I 've already been to 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.460
 hidden port that was the first 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 destination already went to portugal to the south 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.919
 to the river 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.689
 brat're well traveled extensively is a 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.999
 New experience for us is super 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.529
 difficult as for me to bia with dad and 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.529
 Mother travels with a child, right? 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.630
 when the channel went pro eth ethical 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.610
 need to defend the flag of the 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.770
 new sport I want cade football 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.020
 ambassadors of the sport 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.230
 But now I think it's already 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.790
 nationally known and I can 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.530
 go back a little to my roots 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.590
 that was always the love of the waves 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.040
 big is now so addicted to sup 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.040
 also 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.030
 will not have a 98 and I'm ugly some 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.620
 more so from 8 to 12 feet and I felt that 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.420
 if I wanted to get bigger waves 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.190
 That I had to make a board. 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.130
 This is the way most people use it. 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.920
 little clipboard and pick up I do not know either 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.470
 the honda that is but in my case I think 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 It would be better to make a bigger board 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.440
 of 98 so I did a 10 and 6 congress 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 so much heavier a good board 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.509
 But it's specific to work to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 Let's go, I do not know if I'm going to continue. 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.080
 on top of the new board arrive at the base 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 Wave but that was up there or 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 in relation to the recordings was very cool 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.600
 because we were lucky to catch a sun 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.140
 great harbor hidden in the eight to twelve 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 stones for a week and people 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.230
 it was fortunate that even windy thing 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.940
 who had never heard of anyone 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.760
 had sailed in hidden harbor 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.330
 getting decat there too and I did 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.330
 ride up 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.010
 NazarÃ© was incredible so was not the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.340
 Our I once saw in my life was 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.010
 giant is suffering with the team and my 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 friend who lives in Portugal molds roads 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 of my life I got about four five 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.050
 angry waves 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.640
 only that I was not even expecting it to be 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.910
 so great of the south is a plank of 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.770
 towers without lead and without 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.780
 What if I did not believe the first? 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.640
 nor did a brave bull appear to the board if 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.800
 it was a crazy survival thing 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.720
 total so as not to fall on the wave 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.430
 she does not have the performance she has 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.070
 classes for example is a wave 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 You can pick up a tube from the various 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.430
 ripped and 100 in the channel that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.380
 one of them is not 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.000
 there is life or death right now it is here 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.720
 Does it matter that God is greater? 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.730
 experience of your life and rescue everything 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.100
 which involves in front of the stones 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.630
 really the most serious thing was the most 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.630
 radical I 've ever caught 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.590
 and then it was really cool because in 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.540
 supertubos where wt is and a poet who 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.090
 said not to go in there because she 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.150
 The locals can borges will kill you right. 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.209
 and I got there the krall book to look at 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 the waves or strong side winds 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.040
 there was no one sailing I got up 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.010
 That's the way it was in the morning for the first time. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.170
 series that sees the perfect so I saw that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.360
 motoboys to take on the head already saw in 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.660
 pop wave a tube of kite a helmet on the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.580
 head filming time the expression of the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.550
 cases thus looking at me the past one 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.650
 pipe with the line cutting the olic then 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.239
 It was such a thing, too, so you know. 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.420
 until gaining respect from the new cars 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.000
 sites began to shout because 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.560
 I ended up becoming friends with guys and such 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.269
 like the son on the beach so after 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.040
 these sessions are also incredible then 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.040
 This new phase is very happy 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.319
 and I 'm having a feedback on the streets 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.329
 very cool of programs and it's very 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.950
 Nice to see that people like your 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.739
 work on this one thing that does not have 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.420
 price and even surprised me sometimes is that 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.099
 It's so natural because I 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.790
 I graduated in journalism and I really like 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.909
 record camera to do i love 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.409
 catch one of the big ones to decat make climb 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.000
 so I'm blessed by God of power 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.489
 work with what I love right? 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.949
 and it's really cool to see that all this my 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.720
 love transmitted at work has 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.720
 pleased to people who are priceless
