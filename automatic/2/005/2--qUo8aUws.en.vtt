00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.330
 Well, I'm going to explain how 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:12.440
 matches the bluetooth with the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.440
 radio in this shield 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 I hope that then it is clear well 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.330
 so then to drive you have to have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 the car on 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.010
 I have an iphone here not long ago 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.770
 there is not much light 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.650
 his iphone 5 is from my wife who is not 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.520
 paired with him with the car 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.340
 and the first thing is to turn on the module 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.910
 bluetooth on it 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.250
 on the iphone to turn on the bluetooth 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.940
 and we leave it on this screen 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 here 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 this already seems to be looking for money 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.429
 there and now I come here the maximum you 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.280
 We put here where it says phone 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.280
 with my telephone 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 configuration 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.530
 no lies 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 the phone 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.010
 and we look here in menu where it says 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.620
 bluetooth 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.190
 here it seems user visibility of other 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.880
 things 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.660
 invisibility we receive that is visible 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.660
 activity and the level is active 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.659
 and here we put add user and it appears 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.069
 then looking for phones and here in the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.780
 iphone also appears search 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.200
 devices let's hope to see yes that 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 appear 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.460
 well, it's taking longer than 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.460
 I expected 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.270
 OK so 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.570
 here they appear as they see 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.630
 several computers that has detected the 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.220
 car bluetooth 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.730

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.380

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.680

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.150
 and here what comes here appears in the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.150
 feet 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.640
 2. 3. 4 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.640
 and chance 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.570
 connecting connected 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.870
 a new mobile has been detected even 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.819
 here the radio also shows create 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.879

 and iphone user claudia we can ok 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.250
 and the user is created 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.380
 here not only connects the term but 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.240
 also connect to the player 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.620
 and they remain as we are discounted and appears 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.030
 now the agenda of the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.010
 phone appears the battery of 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.780
 bluetooth and the last incognito here the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.040
 from here is the player put 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.719
 then now 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.140
 well it is already rigged one can receive 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.420
 calls from the phone over the radio 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.069
 of the car 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.069
 if they are fixed here she appears 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.220
 appears the agenda appear we all have 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.500
 that be 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.870
 they are stored in the cell phone 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.660
 perfect update and if we want to put 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.890
 music that was the other concern that already 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.720
 there was 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.410
 then of simple does not put here the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 player 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.750
 and we can any song I do not know 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.139
 for that cell phone does not have many 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.200
 songs 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.570
 any bright sun emits 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.970
 if they realize this and here appears 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.150
 with the two iphone options will be the 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.930
 speaker and skoda go broom go let's go 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.930
 we turn it on to the radio 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.730
 it's on average radio 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.180
 let's see again the autonomy and scary 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.180
 Appear 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.960
 you know you can not 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.489
 they are not equipped 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.680
 I already had to move here in action and here 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.449
 this nation appears audio time of 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.449
 position friends average audio 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.840
 ok I hope 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.150
 Well, that's the way it's simple, I hope that 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.169
 they work for a little bit delayed 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.070
 but hopefully 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.850
 can apply 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.850
 Thank you
