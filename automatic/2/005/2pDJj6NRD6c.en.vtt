00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.859
 the next way to make fire specifically 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.670
 for smokers suppose such 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
 the situation 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.320
 you run out of gas lighters fire 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 dilute can be removed the cream did not stay 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 no gas does not touch happiness lighters 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.050
 I have such a special thing too 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.089
 cream already daws well, take the red 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 the smoker just we have a lighter up 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.710
 passed away take a cigarette 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 so first you need to prepare in advance 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:56.690
 kindling our neutrals like in any 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.690
 the other case we turn off is not dead 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:09.080
 I still found a little fluff 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.080
 here is the middle of it but he is such a thing 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.440
 in advance 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 next we need need some work 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.640
 flammable 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.760
 for this we can shave with you and on 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 shave for example our t-shirt if she 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.890
 eats bypassed material for that just 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:37.920
 such movements anywhere t-shirts 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.070
 you can rub and see it turns out 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.710
 I let a bard down like that or 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050
 called here is the thing I already 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.850
 I collected that is, you can shave 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.430
 football is we going to kindle just like that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.020
 Kindle it will be inconvenient take 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.360
 cigarettes break me off part of us 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.950
 still useful smoke tobacco shake out 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.950
 we only need papers 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.980
 yielding tobacco you can pour it nest 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.640
 too will most likely be 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.290
 cage will help gorenje 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.459
 what we got on t-shirts 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.380
 I put this snowstorm 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.180
 all the cliff tobacco we need 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.010
 just roughly a piece of paper if of course 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.040
 there is some other nearby 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.950
 a piece of paper then a newspaper for example 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.950
 gareta just vinegar and 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.970
 nearly 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.360
 blow neatly 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.360
 piece of paper 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.960
 and snowstorm that blues t-shirts 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.800
 wrapping up a piece of paper is very neat 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.800
 doing 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.129
 itâ€™s even as if we had a tank 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.999
 wrapped up 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:20.480
 tube we twist our tube such 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:20.480
 do a pipe and inside we have parga 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:29.569
 now take the lighter business without gas and 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.569
 directing 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.590
 all things will be pressure cheater 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.030
 can see that paper is cigarette 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.480
 seizes very well from the slightest 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.220
 sparks 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:54.400
 starts to fester here is this adhesive 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.420
 Peleg we put the nest and begin 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.420
 neatly break 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.330
 video 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.340
 is burning 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.710
 there were fire 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:40.370
 poems we ourselves will get a sparkle ember 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.560
 further in the same way any way 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:52.280
