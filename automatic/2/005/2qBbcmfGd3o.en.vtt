00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.100
 reversible to subscribers and to those who 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.710
 looked at my channel today will be 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.700
 do through a short video about how i 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.309
 I go stand and and what to do to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 learn to walk in a rack actually 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 all these approaches are my personal 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.380
 inference because they taught to walk 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.539
 me in the line about childhood and the screen 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.189
 childhood is not well remembered 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 Apparently my talent is the birth of a thing 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.320
 because you definitely worth th and I stand 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.380
 I do not know how long but I hope that the video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.260
 will be interesting so stay with 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.969
 me and unlike this twine here 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.379
 there will be a lot of chatter 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.890
 so as not to do on the subject go and so on 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.050
 my opinion is the most important thing that is necessary 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 reason on 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.070
 whether you want to stand in a stand 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.629
 and racks 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.620
 these are his strong shoulders until the shoulder blades and 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.449
 back 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:09.460
 In this case, 0 and I do not need petitions 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.400
 and the end only hinders us, but I have 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.310
 minimize foot foot action is our 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.040
 Kaido imbalance empty racks but when 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.399
 we walk stoker it is very good 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 stewards and a little further you will understand about 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:30.410
 than i say and to strengthen myself 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.429
 command the blades back spin i mean me 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:39.039
 it seems it would be good to do any 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.110
 exercise for these muscle groups what is it 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.610
 hypertension just smiles on the floor 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.470
 any pull-ups in the slope 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.700
 pushups is a wide arm setting 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.030
 because the load goes to the shoulder 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.569
 bone and on the shoulder blades and I really like 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.960
 this exercise is also this you are standing in 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:07.460
 the rack should not forget about the error this 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.069
 it's just an indispensable assistant 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.410
 when from that rack I will always be like that 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.350
 just torture and fingers slightly under whom they 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.360
 and that gaytsami balancers and I still I 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.500
 I am trying to find a balance in Tokyo 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.420
 store get up and field i want to become and yet 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.840
 very important is when you stand in a rack 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.950
 you try to wall as far as you can 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.739
 up then there are two many people when 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.830
 the racks begin they have a very correct 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.620
 correct housing position 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 body position is like this 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.410
 ate her hands and feet all all all all all 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.160
 stretched to the maximum 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.760
 stretched but many people don't 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.260
 it becomes rack possible because 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.130
 experience is possible and for weak muscular 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 back and shoulders and they love stomping 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.280
 stand here like you never 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.800
 learn to walk and stand grandchildren and eat 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.560
 actually the difference is put up so here 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.720
 or expose like that is the second 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.590
 option is correct that is necessary 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.420
 pull out 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.250
 whole body and very cool pull out 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.120
 exactly got it because if you 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.830
 thread lover gravity will carry you 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.560
 down it's like a story 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.870
 dalton wedge for a pigtail to pull out 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.020
 up so here 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.790
 drawing on pascal design like this 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:56.160
 here and keep pulling my shoulders 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.220
 just physically rises here 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.340
 faith and do not let fall issued such 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.790
 heavy load itself is all that 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.260
 have pump pump these muscles and to 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.810
 learn to walk and stand 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.690
 need to at least learn how to stand 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.019
 in rack and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.180
 and probably the easiest easiest 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.760
 the most common exercise is poison 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.820
 is learn to put up the rack 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.270
 near the wall it is absolutely not scary and 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.370
 exercise, and most importantly the main direct rays 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.480
 if you throw up your hands tunak all 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.899
 put his head here and so I will 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.429
 prepare your own 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:43.809
 wall i would i will show so stand 

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:45.729
 8 walls 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:48.579
 how to stand that is not worth it 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.579
 lean on the wall not head 

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.269
 do not be done under the brick go to 

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.119
 pictures 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:59.729
 this with all sorts of sports girls 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:05:01.320
 it looks very strong but it is a pose 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.420
 exclusively for 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.610
 if the sport still has a muscle sport and 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.890
 so i switch to this mode 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.050
 voiceover and proper rack 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.720
 I see nothing but socks 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.050
 touch the wall when you stand 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.600
 You can be more confident to walk on by 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.210
 roll over from hand to hand and 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.550
 it helps a lot when you stand when 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.750
 collect noticed by the way does not hurt and 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.210
 learn how to get down from a building site 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.550
 something will not be the first way is like 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.120
 100 sheet rack so went down with them 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.400
 the second way is to turn around in the rack 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.970
 and with this we take it off when you fall 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.720
 backwards 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.940
 the third way so much in k lesson too everything 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.980
 simply 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.790
 Well, actually we came to us on 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.780
 glands 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.630
 This theory as want stand and proper 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.140
 I will show how I walk the racks I hope that 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.450
 you get from the first time so 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.360
 when you go out with the main thing to save 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.140
 that's what I'm showing 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.190
 extended position 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.490
 near the extended position of the body 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.140
 so that I am drawn even stronger 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.830
 stretched socks but it is so necessary 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.700
 habit 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.350
 and very important is what I understood in 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.930
 virgin what helps me now 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:34.860
 always walk in any circumstances 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:38.580
 very very long time 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.250
 it is worth you feet a little to fill up 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.160
 who is straightening where are you going that is 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:48.600
 legs are yours and 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:53.250
 it's really very, very strong 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.250
 helps you walk and 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.030
 but 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:22.870
 actually all wear what you like 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:28.830
 where you will be confident and fast 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.830
 come here all for a long time
