00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.350
 [Music] 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.350
 It is always reliable devil 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.590
 I think the luismi missions are almost there 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.530

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.760
 killing that bitch 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 and it does not end 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.160
 well they follow me 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.660
 the police dance I think we have 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 to distribute blocks or something 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.240

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.240
 maicon 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.739
 we have to distribute warren 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.490
 a four-door car and you were 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.709
 the one chosen by the gods 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.709
 [Music] 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.100
 super super spin 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.720
 super super parking 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.960
 and they only give us 4 minutes 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.140
 guardian splitters 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 It works well 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.500
 and its people no longer 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.030
 good first to leave these 2 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.010
 Oh no 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.200
 today is not my lucky day, believe me 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 but that are open 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.160
 finally something faster 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 well there is a rope here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.739
 you go and age 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.060
 and then there is another one here 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.360
 if I was looking for you already in turn 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.230
 when I take 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.230

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.569
 and let's go let's go let's go 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.849
 I do not have all the fucking night in the game 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 room about nine o'clock in the morning 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.760
 he had nothing to do and that the three and 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.879
 then I answered myself why 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.879
 do not 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.569
 and here is 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.529
 to channel 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.529
 [Music] 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.630
 but we are missing three guards 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.270
 [Music] 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.660
 well according to the radar of the 44th century is 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.660

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.719
 and you go and you took 4 thousandths of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.719
 seconds 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.230

 [Music] 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.340
 well at least the car turns over which is 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.810
 the important thing and a strange question is 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.810
 that makes a slut in the dumpster 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.990
 or something like that 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.790
 this world is so strange sometimes 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.360

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.620
 there is also the devil still 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.630
 has subliminal messages the devil 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.630
 to learn 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.260
 we're almost there, we're almost there 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.900
 we have 48 seconds 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.970
 to the distribution of guards ended 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.790
 today in that music 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.789

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.789

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.210

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.210
 driving school 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.620

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.479
 the first three years are free 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.880
 in fact the course lasts 40 minutes 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:37.190
 but anyway, it happens to me 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.710
 [Music] 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.710
