 in this video tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.280
 download and install what would be the gta 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.290
 chinatown wars for pc 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.660
 with sound all ok 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.660
 also this video I did it for 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.700
 my 400 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.700
 directors this 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.980
 Let's see 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.840
 this simile in 404 subscribers now 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.330
 same and good I ask you to subscribe 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.260
 to my channel if they already liked some channels 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.260
 That I have here 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.659
 we make the following ones that will be the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.149
 installation 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.960
 to download this file made that 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 just weigh 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.920
 that only weighs 616 megabytes 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.150
 as you see it is very light 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.150
 the game ok 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.870
 to download them they will have to go to 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 half 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 right now I have not uploaded it because 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.410
 just start the video or not 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.400
 but as soon as I finish I'll upload it 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.420
 I would start 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.420
 and be in link 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.509
 once they have downloaded it they will 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.050
 leave a file like this in a file 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050
 iso 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.880
 wars 025 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.510
 to install it they should burn it or 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.780
 mount them with a program called 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.780
 damon tour 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.849
 they create you 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.220
 a virtual disk so you can ride 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.220
 his images did cc.oo 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.819
 and in this case I will not burn it because I do not 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.599
 I have silvio 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.599
 good time 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.220
 as I said no I do not have time like that 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.340
 to open the wine tools light 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.020
 if you want to download this program I 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.230
 I'm going to leave you a link so you can 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.230
 download and a link uploaded by me 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.069
 I had already assembled it here but now 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.240
 same as 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.820
 it will not dismantle ok 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.820
 so they can see the process 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.970
 if you are dismounted forgiveness 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.689
 to mount it anyway it serves 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.689
 this high mac has added image 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.170
 this window will open and select 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.140
 the picture made ok of the game they take care 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.280
 this was 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.280
 in one click 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.030
 we get the same box that puts us 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.980
 every time we insert a disk 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.110
 automatic playback once 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.110
 Well, you will give him here 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.900
 installation of a rare musiquita 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 to open this window 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.160
 warsh let me tell you 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.750
 a disadvantage of this game 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.020
 is that he does not put it on your screen 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.990
 complete this or that is nothing else puts you 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.220
 A) Yes 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.410
 is the attempt to be a screen 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.650
 ok screen that's one of the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.650
 disadvantages 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.249
 we do the installation they give here 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.379
 something different install 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.669
 If you want to see other contributions of this 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.669
 baby boy and global 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.330
 We will give you to install 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.320
 window 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.140
 like the next 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.790
 this is normal that they put you does not respond 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.790
 so leave it until you 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.010
 will open this small screen 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.510
 Welcome to the gta station 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.510
 chinatown wars ok we will give you next 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.510
 I agree 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.380
 here will be the address is going to 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.380
 install the getafe 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.110
 good if I would leave it 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.860
 be next 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.360
 or it's heavy 257 already installed that weighs me down 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.180
 half equipment bytes 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.550
 The next 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.500
 in case you want to create a shortcut 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.570
 of the game on the desk that I 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.570
 and finally they give him to install 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.740
 about the video 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.190
 as you see here, the installation has finished 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.420
 it did not even last three minutes it lasted like 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.300
 one and a half 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:18.260
 because it weighs very little that they least give 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:21.110
 finalize and acquire mixed saw 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:26.140
 and how that has created us an access 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.140
 direct of the game on the desk 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.360
 I was telling you now to play it in a double 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.810
 click but I tell them that they are going to put 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.810
 well OK 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.180
 and well I do not put it because of qantas 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.530
 no longer manages to record good if it achieved 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.530
 but it goes to 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.340
 I do not like the video tutorial so far 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.340
 I hope that 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.050
 especially this good guy not so much 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.500
 I also went through no 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.540
 for my facebook I will leave them in the 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.169
 video description 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.009
 my name is 05 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.009
 good day 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.169
 now yes to the egg
