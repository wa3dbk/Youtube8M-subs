developed memory cancer except those

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.490 
developed memory cancer except those
given<00:01:20.790> coconut<00:01:21.390> oil<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.870> researchers

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
given coconut oil and the researchers

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.110 
stated you know they looked you know
dissected<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> tissues<00:01:26.160> and<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.060> they

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
dissected the tissues and look and they

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.300 
dissected the tissues and look and they
said<00:01:27.300> they<00:01:27.420> couldn't<00:01:27.690> find<00:01:28.020> any<00:01:28.380> evidence<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
said they couldn't find any evidence of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.510 
said they couldn't find any evidence of
cancer<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.960> coconut<00:01:31.620> oil<00:01:31.770> fed<00:01:32.190> animals

even<00:01:33.060> though<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.960> chemicals<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.010> they<00:01:35.160> gave

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
even though the chemicals that they gave

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.080 
even though the chemicals that they gave
to<00:01:35.550> him<00:01:36.000> were<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.570> potent<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:38.400> another<00:01:38.730> study

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

with<00:01:39.300> skin<00:01:39.660> cancer<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.470> similar<00:01:40.950> thing<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
with skin cancer a very similar thing is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
with skin cancer a very similar thing is
they<00:01:42.060> applied<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.810> cancer-causing<00:01:43.620> chemicals

on the skin of animals and within weeks
a<00:01:47.100> tumor<00:01:47.610> started<00:01:48.030> develop<00:01:48.570> however<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.680> they

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
a tumor started develop however if they

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
a tumor started develop however if they
used<00:01:50.160> coconut<00:01:50.610> oil<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.240> addition<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.470> on

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
used coconut oil in addition you know on

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.880 
used coconut oil in addition you know on
earth<00:01:52.740> no<00:01:53.730> cancer<00:01:54.480> develops<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.230> coconut<00:01:55.770> oil

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
earth no cancer develops so coconut oil

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.460 
earth no cancer develops so coconut oil
has<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.610> prominent<00:01:57.470> anti-cancer

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
has very prominent anti-cancer

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.480

properties<00:01:59.120> well<00:02:00.120> from<00:02:00.270> melanoma<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.470> mean<00:02:01.830> you

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
properties well from melanoma I mean you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.010 
properties well from melanoma I mean you
would<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.790> put<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.120> on<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.360> skin<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
would just put it on your skin it to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.570 
would just put it on your skin it to
protect<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.440> son<00:02:04.980> right<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.430> I've

basically thanks today a lot of people
are<00:02:14.270> talking<00:02:14.510> about<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.170> thyroid<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.980> that's

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
are talking about the thyroid and that's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.780 
are talking about the thyroid and that's
being<00:02:16.790> attributed<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.420> weight<00:02:18.170> problems<00:02:18.830> what

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
being attributed to weight problems what

effect does the coconut will have on the
thyroid<00:02:22.760> well<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.690> know<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.990> thyroid

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
thyroid well as you know the thyroid

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.920 
thyroid well as you know the thyroid
controls<00:02:25.070> our<00:02:25.430> metabolism<00:02:26.360> mm-hmm<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
controls our metabolism mm-hmm and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.130 
controls our metabolism mm-hmm and
coconut<00:02:27.830> oil<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.820> medium<00:02:29.120> chain<00:02:29.150> fatty<00:02:29.390> acids

coconut oil the medium chain fatty acids

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.160 
coconut oil the medium chain fatty acids
that<00:02:30.230> make<00:02:30.380> up<00:02:30.710> coconut<00:02:31.310> oil<00:02:31.610> are<00:02:32.170> processed

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
that make up coconut oil are processed

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.920 
that make up coconut oil are processed
in<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.770> liver<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.610> when<00:02:35.180> they<00:02:35.300> do<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:35.900> they

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
in the liver and when they do so they

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.580 
in the liver and when they do so they
boost<00:02:36.890> metabolism<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> metabolism<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
boost metabolism so metabolism in the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.180 
boost metabolism so metabolism in the
body<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.250> given<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.850> lift<00:02:41.270> which<00:02:41.720> gives<00:02:42.260> aid<00:02:42.710> to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
body is given a lift which gives aid to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.760 
body is given a lift which gives aid to
the<00:02:43.340> thyroid<00:02:43.670> gland<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:44.540> many<00:02:44.750> people<00:02:45.290> we

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the thyroid gland and many people we

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.310 
the thyroid gland and many people we
have<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> sudden<00:02:46.400> sluggish<00:02:47.000> thyroid<00:02:47.600> this

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
have a sudden sluggish thyroid this

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.890 
have a sudden sluggish thyroid this
boost<00:02:49.070> actually<00:02:49.820> kind<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.060> kickstart<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
boost actually kind of kickstart the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.950 
boost actually kind of kickstart the
thyroid<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.980> working<00:02:52.250> more<00:02:52.960> normally

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
thyroid and get it working more normally

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.900 
thyroid and get it working more normally
and<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.410> lots<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.860> people<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.340> low<00:02:55.580> thyroid

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
and so lots of people with low thyroid

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.500 
and so lots of people with low thyroid
problems<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:57.110> benefit<00:02:57.860> by<00:02:58.490> adding<00:02:58.970> coconut

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
problems can benefit by adding coconut

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.080 
problems can benefit by adding coconut
