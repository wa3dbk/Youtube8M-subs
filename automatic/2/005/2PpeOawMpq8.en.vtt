it<00:02:56.480> was<00:02:56.630> just<00:02:56.870> unlucky<00:02:57.080> then<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.220> ninth

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
right back that's a great block because

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.740 
right back that's a great block because
if<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.120> would<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.390> got<00:03:02.480> through<00:03:02.660> it
