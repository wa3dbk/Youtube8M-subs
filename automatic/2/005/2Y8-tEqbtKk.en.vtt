00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
with it they go up and then everyone

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.350 
with it they go up and then everyone
just<00:01:22.799> looks<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
will last but let's talk about the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.749 
will last but let's talk about the
potions<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:35.009> fixed<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
potions they they fixed a lot with the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.280 
potions they they fixed a lot with the
potions<00:01:36.150> again<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> combat<00:01:37.079> update

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
potions again this is the combat update

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.069 
potions again this is the combat update
and<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.280> thing<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.610> added<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.600> genius

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and the thing they added is it's genius

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.980 
and the thing they added is it's genius
because<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.950> makes<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> much<00:01:42.030> easier<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.689> see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
because it makes it much easier to see

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
because it makes it much easier to see
now<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.799> you've<00:01:43.950> ever<00:01:44.130> played<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
now I know if you've ever played like a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
now I know if you've ever played like a
hundred<00:01:44.909> games<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.479> you've<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.170> took<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
hundred games or you've just took a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.160 
hundred games or you've just took a
potion<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.979> general<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.210> never<00:01:48.509> necessarily

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
potion in general you never necessarily

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.499 
potion in general you never necessarily
know<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.360> it's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
know the time of you know when it's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
know the time of you know when it's
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.899> run<00:01:52.079> out<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:53.579> effect<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> has

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
going to run out or what effect it has

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.120 
going to run out or what effect it has
on<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:54.899> long<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> effect<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
on you how long the effect is going to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
on you how long the effect is going to
last<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.390> fix<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> where<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
last but they fix it to where it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.260 
last but they fix it to where it
actually<00:01:58.380> shows<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.549> screen<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.180> if

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually shows on the screen now so if

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
actually shows on the screen now so if
you<00:02:00.360> look<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> top<00:02:00.719> right<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:02.040> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you look in the top right you can see so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
you look in the top right you can see so
items<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> left<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> run<00:02:04.560> out

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
items to the left are going to run out

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.380 
items to the left are going to run out
quicker

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
quicker

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.020 
quicker
and<00:02:05.480> also<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.680> believe<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.190> good<00:02:07.430> items<00:02:07.640> are

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and also I believe the good items are

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.880 
and also I believe the good items are
going<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.240> be<00:02:08.330> like<00:02:08.570> on<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.990> top<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.740> have

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
going to be like on the top so you have

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
going to be like on the top so you have
regeneration<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.670> top<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.360> bad<00:02:11.600> items

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
regeneration on the top the bad items

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.540 
regeneration on the top the bad items
are<00:02:12.260> pretty<00:02:12.470> much<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.950> bottom<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.280> think<00:02:13.460> to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
are pretty much on the bottom I think to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.310 
are pretty much on the bottom I think to
the<00:02:13.640> right<00:02:13.850> or<00:02:14.030> what<00:02:14.180> not<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.810> thought<00:02:15.170> that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
the right or what not but I thought that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.870 
the right or what not but I thought that
was<00:02:15.470> pretty<00:02:15.650> cool<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.520> they'll<00:02:16.640> start

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
was pretty cool and they'll start

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.580 
was pretty cool and they'll start
flashing<00:02:17.180> once<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.810> about<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.140> run<00:02:18.320> out<00:02:18.470> but

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
flashing once it's about to run out but

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.080 
flashing once it's about to run out but
that's<00:02:18.770> pretty<00:02:18.890> much<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:19.310> today's<00:02:19.640> video

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
that's pretty much it for today's video

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's pretty much it for today's video
