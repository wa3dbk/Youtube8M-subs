00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
looks like let me show you it looks like

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
looks like let me show you it looks like
real<00:01:20.369> quick

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
real quick

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
real quick
that's<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> cradle<00:01:22.289> up<00:01:22.499> for<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.219> home<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:25.189> if

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that's the cradle up for the home and if

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.539 
that's the cradle up for the home and if
we<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.490> pop<00:01:26.969> that<00:01:27.149> back<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:29.369> should

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we can pop that back on there it should

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.359 
we can pop that back on there it should
come<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> minute<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> go

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.989 

alright<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.619> cradle<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> Onyx<00:01:38.819> is

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
alright so the cradle for the Onyx is

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.289 
alright so the cradle for the Onyx is
more<00:01:39.780> compact<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.069> older<00:01:41.490> radios

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
more compact than from the older radios

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
more compact than from the older radios
like<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.929> you<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.399> sky<00:01:44.399> phi2<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:46.649> cradle

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
like if you have a sky phi2 that cradle

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.230 
like if you have a sky phi2 that cradle
is<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.249> lot<00:01:47.399> bigger<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.969> it's<00:01:48.119> not

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
is a lot bigger and so it's not

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
is a lot bigger and so it's not
compatible<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.229> newer<00:01:49.499> radios<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
compatible with these newer radios but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
compatible with these newer radios but
the<00:01:50.670> nice<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.329> cradles<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> lot

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the nice thing is the cradles are a lot

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.779 
the nice thing is the cradles are a lot
smaller<00:01:52.319> than<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.859> original<00:01:53.630> XM<00:01:54.630> radios<00:01:55.259> were

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
smaller than the original XM radios were

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.599 
smaller than the original XM radios were
so<00:01:56.789> it's<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> nice<00:01:57.329> design<00:01:57.569> here<00:01:58.399> right<00:01:59.399> here

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
so it's a nice design here right here

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.219 
so it's a nice design here right here
you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.969> screen<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.659> blue<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.109> if

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you have the screen it's in blue but if

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.639 
you have the screen it's in blue but if
we<00:02:01.319> go<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.649> menu<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.959> go<00:02:04.109> down<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.529> we

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
we go to the menu we can go down and we

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.949 
we go to the menu we can go down and we
can<00:02:04.799> actually<00:02:04.979> change<00:02:05.549> color<00:02:06.240> themes<00:02:06.630> which

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
can actually change color themes which

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.059 
can actually change color themes which
is<00:02:07.139> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.499> nice<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> teal

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
is kind of nice so you can make a teal

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.190 
is kind of nice so you can make a teal
or<00:02:11.700> yellow<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.930> amber<00:02:13.830> or<00:02:14.490> red<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.569> we<00:02:16.049> might

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
or yellow or amber or red and we might

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.420 
or yellow or amber or red and we might
select<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:18.470> hit<00:02:19.470> menu<00:02:19.739> again<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.310> go

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
select that and hit menu again to go

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.200 
select that and hit menu again to go
back<00:02:20.459> so

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
back so

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.780 
back so

cradles for the home and for the car so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.940 
cradles for the home and for the car so
you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.210> move<00:03:36.480> your<00:03:36.540> radio<00:03:37.020> from<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.740> home

to your car and the reason you want to
do<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> course<00:03:40.800> there's<00:03:41.190> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
do that is because of course there's a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.850 
do that is because of course there's a
subscription<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.060> every<00:03:42.270> radio<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.590> saves

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
subscription for every radio so it saves

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.430 
subscription for every radio so it saves
you<00:03:44.270> part<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.450> monthly<00:03:45.840> fee<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.260> don't

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
you part of the monthly fee so you don't

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.410 
you part of the monthly fee so you don't
have<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.620> get<00:03:46.740> an<00:03:46.860> extra<00:03:47.130> radio<00:03:47.490> if<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.060> want

feature but this radio does not have

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.529 
feature but this radio does not have
that<00:04:43.229> also<00:04:44.189> this<00:04:44.370> radio<00:04:44.639> only<00:04:44.849> has<00:04:45.150> ten

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
that also this radio only has ten

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.050 
that also this radio only has ten
presets<00:04:46.199> some<00:04:46.650> radios<00:04:47.009> have<00:04:47.310> more<00:04:47.669> than<00:04:47.849> 10

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
presets some radios have more than 10

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.730 
presets some radios have more than 10
presets<00:04:48.539> on<00:04:48.719> them<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.169> think<00:04:49.439> you<00:04:49.590> need

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
presets on them so if you think you need

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.999 
presets on them so if you think you need
more<00:04:49.979> than<00:04:50.039> 10<00:04:50.879> presets<00:04:51.419> this<00:04:52.409> isn't<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
more than 10 presets this isn't the

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.700 
more than 10 presets this isn't the
radio<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:53.639> you<00:04:53.669> but<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.330> find<00:04:54.599> 10<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.259> more<00:04:55.560> than

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
radio for you but I find 10 is more than

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.379 
radio for you but I find 10 is more than
enough<00:04:55.919> for<00:04:56.129> what<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.340> use<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.849> for<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.270> can

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
enough for what I use it for you can

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.929 
enough for what I use it for you can
still<00:04:57.659> always<00:04:57.960> directly<00:04:58.889> dial<00:04:59.249> into<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.759> but

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
still always directly dial into it but

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.279 
still always directly dial into it but
like<00:05:00.150> when<00:05:00.300> you're<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:00.509> a<00:05:00.569> car<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:01.050> really

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
like when you're in a car you really

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.029 
like when you're in a car you really
want<00:05:01.499> to<00:05:01.590> be<00:05:01.740> directly<00:05:02.719> dialing<00:05:03.719> a<00:05:03.960> station<00:05:04.529> if

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
want to be directly dialing a station if

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.279 
want to be directly dialing a station if
you're<00:05:05.219> moving<00:05:05.370> particularly<00:05:05.999> so<00:05:06.449> it's<00:05:07.020> nice

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
you're moving particularly so it's nice

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.689 
you're moving particularly so it's nice
to<00:05:07.469> have<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.770> presets<00:05:09.439> at<00:05:10.439> any<00:05:10.949> rate<00:05:11.159> I<00:05:11.340> highly

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
to have the presets at any rate I highly

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.179 
to have the presets at any rate I highly
recommend<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.270> radio<00:05:13.169> but<00:05:13.500> it<00:05:13.529> is<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:13.860> basic

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
recommend this radio but it is a basic

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.309 
recommend this radio but it is a basic
radio<00:05:14.789> so<00:05:15.060> doesn't<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.479> some<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.080> more

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
radio so doesn't have some of the more

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.159 
radio so doesn't have some of the more
fancy<00:05:16.740> functions<00:05:17.250> on<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.430> but<00:05:18.120> it's<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.659> little

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
fancy functions on it but it's a little

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.600 
fancy functions on it but it's a little
more<00:05:19.259> affordable<00:05:19.710> than<00:05:20.099> some<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.490> other

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
more affordable than some of the other

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.649 
more affordable than some of the other
