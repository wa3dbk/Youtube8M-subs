you

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:02.470 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:34.970 

you

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.830 

yes<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.130> choose<00:00:36.370> valid<00:00:37.090> numbers<00:00:37.330> lien<00:00:37.600> for

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
yes I choose valid numbers lien for

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.680 
yes I choose valid numbers lien for
because<00:00:38.200> they<00:00:38.380> are<00:00:38.470> very<00:00:38.739> very<00:00:38.920> different<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
because they are very very different of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.420 
because they are very very different of
course<00:00:40.900> number<00:00:41.050> one<00:00:41.170> is<00:00:41.440> often<00:00:41.710> played<00:00:41.950> in<00:00:42.340> a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
course number one is often played in a

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.540 
course number one is often played in a
lot<00:00:42.610> number<00:00:42.910> two<00:00:43.090> but<00:00:44.020> I<00:00:44.230> think<00:00:45.040> number<00:00:45.309> three

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
lot number two but I think number three

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.990 
lot number two but I think number three
and<00:00:45.700> four<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:47.170> me<00:00:47.290> are<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:48.640> way<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.879> most

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
and four for me are in a way the most

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.320 
and four for me are in a way the most
contrasting<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:51.250> before<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.700> particularly

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
contrasting now before I particularly

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.530 
contrasting now before I particularly
feel<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:53.650> close<00:00:53.920> connection<00:00:54.550> somehow<00:00:55.089> I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
feel the close connection somehow I

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.740 
feel the close connection somehow I
always<00:00:55.809> felt<00:00:56.260> very<00:00:56.620> close<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.010> music<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.600> I

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
always felt very close to music and I

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.079 
always felt very close to music and I
notice<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.670> thing<00:01:00.909> with<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.989> piece<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.470> that

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
notice the thing with the piece is that

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.550 
notice the thing with the piece is that
no<00:01:04.089> matter<00:01:04.269> how<00:01:04.480> many<00:01:04.750> times<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.170> playing<00:01:05.440> it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
no matter how many times are playing it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.250 
no matter how many times are playing it
it<00:01:05.770> always<00:01:06.159> sounds<00:01:06.909> different<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:08.200> is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
it always sounds different and this is

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it always sounds different and this is
the<00:01:08.500> point<00:01:08.770> with<00:01:09.220> Chopin's<00:01:09.670> music<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.280> like

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the point with Chopin's music it is like

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.060 
the point with Chopin's music it is like
a<00:01:12.310> very<00:01:12.550> slippery<00:01:13.050> ball<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.650> can<00:01:14.800> um<00:01:14.950> it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
a very slippery ball you can um it's

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.910 
a very slippery ball you can um it's
very<00:01:15.100> hard<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.550> mold<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.780> exactly<00:01:17.200> in<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
very hard to mold it exactly in the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.840 
very hard to mold it exactly in the
right<00:01:18.360> places<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:19.810> that<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.290> sounds<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.850> natural

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
right places so that it sounds a natural

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.830 
right places so that it sounds a natural
exciting<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.909> also<00:01:25.030> intuitive<00:01:27.840> subtle

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
exciting but also intuitive subtle

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.219 
exciting but also intuitive subtle
intimate<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.509> find<00:01:31.719> their<00:01:31.899> goal<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
intimate so to find their goal the

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.630 
intimate so to find their goal the
middle<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.649> impossible<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.219> don't<00:01:33.430> even<00:01:33.520> think

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
middle is impossible I don't even think

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.690 
middle is impossible I don't even think
it<00:01:33.909> exists<00:01:34.270> actually<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:36.130> know<00:01:36.250> coming<00:01:36.579> back

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
it exists actually you know coming back

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.630 
it exists actually you know coming back
to<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.000> fourth<00:01:37.240> part<00:01:37.420> which<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.439> probably<00:01:39.430> one

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
to the fourth part which is probably one

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.850 
to the fourth part which is probably one
of<00:01:39.670> his<00:01:39.850> most<00:01:40.060> mature<00:01:41.670> masterpieces<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
of his most mature masterpieces just the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.709 
of his most mature masterpieces just the
way<00:01:44.979> this<00:01:45.130> structure<00:01:45.610> works<00:01:45.850> from<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.509> first

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
way this structure works from the first

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.090 
way this structure works from the first
note<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.289> last<00:01:47.500> is<00:01:47.770> quite<00:01:47.979> incredible

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
note to the last is quite incredible

00:01:48.100 --> 00:02:04.500 
note to the last is quite incredible
credible<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.270> like<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.450> perfect

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:03:32.490 

you

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.330 

the<00:03:33.430> mazurkas<00:03:34.150> these<00:03:34.750> days<00:03:35.020> are<00:03:35.260> not<00:03:35.410> that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
the mazurkas these days are not that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.450 
the mazurkas these days are not that
often<00:03:36.790> performed<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.870> feel<00:03:38.140> very<00:03:38.530> special

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
often performed that I feel very special

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.870 
often performed that I feel very special
towers<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.030> mazurkas<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.550> think<00:03:42.730> she

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
towers the mazurkas and I think she

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.610 
towers the mazurkas and I think she
learned<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.360> as<00:03:43.480> well<00:03:43.630> because<00:03:44.020> he<00:03:44.230> composed

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
learned it as well because he composed

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.420 
learned it as well because he composed
them<00:03:44.860> snort<00:03:45.160> his<00:03:45.370> life<00:03:46.800> from<00:03:47.800> beginning<00:03:48.280> till

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
them snort his life from beginning till

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
them snort his life from beginning till
and<00:03:48.820> he<00:03:49.210> was<00:03:49.330> always<00:03:49.510> composing<00:03:50.020> his<00:03:50.170> own

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and he was always composing his own

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.430 
and he was always composing his own
piece<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.760> there's<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.150> quite<00:03:52.440> beautiful

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
piece so there's a quite beautiful

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.470 
piece so there's a quite beautiful
pieces<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.400> more<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.610> play<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.210> more<00:03:55.330> I

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
pieces but the more I play the more I

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.910 
pieces but the more I play the more I
understand<00:03:55.930> why<00:03:56.050> people<00:03:56.350> don't<00:03:56.470> probably

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
understand why people don't probably

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.260 
understand why people don't probably
because<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.540> much<00:03:59.520> more<00:04:00.520> much

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
because the way it is much more much

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.320 
because the way it is much more much
much<00:04:01.600> trickier<00:04:01.990> than<00:04:02.880> most<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.090> his<00:04:04.210> other

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
much trickier than most of his other

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.540 
much trickier than most of his other
pieces<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.960> need<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.320> really<00:04:06.070> feel<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
pieces you need to really feel the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.750 
pieces you need to really feel the
polish<00:04:07.230> that's<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.890> rhythm<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.490> mazurka

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
polish that's the rhythm the mazurka

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.530 
polish that's the rhythm the mazurka
rhythm<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:12.430> also<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:14.710> way<00:04:15.270> they're<00:04:16.270> played

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
rhythm but also the way they're played

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.260 
rhythm but also the way they're played
today<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.739> quite<00:04:18.280> different<00:04:18.489> from<00:04:18.730> how<00:04:19.090> they

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
today is quite different from how they

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.130 
today is quite different from how they
were<00:04:19.299> played<00:04:19.770> in<00:04:20.770> the<00:04:20.920> past<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.549> feel<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.300> really

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
were played in the past I feel I really

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.180 
were played in the past I feel I really
love<00:04:23.620> historic<00:04:24.550> recordings<00:04:25.950> one<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:27.100> my

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
love historic recordings one of my

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.870 
love historic recordings one of my
favorite<00:04:27.550> is<00:04:27.760> Friedman<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.900> boys<00:04:29.260> age<00:04:29.880> at

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
favorite is Friedman and boys age at

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.850 
favorite is Friedman and boys age at
Hoffman<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.630> they<00:04:31.810> all<00:04:31.960> played<00:04:32.200> masuka's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
Hoffman and they all played masuka's

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.220 
Hoffman and they all played masuka's
they'll<00:04:33.160> play<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.850> lot<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.360> shoppin<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
they'll play a lot of shoppin and I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.610 
they'll play a lot of shoppin and I
think<00:04:35.440> Friedman<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.860> really<00:04:36.100> famous<00:04:36.250> for

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
think Friedman is really famous for

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.690

things<00:06:51.889> and<00:06:52.250> you<00:06:52.850> know<00:06:52.880> just<00:06:53.660> driving<00:06:53.960> it<00:06:54.080> and

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
things and you know just driving it and

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.100 
things and you know just driving it and
then<00:06:54.380> it<00:06:54.830> turned<00:06:55.130> out<00:06:55.280> something<00:06:56.000> very<00:06:56.960> very

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110

then it turned out something very very
different
