00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.280

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.840

 that a nine-year-old boy called sam 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.480
 I was coming for surgery, you're so big 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.120
 as i sam let out a small smile 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.699
 I only have nine I thought it was the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.900
 guaranteed that everyone in the hospital believed 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.790
 in that he was an adult 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.760
 the doctor checked the history 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.760
 to a tonsillectomy is that what your 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 parents told me that of you had let me 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 clarify something Mr. weston a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.680
 tonsillectomy is not something that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.690
 just a moment frightened hurt some 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.360
 once you've fallen on your knees samp nodded 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.130
 it is as painful as that to me 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 they removed the tonsils when I had your 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 age 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.110
 There is nothing to fear 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.420
 sham felt a little better and it seems 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 that there is a small problem we do not have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.610
 the tools necessary for your case 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.530
 sam's sat quietly 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
 while his parents arranged everything 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.880
 they took sham to his room and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.979
 they left for the waiting room where 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.220
 they would be until the surgery had 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.500
 place a nurse helped sham to 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.650
 settle in bed and gave him some 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 juice sanz turned to his right and saw 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.990

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.120
 my name is not this the child told me 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.140
 mysterious of the other bed 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.720
 the nurse looked sad 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.090
 a few minutes passed and I was 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.160
 painting in his picture book the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 nurse had left to leave 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.010
 rest 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.410
 tommy turned towards sham pointed a 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.459
 cartoon that sanz had at the foot of his 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.349
 bed the spiderman is my favorite the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.760
 mine too 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.350
 sanz tried to launch a network of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.080
 cobwebs to the face of take 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.850
 why are you here asked the boy 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.630
 mysterious tonsils answered sanz 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.630

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.350
 said that take it turned around 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.620
 they spent a few more minutes in silence 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.620
 then take that the voice you like to sleep 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.560
 unlike most children 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.810
 Assembly loved to sleep I thought that 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.530
 the faster he fell asleep 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.630
 I could play the next day if my mom 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 always try to wake me up so I do not 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.770
 arrive late to school but never 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.870
 I can hear her say she could sleep 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.830
 even during an earthquake 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.970
 Tome turned off the light and returned to his bed 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.970
 sam understood the gesture 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.620
 we have to start anesthetizing this 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.600
 child the noise made wake up sham what 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.889
 They were driving down a hallway 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.990
 hospital the lights illuminated his face 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.010
 I look at the surgeons I had not seen them 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.830
 before 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.070
 he realized that the time came 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.590
 his tonsils would come out his parents 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.680
 they said that I could eat all the ice cream 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.560
 that he wanted when the operation will end 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.020
 the little one could only think about what type 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.150
 I would like to eat ice cream while 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.420
 surgeons pushed the doors of a 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.630
 room with a chair 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.800

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:00.040

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.220

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.040
 surgeon put on a face mask 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.340
 sham panicked but his screams 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.130
 they were drowned by anesthesia could 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.280
 take a last look at the tommy hall 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.100
 I was on the other side of the doors 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:39.100
 smiling 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.100

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.960
