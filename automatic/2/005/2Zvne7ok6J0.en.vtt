00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
yeah exactly the point is you're saying

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
yeah exactly the point is you're saying
that<00:02:07.380> DNA<00:02:07.859> is<00:02:07.920> changed<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.489> much<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.849> six<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that DNA is changed that much in six and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
that DNA is changed that much in six and
half<00:02:09.269> thousand<00:02:09.629> years<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:10.019> six<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.259> half

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
half thousand years that's six and half

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
half thousand years that's six and half
thousand<00:02:10.769> years<00:02:10.800> ago<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.940> genetically

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
thousand years ago it was genetically

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.369 
thousand years ago it was genetically
valuable<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:14.099> have<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.519> for<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:14.760> sister

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
valuable to have it all for your sister

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.750 
valuable to have it all for your sister
it's<00:02:16.379> not<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.830> Bible<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.310> here<00:02:17.640> then

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it's not the Bible is right here then

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.400 
it's not the Bible is right here then
when<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:17.940> comes<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.269> time<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.540> Moses<00:02:18.989> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
when it comes to time of Moses that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.530 
when it comes to time of Moses that
attend<00:02:19.709> four<00:02:19.950> beds<00:02:20.160> brothers<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.120> sisters<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
attend four beds brothers and sisters to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.600 
attend four beds brothers and sisters to
marry<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.650> Bible<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.920> very<00:02:23.010> specific<00:02:23.489> but

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
marry and the Bible is very specific but

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.070 
marry and the Bible is very specific but
the<00:02:23.730> reason<00:02:24.000> for<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.599> they're<00:02:24.750> not<00:02:24.840> too

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
the reason for that is they're not too

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960 
the reason for that is they're not too
close<00:02:25.349> is<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:25.950> true<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.190> prolly

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
close is that true for prolly

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.229 
close is that true for prolly
tonight<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.049> fill<00:02:28.680> I'd<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.610> like<00:02:29.849> I'm<00:02:30.030> not

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
just would like to ask the question in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170 
just would like to ask the question in
his<00:02:33.930> Mitch's<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.730> obviously<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.819> believe<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
his Mitch's and obviously I believe the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.539 
his Mitch's and obviously I believe the
Bible<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.569> well<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.140> but<00:02:37.920> you're<00:02:38.040> saying<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
Bible is well and but you're saying that

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.550 
Bible is well and but you're saying that
like<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.030> beginning<00:02:39.420> God<00:02:39.660> made<00:02:39.690> mankind

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
like in the beginning God made mankind

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.729 
like in the beginning God made mankind
so<00:02:40.950> why<00:02:41.250> are<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.269> getting<00:02:42.959> close<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.379> then

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
so why are they getting close and then

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.610 
so why are they getting close and then
he<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.129> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.459> stopped<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.480> further<00:02:46.470> on

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
he just kind of stopped it further on

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.589 
he just kind of stopped it further on
down<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.920> line<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.340> don't<00:02:47.670> get<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> as<00:02:48.329> we're

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
down the line I don't get that as we're

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.509 
down the line I don't get that as we're
heading<00:02:48.750> downhill<00:02:49.110> genetically<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.280> comes

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
heading downhill genetically it comes

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.190 
heading downhill genetically it comes

was<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.150> hair-raising<00:02:57.510> ideas<00:02:58.470> about<00:02:58.709> DNA

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
was some hair-raising ideas about DNA

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.660 
was some hair-raising ideas about DNA
and<00:02:59.310> incest<00:02:59.910> being<00:03:00.180> founded<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:01.670> Tim

and incest being founded about Tim
however<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:04.019> interested<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
however is just interested in the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.240 
however is just interested in the
evidence<00:03:06.200> he's<00:03:07.200> dug<00:03:07.500> up<00:03:07.680> hundreds<00:03:08.160> of

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
evidence he's dug up hundreds of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.099 
evidence he's dug up hundreds of
human-like<00:03:08.790> schools<00:03:09.150> from<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.540> same<00:03:09.750> value

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
human-like schools from the same value

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.009 
human-like schools from the same value
in<00:03:10.200> Ethiopia<00:03:11.269> carbon<00:03:12.269> dating<00:03:12.599> has<00:03:12.630> put<00:03:12.870> them

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
in Ethiopia carbon dating has put them

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.979 
in Ethiopia carbon dating has put them
at<00:03:13.109> different<00:03:13.260> ages<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.910> concern<00:03:15.450> put<00:03:15.840> them

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
at different ages but concern put them

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.890 
at different ages but concern put them
in<00:03:16.079> chronological<00:03:16.410> order<00:03:16.889> by<00:03:17.370> sight<00:03:17.670> alone<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
in chronological order by sight alone so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.809 
in chronological order by sight alone so
let's<00:03:19.079> go<00:03:19.260> let's<00:03:19.650> take<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.280> one<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.639> one<00:03:20.790> is

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
let's go let's take that one that one is

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.729 
let's go let's take that one that one is
right<00:03:21.209> from<00:03:21.450> what<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.109> that's<00:03:22.530> that's

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
right from what is that that's that's

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.879 
right from what is that that's that's
from<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> million<00:03:23.310> years<00:03:23.700> old<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.810> know<00:03:25.709> it's

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
from a million years old I know it's

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.710 
from a million years old I know it's
like<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.579> these<00:03:26.700> are<00:03:26.880> easily<00:03:27.389> always

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
like this so these are easily always

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.809 
like this so these are easily always
well<00:03:28.109> right<00:03:28.410> yeah<00:03:28.739> that's<00:03:29.160> right<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.790> I

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
well right yeah that's right so I

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.830 
well right yeah that's right so I
suppose<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.150> before<00:03:30.359> we<00:03:30.450> go<00:03:30.599> over<00:03:30.720> here

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
suppose it before we go over here

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.740 
suppose it before we go over here
because<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.950> where<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.849> brow<00:03:33.150> comes<00:03:33.480> up

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
because the the where the brow comes up

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.039 
because the the where the brow comes up
perfect<00:03:34.200> similar<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.919> got<00:03:35.160> it

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
perfect similar to this one you got it

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.930 
perfect similar to this one you got it
careful<00:03:37.049> now<00:03:37.859> they<00:03:38.099> may<00:03:38.280> not<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.760> real

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
careful now they may not be the real

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.210 
careful now they may not be the real
fossils<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.630> there's<00:03:40.019> only<00:03:40.230> one<00:03:40.530> copy<00:03:40.859> in<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
fossils but there's only one copy in the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949 
fossils but there's only one copy in the
United<00:03:41.579> States<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.209> don't<00:03:42.540> want<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.750> break

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
United States so we don't want to break

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.770 
United States so we don't want to break
it<00:03:43.139> mm-hmm<00:03:44.040> I'm<00:03:44.310> gonna<00:03:44.760> put<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:44.970> one<00:03:45.030> here<00:03:45.510> or

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
it mm-hmm I'm gonna put this one here or

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.400 
it mm-hmm I'm gonna put this one here or
thinking<00:03:46.489> now<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:48.269> got<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.720> order<00:03:48.989> exactly

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
thinking now you got the order exactly

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.280 
thinking now you got the order exactly
correct<00:03:50.040> because<00:03:50.609> what<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.209> find<00:03:51.450> that's<00:03:52.079> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
correct because what we find that's the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.740 
correct because what we find that's the
closest<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.889> top<00:03:53.160> no<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:54.120> got<00:03:54.299> one<00:03:54.510> out<00:03:54.720> of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
closest to the top no you got one out of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.110 
closest to the top no you got one out of
order<00:03:55.109> the<00:03:55.230> Kenyan<00:03:55.590> one<00:03:55.799> oh<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.340> alright

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
order the Kenyan one oh that's alright

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030 
order the Kenyan one oh that's alright
that's<00:03:57.630> good<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.230> good<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:58.889> get

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
that's good that's good and then we get

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.229 
that's good that's good and then we get
back<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.430> four<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.790> half<00:03:59.819> million<00:04:00.120> years

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
back to four and a half million years

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.360 
back to four and a half million years
ago<00:04:00.510> now<00:04:00.720> remember<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.319> talked<00:04:01.769> about<00:04:01.889> one

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
ago now remember I talked about one

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.360 
ago now remember I talked about one
Valley<00:04:03.269> in<00:04:03.660> Africa<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:05.280> stack<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.419> rocks<00:04:07.370> now

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
Valley in Africa one stack of rocks now

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.920 
Valley in Africa one stack of rocks now
according<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:10.019> idea<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:11.930> humans

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
according to the idea that humans

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170 
according to the idea that humans
haven't<00:04:13.320> changed<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.039> we<00:04:14.759> should<00:04:14.940> find

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
haven't changed and we should find

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420

humans<00:04:15.630> all<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.900> way<00:04:16.019> back<00:04:16.289> now<00:04:17.070> we've<00:04:17.250> got<00:04:17.400> a

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
humans all the way back now we've got a

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.840 
humans all the way back now we've got a
problem

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
problem

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.270 
problem
in<00:04:18.060> terms<00:04:18.240> of<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.480> evidence<00:04:19.100> because<00:04:20.100> we

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
in terms of the evidence because we

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.540 
in terms of the evidence because we
don't<00:04:20.520> find<00:04:20.940> any<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.840> those<00:04:22.170> guys<00:04:22.530> down<00:04:23.340> any

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
don't find any of those guys down any

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.610 
don't find any of those guys down any
early<00:04:23.970> records<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.840> we<00:04:24.930> don't<00:04:25.080> find<00:04:25.260> any<00:04:25.470> of

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
early records and we don't find any of

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.700 
early records and we don't find any of
these<00:04:25.890> in<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:27.030> later<00:04:27.300> records<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.320> looks

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
these in the later records so it looks

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.270 
these in the later records so it looks
like<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:30.150> model<00:04:30.750> where<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.710> should<00:04:31.890> be<00:04:32.040> all

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
like that model where it should be all
