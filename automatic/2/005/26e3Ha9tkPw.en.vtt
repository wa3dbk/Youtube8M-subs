00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
get a better kill streak out of it so I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.620 
get a better kill streak out of it so I
got<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.549> stealth<00:02:54.819> chopper<00:02:54.970> saw<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.390> kind<00:02:55.569> of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
got a stealth chopper saw is kind of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.890

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
giddy about that but yeah that is why

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.050 
giddy about that but yeah that is why
you<00:02:58.959> would<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.410> a<00:02:59.440> dead<00:03:00.130> silence<00:03:00.310> because<00:03:01.030> a

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you would use a dead silence because a

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.850 
you would use a dead silence because a
lot<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.390> people<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:02.049> hear<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.620> lot<00:03:02.829> of

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
not noticing and I just contradicted

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.250 
not noticing and I just contradicted
myself<00:04:39.030> because<00:04:39.390> I'm<00:04:39.510> not<00:04:39.630> rushing<00:04:39.930> out<00:04:40.050> this

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
myself because I'm not rushing out this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.330 
myself because I'm not rushing out this
is<00:04:40.350> because<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.650> don't<00:04:40.800> have<00:04:40.890> light<00:04:41.070> weight<00:04:41.190> on

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
is because I don't have light weight on

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.740 
is because I don't have light weight on
but<00:04:41.610> if<00:04:41.700> I<00:04:41.820> did<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.000> would<00:04:42.240> have<00:04:42.330> rushed<00:04:42.510> out

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
but if I did I would have rushed out

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.140 
but if I did I would have rushed out
either<00:04:43.050> underneath<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.890> map<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.640> side<00:04:44.850> or

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
either underneath the map to the side or

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.910 
either underneath the map to the side or
through<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.510> straight<00:04:45.720> middle<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.200> plan<00:04:46.800> on

through the straight middle and plan on
the<00:04:47.010> Bombers<00:04:47.280> because<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.640> can<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.450> plan<00:04:48.690> it

the Bombers because I can but I plan it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.390 
the Bombers because I can but I plan it
quick<00:04:48.960> enough<00:04:49.260> since<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.560> team<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.920> nowhere

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
quick enough since the team is nowhere
