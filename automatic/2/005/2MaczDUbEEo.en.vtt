00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
largely because I just asked them if

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.490 
largely because I just asked them if
they<00:00:23.590> had<00:00:23.619> ever<00:00:24.160> written<00:00:24.400> a<00:00:24.730> book<00:00:25.210> before

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500

I've<00:00:28.210> written<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.689> few<00:00:28.869> in<00:00:29.109> the<00:00:29.259> past<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.740> I

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
I've written a few in the past and I

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.380 
I've written a few in the past and I
think<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.150> bottom<00:00:31.480> line<00:00:31.509> is<00:00:32.699> write<00:00:33.699> what<00:00:34.360> you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
think the bottom line is write what you

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.710 
think the bottom line is write what you
know<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.930> own<00:00:35.739> what<00:00:36.010> you<00:00:36.129> write<00:00:36.339> and<00:00:37.299> I<00:00:37.479> mean

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
know and own what you write and I mean

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.740 
know and own what you write and I mean
that<00:00:37.750> in<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.140> strictest<00:00:38.559> sense<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.120> don't

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
that in the strictest sense if you don't

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.740 
that in the strictest sense if you don't
understand<00:00:41.229> a<00:00:41.500> subject<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.750> probably

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
understand a subject you probably

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.240 
understand a subject you probably
shouldn't<00:00:44.110> be<00:00:44.199> writing<00:00:44.470> about<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.949> I<00:00:45.040> realized

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
shouldn't be writing about it I realized

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.979 
shouldn't be writing about it I realized
the<00:00:45.549> irony<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.909> this<00:00:46.119> statement<00:00:46.449> is<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.960> a

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
the irony of this statement is that a

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.140 
the irony of this statement is that a

and<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:52.030> becomes<00:00:52.540> blatantly<00:00:53.140> obvious<00:00:53.290> when

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and that becomes blatantly obvious when

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.729
