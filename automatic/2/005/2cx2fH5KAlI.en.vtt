00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.750
 voluntary doctoral examination in physics 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.750
 do you know or hello hello 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.599
 I'm a cosmologist that 's me studying 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.859
 the marriage of space and time 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.859
 the perfect couple 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.430
 You never know where the next big one is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.759
 Ultimately, leap forward or come 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.759
 from whom 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.590
 and if i just have the time 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 Turn back to the beginning to see what 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.250
 back to the beginning of time 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.920
 steadily moving on, I know 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.719

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.719
 continue to turn where 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.600
 It is called motor neurone disease 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 the life expectancy is two 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.690
 years I want us to be together 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.690
 as long as possible 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.860
 they do not know what to expect 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.860
 It will be a very bitter defeat 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.060
 but I love him and he loves me 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.750
 We will share this disease together 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.750
 fight 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.270

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 and that black hole in the beginning of the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.520
 Time 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.310

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.750

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.440
 he will only survive if the one 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.710

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 scientifically and personally 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.959
 should not can border 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.959
 however bad life may seem 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.959
