the end of it and it's really really

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.719 
the end of it and it's really really
interesting<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.649> sort<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
interesting to sort of see the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
interesting to sort of see the
difference<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> opinions<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.140> special

difference of opinions the special

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
difference of opinions the special
powers<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.100> mentioned<00:01:47.399> before<00:01:47.460> seem<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
powers that I mentioned before seem to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
powers that I mentioned before seem to
have<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.180> huge<00:01:48.600> range<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.860> heroes

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
have a huge range it's a bit like heroes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
have a huge range it's a bit like heroes
in<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> respect<00:01:51.090> because<00:01:51.270> anything<00:01:51.840> could

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
in that respect because anything could

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420 
in that respect because anything could
happen<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.500> could<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.829> introduce<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
happen they could just introduce a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
happen they could just introduce a
character<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:54.149> make<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:54.990> happen<00:01:55.409> for

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
character to make something happen for

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.889 
character to make something happen for
example<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.090> communicating<00:01:57.810> with

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
example they have communicating with

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.429 
example they have communicating with
animals

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439

teleportation<00:02:02.130> everything<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> think

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
teleportation everything and I think

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.850 
teleportation everything and I think
that<00:02:03.540> makes<00:02:03.659> very<00:02:03.810> interesting<00:02:04.200> watching<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that makes very interesting watching the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
that makes very interesting watching the
animation<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> absolutely<00:02:06.119> stunning<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.509> part

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
animation is absolutely stunning in part

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330 
animation is absolutely stunning in part
I<00:02:07.049> found<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> action<00:02:07.979> scenes<00:02:08.220> just

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I found that the action scenes just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
I found that the action scenes just
flowed<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.479> really<00:02:09.840> well

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
flowed really really well

example<00:02:32.700> I've<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:32.970> started<00:02:33.300> watching<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
example I've just started watching a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.200 
example I've just started watching a
series<00:02:34.110> called<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.680> sound<00:02:35.370> lost<00:02:35.790> memories

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
shapes in this basically it reminds me

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.250 
shapes in this basically it reminds me
of<00:02:40.800> Eureka<00:02:41.190> Seven<00:02:41.660> but<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> characters<00:02:43.140> in

attention<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.430> there's<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> lot<00:02:47.970> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
attention to it because there's a lot of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.060 
attention to it because there's a lot of
stuff<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.630> off<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.350> time<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.830> show

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
stuff going off all the time in the show

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.280 
stuff going off all the time in the show
and<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.550> takes<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.150> main<00:02:51.300> focus<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and that takes my main focus but the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.840 
and that takes my main focus but the
bits<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> don't<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> lot<00:02:53.490> going<00:02:53.640> off

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
bits that don't have a lot going off

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.420 
bits that don't have a lot going off
don't<00:02:54.300> seem<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.870> much<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:56.100> soundtrack

I<00:03:35.910> guess<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.540> was<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> compare<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
I guess if I was to compare this to

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.040 
I guess if I was to compare this to
other<00:03:37.739> bone<00:03:38.100> series<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:39.300> kind<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.600> easy<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
other bone series it's kind of easy to

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.449 
other bone series it's kind of easy to
do<00:03:40.290> because<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.739> can<00:03:40.769> see<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.220> influence

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
do because you can see the influence

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.729 
do because you can see the influence
from<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.269> lot<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.630> different<00:03:42.840> bone<00:03:43.230> shows<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
from a lot of different bone shows I

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.229 
from a lot of different bone shows I
feel<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.310> takes<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.670> action<00:03:45.000> scenes

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
feel like it takes the action scenes

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.940 
feel like it takes the action scenes
from<00:03:45.420> darker<00:03:45.690> than<00:03:45.840> black<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.440> animation

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
from darker than black the animation

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.150 
from darker than black the animation
from<00:03:47.160> Star<00:03:47.400> Driver<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.630> story<00:03:49.170> elements

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
from Star Driver and the story elements

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.400 
from Star Driver and the story elements
from<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.850> Sam's<00:03:51.090> lost<00:03:51.330> memories<00:03:51.690> well<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.200> love

from the Sam's lost memories well I love
Star<00:03:52.620> Trek<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.830> started<00:03:53.190> off<00:03:53.250> as<00:03:53.340> one<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> my

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
Star Trek I started off as one of my

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.979 
Star Trek I started off as one of my
favorite<00:03:53.820> shows<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.090> love<00:03:54.299> dark<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.660> black<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
favorite shows I love dark and black and

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.810 
favorite shows I love dark and black and
I'm<00:03:55.049> running<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.380> drawings<00:03:55.650> um<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.100> far<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
I'm running and drawings um so far so

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.070 
I'm running and drawings um so far so
it's<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.239> really<00:03:57.420> really<00:03:57.600> good<00:03:57.780> combination

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
it's a really really good combination

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.990 
it's a really really good combination
for<00:03:58.410> me<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.100> think<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.489> an<00:03:59.670> accumulation

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
for me and I think it's an accumulation

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.240 
for me and I think it's an accumulation
of<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> best<00:04:00.780> parts<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.320> all<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.650> those<00:04:01.769> series

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
of the best parts of all of those series

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.240 
of the best parts of all of those series
so<00:04:02.790> far<00:04:03.090> these<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.900> been<00:04:04.049> around<00:04:04.200> 45<00:04:04.920> minutes

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
so far these have been around 45 minutes

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.580 
so far these have been around 45 minutes
long<00:04:05.400> each<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.239> don't<00:04:06.299> think<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.440> could

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
long each and I don't think I could

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.720 
long each and I don't think I could
actually<00:04:07.709> recommend<00:04:08.190> these<00:04:08.250> two<00:04:08.430> films

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
actually recommend these two films

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.060 
actually recommend these two films
enough<00:04:08.940> they're<00:04:09.360> told<00:04:09.570> really<00:04:10.140> well<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.799> well

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
enough they're told really well and well

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.310 
enough they're told really well and well
directed<00:04:11.610> well<00:04:12.060> animated<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.870> can't<00:04:13.110> think

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
directed well animated and I can't think

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.110 
directed well animated and I can't think
of<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.470> reason<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.920> people<00:04:13.980> not<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.549> try<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:14.970> out

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
of a reason for people not to try it out

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
of a reason for people not to try it out
at<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.420> very<00:04:15.570> least<00:04:15.750> tono<00:04:16.560> can<00:04:16.769> go<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.100> check

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
at the very least tono can go and check

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.770 
at the very least tono can go and check
it<00:04:17.340> out<00:04:17.459> I'll<00:04:17.609> put<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.030> link<00:04:18.209> down<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.750> the
