00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
old filter pad in it to try and start

old filter pad in it to try and start
getting<00:00:14.309> things<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:15.260> we've<00:00:16.260> got<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.770> pump

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
getting things going we've got the pump

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.300 
getting things going we've got the pump
on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> back<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> little

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
on the back up here this is a little

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.759 
on the back up here this is a little
piece<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> found<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:22.320> actually<00:00:22.619> for

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
piece that I found it's actually for

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.630 
piece that I found it's actually for
irrigation<00:00:23.750> for<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> drip<00:00:25.080> system<00:00:25.279> but<00:00:26.279> flip<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
irrigation for a drip system but flip it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.830 
irrigation for a drip system but flip it
around<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> turns

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
around and it actually kind of turns

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.900 
around and it actually kind of turns
into<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.170> venturi<00:00:31.489> stop<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:34.790> turn<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
into a venturi stop it that way turn it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
into a venturi stop it that way turn it
back<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.590> air<00:00:37.829> hose<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.250> bit

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
back on I had two air hose a little bit

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.700 
back on I had two air hose a little bit
later<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> forced<00:00:40.530> air

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
later on and make it a forced air

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
later on and make it a forced air
venturi<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:46.219> slow<00:00:47.219> down<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
venturi this is my slow down here and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
venturi this is my slow down here and
then<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.620> gonna<00:00:49.739> come<00:00:49.950> into<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:51.079> radial

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
then we're gonna come into my radial

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
then we're gonna come into my radial
flow<00:00:53.539> there<00:00:54.539> without<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.079> bucket<00:00:55.410> top<00:00:55.789> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
flow there without it's bucket top that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
flow there without it's bucket top that
goes<00:00:56.969> over<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:59.449> bio<00:01:00.449> filter<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.559> does

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
goes over into the bio filter which does

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
goes over into the bio filter which does
not<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.789> enough<00:01:03.979> aeration<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.430> yet

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
not have enough aeration and it just yet

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
not have enough aeration and it just yet
to<00:01:05.729> get<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.799> pump

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to get those going but that little pump

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.340 
to get those going but that little pump
was<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> free<00:01:09.090> pump<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:12.350> Island

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
was a free pump so that is why Island

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
was a free pump so that is why Island
Dan<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:14.010> allowing<00:01:14.310> me<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> borrow<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Dan is actually allowing me to borrow it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.929 
Dan is actually allowing me to borrow it
for<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> moment<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> my

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
for the moment and then down here is my

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.039 
for the moment and then down here is my
sump<00:01:18.299> tank<00:01:18.540> where<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.930> pump<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:24.049> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
sump tank where the pump is at and that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
sump tank where the pump is at and that
is<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> most<00:01:25.920> annoying<00:01:26.220> noise<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> makes

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
is the most annoying noise that it makes

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.450 
is the most annoying noise that it makes
if<00:01:28.080> someone<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> give<00:01:28.710> me<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.130> idea<00:01:29.159> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
if someone can give me a good idea on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
if someone can give me a good idea on
how<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> make<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.210> bubble<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> time

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
how to make it not bubble all the time

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.800 
how to make it not bubble all the time
that<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.130> awesome

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that would be awesome

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.340 
that would be awesome
anyway<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> bio<00:01:36.479> filter<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.079> comes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
anyway so the the bio filter then comes

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.340 
anyway so the the bio filter then comes
out<00:01:37.530> into<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.990> teed<00:01:39.990> off<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
out into this teed off little

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:50.380 
out into this teed off little
distribution<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:44.060> at<00:01:45.060> number<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:47.600> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
distribution and then at number one and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.789 
distribution and then at number one and
comes<00:01:51.390> over<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.899> I've<00:01:52.049> got<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.500> bridge

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
comes over here I've got to bridge

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
comes over here I've got to bridge
siphons<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> reason<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
siphons the reason for that was the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.709 
siphons the reason for that was the
first<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.149> did<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.180> seem<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.070> keep<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> level

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
first one did not seem to keep the level

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.770 
first one did not seem to keep the level
that<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> wanted<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> keep<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.390> second

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that I wanted it to keep in the second

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.550 
that I wanted it to keep in the second
Grove<00:02:03.960> edge<00:02:04.140> give<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.590> high<00:02:04.770> enough<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Grove edge give a high enough and so I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.130 
Grove edge give a high enough and so I
added<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.099> second<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.090> make<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.539> standpipe

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
added a second one to make the standpipe

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.749 
added a second one to make the standpipe
kind<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
kind of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.399 
kind of
more<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.150> work<00:02:11.299> for<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:13.040> keep<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.230> grow<00:02:15.230> bed

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
more to work for and keep the grow bed

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.289 
more to work for and keep the grow bed
level<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> little<00:02:15.769> bit<00:02:15.890> different<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:17.150> then

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
level a little bit different and then

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.520 
level a little bit different and then
coming<00:02:17.569> down<00:02:17.599> here<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.439> a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
coming down here is it's just a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.850 
coming down here is it's just a
standpipe<00:02:18.950> down<00:02:19.189> here<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:21.170> haven't<00:02:21.769> figured

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
standpipe down here I haven't figured

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.149 
standpipe down here I haven't figured
out<00:02:22.040> exactly<00:02:22.189> how<00:02:22.579> I<00:02:22.610> want<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.849> do<00:02:22.939> this<00:02:23.030> yet

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
out exactly how I want to do this yet

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.970 
out exactly how I want to do this yet
obviously<00:02:25.159> it<00:02:25.310> makes<00:02:25.549> noise<00:02:26.709> quite<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.739> bit<00:02:27.890> of

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
obviously it makes noise quite a bit of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.690 
obviously it makes noise quite a bit of
the<00:02:28.040> noise<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.400> want<00:02:28.549> to<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.700> rid<00:02:28.909> of<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.560> I

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
the noise I want to get rid of that I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.330 
the noise I want to get rid of that I
have<00:02:31.700> both<00:02:31.909> sides<00:02:32.209> ones<00:02:32.480> cut<00:02:32.930> ones<00:02:33.170> cut<00:02:33.590> both

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
have both sides ones cut ones cut both

styrofoam up for rafts and hopefully get
my<00:03:01.909> net<00:03:02.150> pots<00:03:02.389> in<00:03:02.569> soon<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.560> start
