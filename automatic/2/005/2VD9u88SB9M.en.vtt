00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.539 

yeah<00:03:26.959> i<00:03:27.350> i'm<00:03:28.310> not<00:03:28.579> sure<00:03:28.730> for<00:03:28.940> ps3<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:30.230> xbox<00:03:31.220> but

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
yeah i i'm not sure for ps3 and xbox but

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.470 
yeah i i'm not sure for ps3 and xbox but
i'm<00:03:31.640> assuming<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.299> might

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
i'm assuming and might

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.380 
i'm assuming and might
not<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.440> sure<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:34.920> i<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.129> i<00:03:35.430> should<00:03:35.489> but

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
not really sure but i think i should but

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
not really sure but i think i should but

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
all right but 600 speed 300 plus 300 of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
all right but 600 speed 300 plus 300 of
the<00:03:48.989> Rings<00:03:49.370> Japan<00:03:50.370> see<00:03:50.670> all<00:03:51.360> right<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.660> let's

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
the Rings Japan see all right so let's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.960 
the Rings Japan see all right so let's
open<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.319> thing<00:03:55.250> first<00:03:56.250> thing<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.610> you'll

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
open this thing first thing that you'll

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.949 
open this thing first thing that you'll
see<00:03:57.799> will<00:03:58.799> probably<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.700> in<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.930> a

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
see will probably be this in like a

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:08.410 
see will probably be this in like a
little<00:04:01.110> band

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.809 

hot<00:04:08.990> cheese<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.500> can't<00:04:09.770> like<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.099> can<00:04:10.280> like<00:04:10.430> if

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
hot cheese I can't like you can like if

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.550 
hot cheese I can't like you can like if
you<00:04:11.240> don't<00:04:11.360> want<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.569> plug<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.810> right<00:04:12.349> there

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
you don't want to plug that right there

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.370 
you don't want to plug that right there
directly<00:04:13.459> into<00:04:13.790> your<00:04:13.819> computer<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:14.989> can<00:04:15.110> just

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
directly into your computer you can just

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.099 
directly into your computer you can just
plug<00:04:15.950> into<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:16.579> and<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.090> plug<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.840> side

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
plug into this and then plug this side

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.220 
plug into this and then plug this side
into<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.510> like<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.750> thing<00:04:20.930> along<00:04:21.139> this<00:04:21.350> is

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
into it like this thing along this is

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.379 
into it like this thing along this is
nothing<00:04:24.230> but<00:04:25.240> yeah<00:04:26.240> I'd<00:04:26.810> say<00:04:26.870> it's<00:04:27.320> about<00:04:31.389> well

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
nothing but yeah I'd say it's about well

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.170 
nothing but yeah I'd say it's about well
probably<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:33.139> three<00:04:33.980> feet<00:04:34.220> can<00:04:34.760> have<00:04:34.940> feet

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
probably about three feet can have feet

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.990 
probably about three feet can have feet
probably<00:04:35.810> around<00:04:35.870> there<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.410> then<00:04:37.220> here<00:04:37.669> is

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
probably around there and then here is

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500 
probably around there and then here is
the<00:04:38.260> netgear<00:04:39.310> its<00:04:40.310> actual<00:04:40.760> self<00:04:41.030> when<00:04:41.419> you

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
the netgear its actual self when you

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.780 
the netgear its actual self when you
plug<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.840> in<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.200> think<00:04:42.950> this<00:04:43.130> red<00:04:43.310> light<00:04:43.490> pops

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
plug it in I think this red light pops

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.540 
plug it in I think this red light pops
on<00:04:44.000> right<00:04:44.210> here<00:04:44.389> or<00:04:44.630> blue<00:04:45.020> he<00:04:45.770> presses<00:04:46.160> bun<00:04:46.370> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
on right here or blue he presses bun to

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.300 
on right here or blue he presses bun to
disconnect<00:04:47.150> from<00:04:47.210> my<00:04:47.479> flight<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:48.220> don't<00:04:49.220> know<00:04:49.280> I

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
disconnect from my flight I don't know I

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.360 
disconnect from my flight I don't know I
don't<00:04:49.400> really<00:04:49.729> use<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.229> because<00:04:51.229> i<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:52.220> in

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
don't really use that because i have in

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.240 
don't really use that because i have in
the<00:04:52.520> back<00:04:52.669> of<00:04:52.790> my<00:04:52.820> computer<00:04:53.240> over<00:04:54.020> there<00:04:54.250> but
