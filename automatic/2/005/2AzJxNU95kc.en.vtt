00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.010
 Hey 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.820
 today we are driving in the peugeot 2008 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 it is the successor of the 207 sw 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 kind of illogical it is so that series 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
 once started with the 205 a tank under 206 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.409
 and 207 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 not all of them a sw version 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.329
 no 206 sw and ocw and an expectation 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.279
 between 2 and 8 sw 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.769
 but by is not heard it is the 2008 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 words like a car that is based on 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.890
 the 208 just a little higher is not 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 really a mpv and why is not in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 real MPV but more ordinary station wagon 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.329
 that's because only that judge 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 front seat 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 it can be flat and the rear seat can 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.640
 of course flat where I am nothing 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.960
 variable in the sense that you met 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 can move seats 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.730
 so it's just getting you just heard 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.530
 so with the 208, 2008 also has one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 relatively small steering wheel somewhat low and car 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.269
 is in those counters that we are correct 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 upstairs in the 208 liked the less 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.589
 because with my height 1 meter 87 I sat 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 really a board and then view and u 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.400
 I can perfectly send it to the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.750
 watch counters and control them there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750
 also just perfect my total 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.230
 who is in the back 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.540
 it is not very easy about easy 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.950
 so once you sit down your head space 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 in at large 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 the legroom in the back is for his 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.240
 class but just from that you can see it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 child's seat in that room is not already 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.790
 too big 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 a second somebody back seat that is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.190
 very flat and down, no support whatsoever 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.440
 is in a turn first look for 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.899
 he can be the trunk for his 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.820
 class quite reasonable 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.869
 You do compare wax with a 208 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.869
 100 liters more 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.700
 a bit old-fashioned with such a modern car 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.210
 that thing is still a clip 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.100
 key must open then the dimensions 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.890
 he is 20 centimeters longer than the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 208 and are ten centimeters higher than 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.369
 208 so it's good for the main room 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200
 does he have extra legroom 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.450
 well that is not because that wheelbase 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 deepcreek remained the same 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.519
 can not only in one 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.869
 parking garage so therefore show 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.580
 we drove friction 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.980
 if you have the optional panoramic roof 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 ordered such a large glass roof 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.470
 then the evenings estimate more 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.470
 nice LED light on fire 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.580
 in 2008 in a fairly light motorway 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.390
 but 1000 kilos then you think of a small 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.489
 motor 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.290
 that will satisfy in not entirely true 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.300
 because they now have the smallest 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.090
 gasoline engine and a 2 liter 3 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.069
 cylinder gasoline engine with 86 hp 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.720
 in it it doesn't mean it is 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.030
 is just nice and flat for the Netherlands 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.590
 then we still have but do not 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.640
 I'm going to sport with this car in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 then go that route 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.780
 then choose whether the larger gasoline engine and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.780
 a princess or a doing diesels 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.200
 if you specifically go for it frugality 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.100
 obtains this version as specified by the manufacturer 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.000
 the 1 in 20 it can also get 1 in 23 then 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.530
 you get the one point 2 dvd with the one from heco 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.989
 which has 1000 euros cheaper 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.180
 nice but what do you get 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.819
 also always does half automatically 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.860
 the influx i semi-automatic from peugeot 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.900
 we have already discussed that in the 208 and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.790
 that is a vending machine that is incredibly 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.790
 slow and uncomfortable 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.840
 also a comfort and driving characteristics 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.859
 the 208 and this 2008 seem incredibly 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.600
 a lot like each other 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.280
 they are just as comfortable and mine 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.739
 suspension also so relaxed handling 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.090
 of these 2008 only slightly less 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.510
 to natural something center of gravity something 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.510
 is higher 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.800
 because after that happened that it is measured 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880
 one of the disadvantages of 2008 is considerable 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.130
 braking distance 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200
 this was my 7 km per hour imagine that 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.150
 had happened at 100 km then the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.870
 renault captur is a direct competitor 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.000
 he had stopped earlier than 7 meters 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.460
 come to the conclusion about 2018 is best 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.400
 positive because it is essentially a 208 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.750
 which, however, is high that they interior space 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.570
 but there are also two important ones 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.100
 disadvantages first disadvantage that is a measured 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.450
 disadvantage that is namely that braking distance and 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.220
 show below 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.709
 The second drawback is that it can be one 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.150
 dual mode of how reliable is well 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.290
 that 2008 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.740
 we know the brand reliability of 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.650
 show is so far not so high and the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.540
 two 018 takes much better but in 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.010
 the 2008 will do just as well as the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.120
 208 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.120
 once again the future will tell
