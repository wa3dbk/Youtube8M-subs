what<00:00:01.860> we're<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.159> do<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.610> look<00:00:02.879> at<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
what we're going to do is look at the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.330 
what we're going to do is look at the
difference<00:00:03.600> between<00:00:03.980> cooking<00:00:04.980> with<00:00:05.490> regular

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
difference between cooking with regular

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.250 
difference between cooking with regular
old-fashioned<00:00:08.340> range<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.120> an<00:00:09.960> induction

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
old-fashioned range and an induction

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.379 
old-fashioned range and an induction
cooktop<00:00:10.730> so<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.090> do<00:00:12.210> today

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
cooktop so what we're going to do today

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.539 
cooktop so what we're going to do today
is<00:00:13.019> focus<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.830> happens<00:00:14.160> when<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> cook

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is focus on what happens when you cook

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.210 
is focus on what happens when you cook
it<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> regular<00:00:15.089> conventional<00:00:15.719> range<00:00:16.320> what

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
it on a regular conventional range what

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.490 
it on a regular conventional range what
we've<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> GE<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.960> want<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> show

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
we've got is a GE if you want to show

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.700 
we've got is a GE if you want to show
that<00:00:19.710> money<00:00:19.949> we've<00:00:20.789> got<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> GE<00:00:21.300> range<00:00:21.869> that's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that money we've got a GE range that's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.929 
that money we've got a GE range that's
maybe<00:00:23.070> three<00:00:23.519> years<00:00:24.269> old<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.519> has<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
maybe three years old and it has this

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.710 
maybe three years old and it has this
glass<00:00:27.779> cooktop<00:00:28.279> which<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.519> told<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.240> about

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
glass cooktop which we're told is about

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.110 
glass cooktop which we're told is about
as<00:00:30.900> efficient<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.309> old-fashioned<00:00:33.059> kind

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
as efficient as the old-fashioned kind

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
as efficient as the old-fashioned kind
with<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> radiant<00:00:34.320> elements<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.790> just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
with the radiant elements so I'm just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.770 
with the radiant elements so I'm just
going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> pull<00:00:36.450> back<00:00:36.719> our<00:00:37.730> large<00:00:38.730> cast<00:00:39.510> iron

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

going to pull back our large cast iron
skillet<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> cabinet<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.570> on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
skillet out of the cabinet put it on

this<00:00:42.870> man<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.379> set

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this man I that we use and I'm gonna set

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.360 
this man I that we use and I'm gonna set
it<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> range<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:49.190> 0<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:52.070> guess<00:00:53.070> an

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it from on a range of 0 to I guess an

hi<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.800> set<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.280> 8<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.780> see

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hi I'm gonna set it on 8 and you can see

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.720 
hi I'm gonna set it on 8 and you can see
here<00:01:01.289> what's<00:01:01.530> happening<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here what's happening here is that as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
here what's happening here is that as
the<00:01:03.090> element<00:01:03.629> heats<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.439> heat<00:01:04.710> up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the element heats up it's gonna heat up

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
the element heats up it's gonna heat up
that<00:01:05.129> skillet<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> heats<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.720> very

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that skillet but it heats it up very

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.289 
that skillet but it heats it up very
slowly<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:07.920> I'm<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.119> olive

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
slowly now I'm gonna go get some olive

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.800 
slowly now I'm gonna go get some olive
oil<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:14.340> cooking<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.420> fried<00:01:15.780> egg

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
oil what we're cooking is a fried egg

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.249 
oil what we're cooking is a fried egg
for<00:01:16.350> Amanda<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.479> scrambled<00:01:18.479> egg<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.900> me<00:01:19.020> with

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
for Amanda and scrambled egg for me with

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.719 
for Amanda and scrambled egg for me with
a<00:01:19.290> little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> veggies<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.460> cheese

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
a little bit of veggies and some cheese

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.749 
a little bit of veggies and some cheese
and<00:01:21.090> oh<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> didn't<00:01:29.310> notice<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.729> we

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
and oh and I didn't notice when we

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
and oh and I didn't notice when we
turned<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.479> probably<00:01:30.659> been<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.320> now

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
turned it on it's probably been on now

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
turned it on it's probably been on now
for<00:01:31.890> maybe<00:01:32.390> 15-20<00:01:33.390> seconds<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.520> okay

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
for maybe 15-20 seconds and it is okay

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.389 
for maybe 15-20 seconds and it is okay
I'm<00:01:38.579> gonna<00:01:38.700> note<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.979> 7:47<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.159> I'm

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.820 

when<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> turned<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.530 

doesn't<00:01:48.460> look<00:01:48.549> like<00:01:48.610> it's<00:01:48.940> quite<00:01:49.210> ready<00:01:49.450> for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
doesn't look like it's quite ready for

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.390 
doesn't look like it's quite ready for
the<00:01:49.720> edge<00:01:49.869> for<00:01:50.140> something<00:01:50.440> what<00:01:50.950> I'm<00:01:51.070> looking

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
the edge for something what I'm looking

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.030 
the edge for something what I'm looking
forward<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.760> know<00:01:51.940> what<00:01:52.150> it's<00:01:52.270> time<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:53.040> put

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
forward to know what it's time to put

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.399 
forward to know what it's time to put
the<00:01:54.159> egg<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:54.850> for<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.270> oil<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.869> sort<00:01:56.350> of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
the egg on is for the oil to sort of

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.300 
the egg on is for the oil to sort of
spread<00:01:56.680> out<00:01:56.800> on<00:01:57.159> its<00:01:57.340> own<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:02.470> induction

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
spread out on its own the induction

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.480 
spread out on its own the induction
cooktop<00:02:03.970> doesn't<00:02:04.869> use<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.770> lot<00:02:06.460> less

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
cooktop doesn't use a lot less

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.729 
cooktop doesn't use a lot less
electricity<00:02:07.240> than<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.860> radiant<00:02:09.369> element

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
electricity than the radiant element

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.470 
electricity than the radiant element
it's<00:02:11.739> just<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.430> uses<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.270> much

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
it's just that it uses it for a much

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's just that it uses it for a much
shorter<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.310> probably<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
shorter time and this is probably the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:24.780 
shorter time and this is probably the
best<00:02:16.380> illustration<00:02:23.130> would<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.310> well<00:02:24.519> along

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
best illustration would be well along

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.150 
best illustration would be well along
its<00:02:25.600> way<00:02:25.870> by<00:02:26.110> now<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.590> I'm<00:02:26.680> gonna<00:02:26.860> put<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.100> in

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
its way by now and I'm gonna put this in

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.350 
its way by now and I'm gonna put this in
here<00:02:27.489> and<00:02:27.519> I<00:02:27.610> bet<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:27.910> gonna<00:02:28.030> be<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.239> little

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
here and I bet it's gonna be a little

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630 
here and I bet it's gonna be a little
coup<00:02:28.690> yeah<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.709> little<00:02:29.920> cool<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.489> egg

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
coup yeah it's a little cool for the egg

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.750 
coup yeah it's a little cool for the egg
right<00:02:30.970> now<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.769> see<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.160> being<00:02:33.430> it's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
right now as you can see it's being it's

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.690 
right now as you can see it's being it's
it's<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:34.510> cool<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:41.440> I'm<00:02:41.590> sort<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.519> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it's all cool but I'm sort of out of the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:57.530 
it's all cool but I'm sort of out of the
habit<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.060> using<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:47.340> judge<00:02:48.340> them<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.720> Amanda

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.350 

actually<00:02:58.540> she<00:02:58.720> likes<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:59.049> lot<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.530> peppers<00:03:00.239> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.430 

now<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.660> wait<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> second

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
now I'm going to wait for a second

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.380 
now I'm going to wait for a second
because<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.430> got<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:06.820> cooking<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> do

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
because it's it's got some cooking to do

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.060 
because it's it's got some cooking to do
before<00:03:07.750> we're<00:03:07.870> ready<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.170> turn<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.739> put<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
before we're ready to turn it I put the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.490 
before we're ready to turn it I put the
egg<00:03:09.250> in<00:03:09.430> too<00:03:09.610> soon<00:03:09.930> should<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.049> waited<00:03:11.140> even

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
egg in too soon should have waited even

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:20.250 
egg in too soon should have waited even
longer<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.920> put<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.190> in

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.199 

I'm<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.890> real<00:03:21.040> man<00:03:21.069> I'll<00:03:21.459> figure<00:03:21.670> out<00:03:21.879> how<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.060> do

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.530 
I'm a real man I'll figure out how to do
one<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.390> those<00:03:22.540> time<00:03:22.840> passes<00:03:23.410> things<00:03:23.440> but<00:03:24.540> okay

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
one of those time passes things but okay

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.410 
one of those time passes things but okay
it's<00:03:25.720> some<00:03:28.230> 748<00:03:29.230> now<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.430> guess<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.180> been

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
it's some 748 now I guess so it's been

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.119 
it's some 748 now I guess so it's been
in<00:03:31.599> there<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.879> well<00:03:33.879> we'll<00:03:34.030> figure<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.420> out

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
in there for well we'll figure that out

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.800 
in there for well we'll figure that out
we'll<00:03:36.129> probably<00:03:36.310> flash<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.269> on<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.480> screen

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
we'll probably flash it on the screen

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.060 
we'll probably flash it on the screen
how<00:03:38.080> long<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.560> been<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.800> at<00:03:39.099> this<00:03:39.220> point<00:03:41.550> and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
how long it's been in at this point and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.589 
how long it's been in at this point and
[Music]

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
[Music]

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.509 
[Music]
yeah<00:03:46.599> whatever<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.500> do<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:48.010> honey<00:03:48.250> don't

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
yeah whatever you do then honey don't

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:57.660 
yeah whatever you do then honey don't
let<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.970> stop<00:03:49.299> just<00:03:50.170> let<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.440> keep<00:03:50.590> rolling<00:03:56.670> see

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
let it stop just let it keep rolling see

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.660 
let it stop just let it keep rolling see
that<00:03:58.290> middle<00:03:59.290> area<00:03:59.440> there<00:03:59.860> aren't<00:04:00.640> enough

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
that middle area there aren't enough

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:18.900 
that middle area there aren't enough
you're<00:04:01.030> probably<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.329> little<00:04:01.450> close<00:04:17.910> sooner

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you're probably a little close sooner

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:29.240 
you're probably a little close sooner
than<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.239> there<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.950> looks<00:04:20.950> good

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.940 

and<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.340> course<00:04:30.550> it's<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.690> heating<00:04:32.139> up<00:04:32.289> as

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
and of course it's it's heating up as

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.940 
and of course it's it's heating up as
all<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.760> happening<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.380> my<00:04:35.380> egg<00:04:35.620> my

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
all of this is happening so my egg my

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.450 
all of this is happening so my egg my
scrambled<00:04:36.460> eggs<00:04:36.669> gonna<00:04:36.880> cook<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.120> lot<00:04:37.300> faster

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
scrambled eggs gonna cook a lot faster

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.870 
scrambled eggs gonna cook a lot faster
then<00:04:40.530> Amanda<00:04:43.770> since<00:04:44.770> we're<00:04:45.010> using<00:04:45.039> this

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
then Amanda since we're using this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.870 
then Amanda since we're using this
anyway<00:04:46.660> then<00:04:47.050> set<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.440> warming<00:04:48.010> zone<00:04:48.340> which

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
anyway then set the warming zone which

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.940 
anyway then set the warming zone which
we<00:04:49.090> don't<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.570> with<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.990> induction<00:04:50.260> cooktop

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
we don't have with the induction cooktop

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.150 
we don't have with the induction cooktop
ah<00:04:51.360> let<00:04:52.360> me<00:04:52.510> just<00:04:53.020> back<00:04:53.260> up<00:04:53.320> because<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.950> won't

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
ah let me just back up because it won't

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.750 
ah let me just back up because it won't
yeah<00:04:55.320> but<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:56.440> did<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> separate<00:04:57.340> warming

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
yeah but I just did a separate warming

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.670 
yeah but I just did a separate warming
zone<00:04:58.000> which<00:04:58.840> is<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:59.169> little<00:04:59.470> thing<00:04:59.650> right

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
zone which is this little thing right

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.610 
zone which is this little thing right
here<00:04:59.950> which<00:05:00.460> will<00:05:01.389> keep<00:05:01.419> Amanda's<00:05:02.050> egg<00:05:02.200> warm

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
here which will keep Amanda's egg warm

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.350 
here which will keep Amanda's egg warm
while<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:02.889> cook<00:05:03.550> mine<00:05:03.729> that's<00:05:04.060> one<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.270> those

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
while I cook mine that's one of those

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.580 
while I cook mine that's one of those
conveniences<00:05:04.780> we're<00:05:05.440> about<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.800> give<00:05:05.950> up<00:05:09.690> okay

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.610 

now<00:05:14.590> Amanda's<00:05:15.340> egg<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.760> done<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:17.050> here's<00:05:17.380> mine

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
now Amanda's egg is done and here's mine

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.189 
now Amanda's egg is done and here's mine
already<00:05:17.979> mixed<00:05:18.430> up

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.629 

and<00:05:22.199> that's<00:05:22.409> more<00:05:22.620> likely<00:05:22.860> temperature<00:05:23.460> you

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
and that's more likely temperature you

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:47.800 
and that's more likely temperature you
wanna<00:05:23.879> hang<00:05:24.090> out<00:05:24.120> here<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.229> table<00:05:25.409> instead

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.240 

that<00:05:48.810> won't<00:05:49.020> be<00:05:49.200> long<00:05:49.440> before<00:05:49.680> I'll<00:05:50.010> be<00:05:50.130> able

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
that won't be long before I'll be able

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.120 
that won't be long before I'll be able
to<00:05:50.370> turn<00:05:50.640> this<00:05:50.820> off<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.330> we<00:05:51.480> long<00:05:54.920> we'll<00:05:55.920> figure

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
to turn this off so we long we'll figure

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.700 
to turn this off so we long we'll figure
that<00:05:56.370> out<00:05:56.540> probably<00:05:57.540> after<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:58.080> flip<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.410> one

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
that out probably after I flip it one

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.170 
that out probably after I flip it one
time<00:05:58.920> we'll<00:05:59.250> be<00:05:59.400> able<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.760> turn<00:05:59.970> the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
time we'll be able to turn the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:21.980 
time we'll be able to turn the
frying-pan<00:06:02.060> element<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:20.370> now<00:06:20.630> whatever<00:06:21.630> time

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
frying-pan element so now whatever time

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.620 
frying-pan element so now whatever time
I<00:06:22.170> turned<00:06:22.710> it<00:06:22.890> off<00:06:23.010> that's<00:06:23.370> that's<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:24.150> the

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
I turned it off that's that's the the

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:32.890 
I turned it off that's that's the the
time<00:06:24.930> elapsed<00:06:26.210> or<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.510> radiant<00:06:28.190> element

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.740
