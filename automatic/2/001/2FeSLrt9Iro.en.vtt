 Let's do a cake, yes, something like that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.719
 is also vegan and above all, yes, we 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 the theme is almost always 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.200
 times come video vegan does not mean 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 waive yes we really have here 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.609
 close 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 Of course, that's not something 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.000
 So people are healthy when you really are healthy 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150
 then did not want to eat something like that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 you need the video completely different 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 You have to be unhealthy every now and then 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 can be there is simply delicious 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 So what do we need so everything first 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710

 I have my pace in here I came 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 already here at the start 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.280

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.280

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.530
 until 200 came so we need that 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.530
 do not weigh yet 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:35.720
 So we start the excavator 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.810
 then there are 50 grams of grated coconut 5 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.160

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:24.980

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.530

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.580
 form a patch with it 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.500

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.250
 Do a simple baking paper doing that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.620
 Baking paper already torn is there must 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.900
 I take a new one yes we do 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.370

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.090
 mix everything through 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.400
 so that the whole thing is ready for the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.220
 oven systems at 180 degrees 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.190
 180 degrees air circulation here is the whole day 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.320
 now at the start 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.940
 Are you the theft after me? 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.950

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.950
 Tastes raw tastes like that ok 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.480
 know so now I look again 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:06.400
 because of the baking paper I have you 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.810
 so made baking paper so well 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.700
 as I said here I usually 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.310
 enough fat in it but that is not even 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.200
 really even healthy fat needs 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.739
 you say so just once since I have to 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.850
 personally not in berlin reinbold 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.660
 but as I said, it is theirs 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.759
 leave 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.319
 as it likes 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.690
 Do it the way you want, I try 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.470
 just keep up with the material 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.470
 compensate 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.250
 that's what the whole spoon looks like starting up 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:43.659
 instead of or we can do it all 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.659
 paintings still the last rest 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.790
 so that was happy the cake is ready 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.990
 that looks like yes as I said 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.620
 Dough tastes perverted 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.920

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.650

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.490
