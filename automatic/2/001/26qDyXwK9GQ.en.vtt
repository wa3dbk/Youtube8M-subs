the e 1200 B and then 14 on the G I'm
going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> finish<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> by<00:01:57.990> bending<00:01:58.350> 15<00:01:59.039> on<00:01:59.340> the

going to finish it by bending 15 on the
B<00:01:59.759> string<00:01:59.819> with<00:02:01.130> some<00:02:02.130> vibrato<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:03.119> together

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
B string with some vibrato all together

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:18.619 
B string with some vibrato all together
slowly<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.700> also<00:02:18.299> well

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
slowly there you have it also well

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.180 
slowly there you have it also well
another<00:02:18.780> thing<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> break<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.010> loop

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
another thing is going to break the loop

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
another thing is going to break the loop
into<00:02:20.459> two<00:02:20.640> separate<00:02:20.970> parts<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:21.450> practiced<00:02:21.900> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
into two separate parts so practiced as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:33.259 
into two separate parts so practiced as
far<00:02:22.530> as<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:25.700> second<00:02:26.700> pause<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.760> way<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
far as this second pause it that way it

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.059 
far as this second pause it that way it
helps<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.810> join<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.170> lip<00:02:34.349> together<00:02:34.739> and

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
helps you to join the lip together and

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.229 
helps you to join the lip together and
have<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> smoothness<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
have the smoothness can you back the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.880 
have the smoothness can you back the
sweet<00:02:36.420> picky<00:02:36.720> part<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.650> do

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
sweet picky part that you can do

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.979 
sweet picky part that you can do
separately<00:02:38.540> develop<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.660> get<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
separately develop that get the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.300 
separately develop that get the
smoothness<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.739> first<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
smoothness on that first and the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
smoothness on that first and the
alternate<00:02:41.910> picking<00:02:42.090> prior<00:02:42.359> develop<00:02:43.109> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
alternate picking prior develop that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
alternate picking prior develop that
separately<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.220> then<00:02:44.489> what<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.879> play

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
separately and then what you can play

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.819 
separately and then what you can play
them<00:02:45.239> both<00:02:45.389> reasonably<00:02:46.019> well<00:02:46.170> practice<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
them both reasonably well practice it

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.520 
them both reasonably well practice it
together<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.400> slowly<00:02:47.930> get<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.049> smoothness

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
together but slowly get the smoothness

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.259 
together but slowly get the smoothness
so<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.709> can<00:02:49.829> go<00:02:49.920> between<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.639> sweet<00:02:50.910> picking

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
so you can go between the sweet picking

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.330 
so you can go between the sweet picking
and<00:02:51.510> alternate<00:02:52.019> picking<00:02:52.230> where<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.160> don't

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and alternate picking where you don't

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.640 
and alternate picking where you don't
have<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.579> change<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.150> speed<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.139> wanna<00:02:55.530> keep

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
have a change in speed so you wanna keep

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.309 
have a change in speed so you wanna keep
the<00:02:55.769> time<00:02:56.010> nice<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.459> level<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:56.880> yeah<00:02:57.870> keep

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
the time nice and level and yeah keep

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.080 
the time nice and level and yeah keep
playing<00:02:58.530> slowly<00:02:58.950> let<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.549> speed<00:02:59.849> come

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
playing slowly let the speed come

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.510 
playing slowly let the speed come
actually
