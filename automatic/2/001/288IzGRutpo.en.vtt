thing<00:00:18.660> i<00:00:18.750> want<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> go<00:00:19.109> over<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.650> ease<00:00:19.920> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
thing i want to go over is the ease of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
thing i want to go over is the ease of
the<00:00:20.250> installation<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.090> found<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.750> actually

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the installation I found this actually

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
the installation I found this actually
pretty<00:00:22.350> easy<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.830> install<00:00:23.010> compared<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
pretty easy to install compared to the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.259 
pretty easy to install compared to the
zagg<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> iphone<00:00:25.590> 4<00:00:25.949> maybe<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
zagg for the iphone 4 maybe it's the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939 
zagg for the iphone 4 maybe it's the
difference<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.720> devices<00:00:28.050> makes<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.619> easier

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
difference in devices makes it easier

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009 
difference in devices makes it easier
i'm<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.429> sure<00:00:29.760> but<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.869> ease<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
i'm not sure but the ease of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.799 
i'm not sure but the ease of
installation<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:33.210> nice<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
installation was really really nice it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.170 
installation was really really nice it
went<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.050> pretty<00:00:34.230> quick<00:00:34.500> i<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> was

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
went on pretty quick i think it was

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.950 
went on pretty quick i think it was
maybe<00:00:36.410> 5-10<00:00:37.410> minutes<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.670> put<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.000> really

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
maybe 5-10 minutes to put on really

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
maybe 5-10 minutes to put on really
under<00:00:40.410> 10<00:00:40.590> minutes<00:00:40.710> i<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
under 10 minutes i think to put it on

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.440 
under 10 minutes i think to put it on
but<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> little<00:00:43.230> uh<00:00:43.910> squeegeeing<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
but a little uh squeegeeing out the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.290 
but a little uh squeegeeing out the
leftover<00:00:46.260> bubbles<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> end<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.489> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
leftover bubbles at the end there but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.049 
leftover bubbles at the end there but
ease<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.780> installation<00:00:48.899> was<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:50.309> nice<00:00:50.520> one

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
ease of installation was really nice one

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.200 
ease of installation was really nice one
thing<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> didn't<00:00:52.350> like<00:00:53.250> about<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.030> was

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
thing I what I didn't like about it was

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.560 
thing I what I didn't like about it was
the<00:00:55.010> pieces<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> sides<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.149> diagram

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the pieces for the sides the diagram

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
the pieces for the sides the diagram
they<00:00:57.719> gave<00:00:57.960> me<00:00:58.170> showed<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.800> showed<00:00:59.489> five

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
they gave me showed that showed five

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
they gave me showed that showed five
pieces<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> sides<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:02.129> actually

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
pieces for the sides and they actually

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.950 
pieces for the sides and they actually
and<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.180> had<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and what they actually had in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.280 
and what they actually had in the
package<00:01:04.350> had<00:01:04.920> six<00:01:05.519> pieces<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.900> pieces

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
package had six pieces and the pieces

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.429 
package had six pieces and the pieces
died<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.130> had<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.090> went<00:01:09.479> by<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> diagram<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
died I had I went by the diagram and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
died I had I went by the diagram and
they<00:01:11.100> didn't<00:01:11.400> seem<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.880> cover<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.229> way

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
they didn't seem to cover all the way

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.120 
they didn't seem to cover all the way
around<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.680> side<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:15.090> diagram<00:01:15.659> showed

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
around the side as their diagram showed

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
around the side as their diagram showed
so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.549> left<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.439> empty<00:01:19.439> spot<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
so I was left a empty spot on I think it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.649 
so I was left a empty spot on I think it
was<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> bottom<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> iPad<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.450> was<00:01:24.450> not

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
was the bottom of the iPad there was not

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.580 
was the bottom of the iPad there was not
covered<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.299> as<00:01:27.299> far<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> front<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
covered and then as far as the front and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
covered and then as far as the front and
back<00:01:28.710> covers<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.549> seem<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> cutouts

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
back covers they seem like the cutouts

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
back covers they seem like the cutouts
where<00:01:30.540> maybe<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:31.170> by<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.680> hair<00:01:31.890> not

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
where maybe we're off by just a hair not

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940 
where maybe we're off by just a hair not
too<00:01:32.490> bad<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> hair<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.710> far<00:01:34.890> as

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
too bad but just a hair but as far as

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.420 
too bad but just a hair but as far as
the<00:01:35.159> protection<00:01:35.670> goes<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:38.040> really<00:01:38.250> nice

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the protection goes it was really nice

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.880 
the protection goes it was really nice
as<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> video<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.869> i<00:01:40.020> have
