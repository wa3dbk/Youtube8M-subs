 josh valley and dance I do like 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 because it's labyrinthine and I like it 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
 people like us on the roads and I think 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 that I do not either but I like it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.990
 like this screen to turn off 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 randomly to levy in one of the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 all two the two of them all and they are two 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 two or three good I know well I 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.039
 I know them well because I know her very well and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390
 I'm seeing that people are pretty 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.969
 good especially the first two that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.620
 they have more than two thousand and one together mother 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.420
 of good god let's see today we have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.559
 luck the last time without more not remembering 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 if you do not have here below description 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 good was the last chaos of 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.379
 the races come see if there are now 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 more luck we have a pair of gods 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 in front of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 I went out last because it's the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.670
 last to come true is not a little 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.550
 wrong 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.949
 good well good well perfect perfect 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.539
 up on top not worth no 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.789
 to have played there no longer played 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.559
 in the area of ​​lost speed at 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.640
 touch me at the outset of the law or if I 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.640
 it seems good that you get there 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.369
 I'm not with turbo now no 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 there's the la llevais take a double 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.400
 blow given the one of the bomb and that's fine 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 perfect 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.880
 in these times the people above the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 truth there are not calculated the times well 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.350
 maybe it's faster down below but 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.890
 should not should not because normally 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.690
 the good ones the most complicated do not come 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 look look who 's big look who's 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.170
 it was and the loss protection seems to me 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.439
 I was wearing 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.869
 platanitos yes because it's in front oysters 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.600
 oysters is good is good and I think that 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.060
 I have the other behind I think I have the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.190
 another that is good behind more than 2,000 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.460
 now perfect game points to the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.320
 very good on 8th the 8th of the 8th or the 8th 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.990
 infinite as you want to say it we will see 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.270
 to see if I do not like that I did not want 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.019
 confused and I'm going to give me ok no 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.730
 It's worth just catching turbo without skidding 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.590
 I do not know if it 's normal the truth look at this one 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.260
 I thought to give this one we are going to catch this 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.730
 perfect shot he gave perfect 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.110
 take off I'm breaking the train and everything 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 ok let's catch this before not what 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.459
 do not need it but that way we avoid that 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.769
 fuck you behind, okay, I'll go over here 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.319
 on the left because it seems that 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.580
 it is better if it should be better because as 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.769
 you catch the turbales you follow and much better 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.319
 My mom, it's the first time I'm going 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.760
 there I'm going to reserve all this because 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.760
 what you need the last round that is 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.310
 this mother of mine, my mother, my mother, what 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.040
 ok let's go 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.870
 mother of god I do not play it down 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.080
 that the first two have gone well 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.849
 times more here the turbo the skid the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.400
 turbo perfect good good good 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.709
 good in eggs behind that yes in the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.769
 moment they throw me something we're going to roll 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.769
 the fat one is fine 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.910
 this is the use of luck is on 8 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 luck came to the middle of the game 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.660
 with him ok let's go here rather turn 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.930
 ok and I'm not going to skid here because 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.120
 I want 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.469
 my mother, I'm still with people from behind like this 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.250
 that very carefully very carefully 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.599
 very carefully I'm going to skid 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.700
 although maybe I should go straight and 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.620
 use the turbo but I do not want to play 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 there goes the turbo there goes the turbo there 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.060
 the game 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 but it moves me right at the end 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.220
 my care 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.120

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.090
 oh my god 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.500
 Today I wanted to vote, it's worth it 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.659
 it seems that he's going to play mario 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.659
 because several our imaginary friend 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.230
 ok if he plays mario yes or yes let's see 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.820
 let's see where these two ugly are 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.270
 they have come now as they are 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.310
 Germans are jade mannings alliance sans 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.350
 Chance for sale is worth and the two French 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.330
 they're still here but I'm going there or there 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.240
 to really graze the gods 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.310
 outside it's worth something second because it's 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.350
 second the previous screen in the 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.990
 previous circuit we go there 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.490
 we accelerate so let's take no has 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.590
 come out wind although I have more 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.850
 acceleration seems to be if I have more 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:27.140
 acceleration let's put turbo well by 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.140
 here perfect and we will go here 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:36.110
 never before the truth that high good 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.620
 I like that you touch me here because 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.620
 asked for speed 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:47.870
 I'm not friends with the piranha plant 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.790
 carnivorous is because you eat red 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.860
 I think 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.550
 right now it's just that balance in 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.860
 As soon as I touch ground, I throw it 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.690
 not only throws because it has protection 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.160
 anti cavity protection for her not the 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.440
 have so we're going to tease you there 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.230
 and we go in turbo and closing the curve 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.400
 The effect 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:15.220
 and we go around here and perfect we go out with 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.660
 this and we take coins that I think 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.610
 it seems silly the truth that 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.710
 It works a lot and gives us a lot 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.330
 speed so let's go over there 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.850
 well guys I remind you that you have 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.620

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.930
 water but if you want to add me if 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.500
 we played some day then added to all the 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.389
 world to the water 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.919

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.190
 OK 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:43.139
 so we're going there all at once 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:50.430

 no no no no perfect I'm not spilling 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.439
 because I have my finger on the trigger 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.620
 because I thought I was going to touch something 

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:04.620
 to protect 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.930
 throw those things 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:20.009
 Andalusia Looks Looks Looks Already When 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:22.529
