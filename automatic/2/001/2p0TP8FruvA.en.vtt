few ways to work with this I'm going to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
few ways to work with this I'm going to
go<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:41.219> perspective<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.750> will<00:00:42.989> read

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
go into perspective now it will read

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.209 
go into perspective now it will read
your<00:00:43.440> lens<00:00:43.680> profile<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.890> see<00:00:46.890> how<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
your lens profile if you see how this

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
your lens profile if you see how this
fixed<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> automatically<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.660> itself<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.140> read

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
fixed it automatically by itself it read

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
fixed it automatically by itself it read
the<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.590> metadata<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> lens<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> says

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
the the metadata on the lens and says

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
the the metadata on the lens and says
okay<00:00:51.660> based<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> lens<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.559> fix<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
okay based on that lens we can fix it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.950 
okay based on that lens we can fix it
then<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:53.969> scale<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.660> scale<00:00:54.719> it

maybe<00:01:55.160> I'll<00:01:55.310> slide<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:55.910> over<00:01:56.120> a<00:01:56.330> little<00:01:56.510> bit

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.270 

so<00:01:59.930> now<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.290> have<00:02:00.410> everything<00:02:00.740> squared

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
so now that we have everything squared

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.250 
so now that we have everything squared
the<00:02:01.400> way<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.640> want<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:01.970> we<00:02:02.660> can<00:02:02.810> change<00:02:03.080> how

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
the way we want it we can change how

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.280 
the way we want it we can change how
it's<00:02:03.440> cropped<00:02:04.270> okay<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.870> crop<00:02:06.080> factor

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
it's cropped okay the crop factor

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.310 
it's cropped okay the crop factor
actually<00:02:06.650> has<00:02:07.550> an<00:02:07.790> effect<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.390> geometry

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually has an effect on the geometry

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.670 
actually has an effect on the geometry
of<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.530> building<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.810> look<00:02:14.990> at

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
of the building we can look at

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.380 
of the building we can look at
not<00:02:16.299> here<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:24.170> maybe

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
not here and maybe

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.559 
not here and maybe
back<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.080> hair<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.560> move<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.130> over<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
back just a hair and move it over it's a

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.090 
back just a hair and move it over it's a
pretty<00:02:31.780> interesting<00:02:32.050> tool<00:02:32.470> now<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.069> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
pretty interesting tool now this is a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.040 
pretty interesting tool now this is a
simple<00:02:33.520> way<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.819> I've<00:02:33.940> used<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:34.959> going

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
simple way that I've used it we're going

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.260 
simple way that I've used it we're going
to<00:02:35.110> click<00:02:35.260> okay<00:02:38.400> let<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.550> crunch<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
to click okay let this crunch the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.020 
to click okay let this crunch the
numbers<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.780> apply<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> look<00:02:45.850> at<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
numbers and apply it take a look at the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.930 
numbers and apply it take a look at the
difference<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> two<00:02:46.810> images<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.820> hand<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
difference of the two images and hand it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.680 
difference of the two images and hand it
back<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> Lightroom<00:02:53.610> ok<00:02:54.610> there's<00:02:54.910> after

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
back to Lightroom ok there's after

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.140 
back to Lightroom ok there's after
there's<00:02:56.650> before<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.459> there's<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.700> considerable

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
there's before so there's a considerable

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.690 
there's before so there's a considerable
difference<00:02:59.040> this<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.489> bit<00:03:00.580> more

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
difference this is a little bit more

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.979 
difference this is a little bit more
interesting<00:03:01.120> looking<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.600> doesn't<00:03:01.870> look

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
interesting looking if it doesn't look

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.740 
interesting looking if it doesn't look
so<00:03:02.170> distorted<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.370> we'll<00:03:03.519> hit<00:03:03.610> ctrl<00:03:04.150> s<00:03:04.450> or

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
so distorted so we'll hit ctrl s or

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.320 
so distorted so we'll hit ctrl s or
command<00:03:05.170> s<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.440> save<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.790> see<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.060> starts

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
command s to save you see it starts

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.570 
command s to save you see it starts
saving<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> file<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:09.130> will<00:03:09.190> hand<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.550> back

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
saving the file and it will hand it back

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.560 
saving the file and it will hand it back
into<00:03:10.060> Lightroom<00:03:11.730> I'll<00:03:12.730> pause<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.239> for<00:03:13.330> one

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
into Lightroom I'll pause just for one

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.910 
into Lightroom I'll pause just for one
second<00:03:14.019> let<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.380> finish<00:03:16.410> there<00:03:17.410> we<00:03:17.620> are<00:03:17.769> we're

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
second let it finish there we are we're

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.940 
second let it finish there we are we're
back<00:03:17.950> inside<00:03:18.550> Lightroom<00:03:19.470> let<00:03:20.470> me<00:03:20.560> pull<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
back inside Lightroom let me pull that

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.080 
back inside Lightroom let me pull that
back<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.940> there's<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.050> file<00:03:24.000> simple<00:03:25.000> as

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
back up and there's the file simple as

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.270 
back up and there's the file simple as
that<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.440> think<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.709> offer<00:03:26.830> take<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> time

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
that so I think you offer take the time

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.280 
that so I think you offer take the time
to<00:03:27.430> visit<00:03:27.730> today<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.180> until<00:03:28.660> next<00:03:28.780> time<00:03:28.930> we'll

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
to visit today and until next time we'll

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.709 
to visit today and until next time we'll
see<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.530> soon
