animation
yeah<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.490> been<00:00:17.640> stepping<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.600> scene

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
yeah I've been stepping it up that scene

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.810 
yeah I've been stepping it up that scene
in<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> beginning<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.890> episode<00:00:20.310> opens<00:00:20.460> up

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in the beginning the episode opens up

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.490 
in the beginning the episode opens up
and<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.240> until<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.930> 10<00:00:22.199> minute<00:00:22.470> mark

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and is not until like the 10 minute mark

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.009 
and is not until like the 10 minute mark
that<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> stops<00:00:23.220> means<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.670> completely<00:00:24.330> epic

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
that it stops means is completely epic

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
that it stops means is completely epic
for<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> moment<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.760> 10

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
for the moment because the first like 10

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.400 
for the moment because the first like 10
minutes<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> course<00:00:27.869> including<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
minutes or so of course including the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.810 
minutes or so of course including the
opening<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.830> whatever<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
opening or whatever but and well it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.890 
opening or whatever but and well it
looks<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> 10<00:00:30.359> minute<00:00:30.390> mark<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
looks like a 10 minute mark that I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
looks like a 10 minute mark that I
realized<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> scene<00:00:31.740> had<00:00:31.949> stopped

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
realized that the scene had stopped

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
realized that the scene had stopped
because<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.210> goddamn<00:00:33.690> epic<00:00:34.170> where

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
because it was so goddamn epic where

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.610 
because it was so goddamn epic where
fujitora<00:00:35.280> uses<00:00:36.149> his<00:00:36.329> powers<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> he<00:00:37.260> freakin

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
fujitora uses his powers and he freakin

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160 
fujitora uses his powers and he freakin
blows<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> ground<00:00:38.940> whatever<00:00:39.540> power<00:00:39.989> he

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
blows up the ground whatever power he

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
blows up the ground whatever power he
was<00:00:40.260> using<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.590> guessing<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.309> like

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
was using I'm guessing it's to do like

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
was using I'm guessing it's to do like
gravity<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.059> stuff<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.260> just

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
gravity and stuff like that and you just

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
gravity and stuff like that and you just
see<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> three<00:00:43.890> pillars<00:00:44.160> there<00:00:44.489> with

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
see the three pillars there with

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.260 
see the three pillars there with
doflamingo<00:00:45.420> law<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> fujitora<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
