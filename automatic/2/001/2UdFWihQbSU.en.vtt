00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.709 
down yourself and then once you have
done<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> open<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.030> generator<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
done that go and open this generator and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.799 
done that go and open this generator and
zap<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.410> unreleased<00:00:35.040> double<00:00:35.550> XP<00:00:36.000> which

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
zap it then unreleased double XP which

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
off that chain right there but at this

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.149 
off that chain right there but at this
moment<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> next<00:01:19.409> pile<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
moment it is not so the next pile bit is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
moment it is not so the next pile bit is
through<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> door<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.119> right<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
through this door then right down at the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.380 
through this door then right down at the
end<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:24.210> are

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
end which it is really easy these are

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
end which it is really easy these are
the<00:01:24.450> only<00:01:24.570> two<00:01:24.689> spots<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.470> end<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.770> being

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the only two spots it will end up being

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
the only two spots it will end up being
on<00:01:26.640> solar<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.750> multiplayer<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
on solar and even on multiplayer so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.630 
on solar and even on multiplayer so
logically<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> ones<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> key<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
logically the ones in key is there so

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
logically the ones in key is there so
all<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> now<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.659> down

all you have to do now is just down

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
all you have to do now is just down
yourself<00:01:31.439> once<00:01:31.680> again<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> go
