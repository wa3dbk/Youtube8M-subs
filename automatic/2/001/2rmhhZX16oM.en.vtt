00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hi guys, I'm going to review this base today. 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 Here for you, a sweetheart, there you are. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.170
 everybody talking about her already the time since 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.170
 that it was launched which is base touch of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.509
 nature that has this basis that I 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.630
 I bought it in September from Uncle Hill I paid 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 my r $ 35 it 's just that I was 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.550
 long time no use I do not know why 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
 I left there in the corner I do not know if I 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.810
 was not applying the right 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 I wore I wore it and I did not wear it. 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.369
 I liked the texture and was not 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.620
 I liked the finish of it and I started to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 being annoyed offered to know 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 I will not go that base anymore when 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.719
 I want to use it there I left it there 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 singing for months and at the end of the month 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.670
 last March I started to use March 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 It will not calm tomorrow, April 1st. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 So February, I'm terrible. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.949
 for the terrible day for all this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.949
 very lost in the time when I 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.680
 I started using it and I have really liked it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.530
 She's turning her head around like this. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 now its use she then I saw review 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 she here to you 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 The packaging of it is due is matte and has 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 This is a clinical day here and the bread 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 that I left a quantity like this 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 reasonable as it comes out that bread so that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.380
 giant that you can not control 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.420
 know came the need for you to apply 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.759
 on your face the whole tutorial of this 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 makeup will scroll on the blog the photos 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.930
 state the step by step of the makeup well 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 simple using a rope all his mother 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 so you only have to click on this link here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.619
 that you go straight to the producer 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 she had people knocking on my common 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 home already this way would be the video late 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.640
 work 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'll start the application and I'll put 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.890
 two points here in my mom's pocket 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.860
 I'll apply with this brush here is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.860
 flattened did not happen to him in the face 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.469
 so we can see the coverage of the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.700
 base as well as how it covers the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.789
 people, so I did not want to move to that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 base it has no heavy coverage 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.690
 her coverage 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.220
 the average you can build layers is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.400
 very smooth 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.250
 She's not that creamy, she knows it 's a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.870
 little it is not too liquid but also 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.570
 it's not that the voice is too much so 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 When you spread it, it gets kind of a queen. 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.910
 in the face 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.160
 so it does not cover so much face 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.680
 she is good for day to day is oil free 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.380
 oil level so it fits the skin 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.720
 oily and even having argan oil 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.060
 which gives a little distress s 9 has oil 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.550
 from argan she must be loyal marginal pink 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.550
 she gets dry on her face and she lasts 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.100
 quite she does not last all day style 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.959
 it is not long-lasting but it can 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.870
 Make you quiet for the weaker hours 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.970
 so I came by and I'll pay you 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.540
 more for my face 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.330
 I thought she left my face a 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.410
 little pink today has become a bit 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.050
 used for me but the other was already 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.600
 too dark 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.709
 This is number 3 if I'm not mistaken. 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.050
 the number 3 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.989
 like I told you she does not cover 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.830
 much looks the aviamento quite scout 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.610
 here she does not give a cover like that 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.470
 on the skin but it diminishes the appearance 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.180
 of people but so I have rather 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.300
 people I do not know how she would behave 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 a skin with a lot of sports but it is 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.049
 cool it gives a very uniform coverage 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.910
 she looks pretty in the face 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.920
 not the rosy wonder so I do not know why 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.470
 I do not have it anymore I still play that 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.739
 That my base is not standing there at the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.190
 Cinderella but I really like her people. 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.610
 so I indicate a cheap national base 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.230
 with a very good quality it is not 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.299
 Wonderful, so our almost incredible 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 of a wonderful culture but for the 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.209
 day to day for those who want a skin like this 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.549
 but light knows during the day for whom 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.989
 does not want a heavy skin to smell her 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.269
 it's not very cool 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.890
 I do not know if there are people who have had this program 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.900
 but I did not like much smell 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.120
 But it's only while you are 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.450
 passing when I was applying there 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.440
 so filled the bush 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.250
 The Indy Type Makeup Only Of These Shadows 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.320
 It's 3d that has these very shining shadows 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.210
 so she has that same smell but 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.560
 after you apply the bicheiro already 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.720
 I assume I'm not feeling the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.520
 smell so it's super quiet, it's not 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.740
 nothing that bothered me if I'm talking 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.600
 for you that I know there are people with 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.760
 such problems with product smell 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.790
 then this base cover I go alone 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.770
 finish make-up pass a concealer 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.570
 Make an eye come back here, right? 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.440
 a cuter face for you and me 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.720
 I'll be back 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.810
 something I always forget and today the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.560
 My reminder is about transferring the 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.610
 base so I have here these handkerchiefs 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.030
 paper is that I have already passed this 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.130
 passed today that an hour or so 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.280
 an hour and a half or so or so 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:21.740
 almost two eyes then make the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:26.740
 tank she transfers a little to 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 catch cause of light but she 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.750
 she transfers and was even talking about 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.900
 phone and that played knows a little bit 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.420
 Well, but I really like this people. 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.300
 basis is an inexpensive and little 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.800
 good quality I do not think she's bad for 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.590
 price that I paid for being 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.510
 generally does not last 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.020
 skin but it already starts to melt this from here 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.930
 not 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.180
 she stayed key for a few hours so it's 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.430
 if you liked the video that did not 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.470
 play to help me in the disclosure and not 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.210
