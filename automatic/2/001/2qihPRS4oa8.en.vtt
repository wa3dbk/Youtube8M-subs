00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.649 
using down your sights faster you get a
better<00:01:39.450> shot<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> person<00:01:41.420> basically<00:01:42.420> like

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
better shot at the person basically like

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.810 
better shot at the person basically like
a<00:01:42.780> point<00:01:43.140> maybe<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.829> advantage<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:44.610> another

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
a point maybe to advantage over another

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.469 
a point maybe to advantage over another
person<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> aim<00:01:46.470> down<00:01:46.829> sights<00:01:47.220> now

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
person with your a aim down sights now

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
person with your a aim down sights now
quick-draw<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.520> going

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
quick-draw is a very I think it's going

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.859 
quick-draw is a very I think it's going
to<00:01:50.700> become<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> most<00:01:51.240> handiest<00:01:51.689> perk

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to become one of the most handiest perk

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.230 
to become one of the most handiest perk
in<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> world<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.520> lots<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> times

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
in the world because it lots of times

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
in the world because it lots of times
I'm<00:01:54.509> counting<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.899> gun<00:01:55.110> fight<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.380> I'm

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
I'm counting on gun fight where I'm

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.100 
I'm counting on gun fight where I'm
taking<00:01:56.430> out<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.880> guy<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.780> running<00:01:57.960> out

taking out one guy and I'm running out
of<00:01:58.170> bullets<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.399> enough<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
of bullets and I don't have enough to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399 
of bullets and I don't have enough to
take<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.000> another<00:02:00.329> guy<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
take out another guy so what I do is I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
take out another guy so what I do is I
switched<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> my<00:02:01.890> pistol<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:03.270> quick-draw

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
switched to my pistol what quick-draw

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.240 
switched to my pistol what quick-draw
allows<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.710> switch<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.100> your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
allows you do is you switch to your

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
allows you do is you switch to your
pistol<00:02:05.670> faster<00:02:05.960> like<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.170> lot<00:02:07.409> faster<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pistol faster like a lot faster and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.919 
pistol faster like a lot faster and
another<00:02:08.520> thing<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.000> allows<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> do

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
another thing is that allows you to do

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.190 
another thing is that allows you to do
is<00:02:10.110> throw<00:02:10.470> stunt<00:02:10.920> grenades<00:02:11.280> arm<00:02:12.140> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
is throw stunt grenades arm so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.500 
is throw stunt grenades arm so
wrong<00:02:13.379> knives<00:02:13.650> whatever<00:02:14.250> twice<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.970> fast<00:02:15.270> as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
wrong knives whatever twice as fast as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.089 
wrong knives whatever twice as fast as
normal<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.319> come<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:16.950> handy

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
normal so this can come in really handy

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.740 
normal so this can come in really handy
if<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.459> want<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> throw<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.940> grenade<00:02:18.060> faster

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
if you want to throw that grenade faster

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.199 
if you want to throw that grenade faster
so<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.140> faster<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.550> basically<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.060> can

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
so it's faster so basically you can

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.869 
so it's faster so basically you can
become<00:02:21.540> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.470> speedy<00:02:22.769> Gonzalez<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.730> this

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
become kind of a speedy Gonzalez in this

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.640 
become kind of a speedy Gonzalez in this
and<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.480> marksman<00:02:25.019> allows<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.620> is

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
like in a specific location where it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.559 
like in a specific location where it
hovers<00:03:01.530> over<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:01.920> in<00:03:02.069> black<00:03:02.280> ops<00:03:02.519> um<00:03:02.790> it's

hovers over like in black ops um it's

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.180 
hovers over like in black ops um it's
more<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.290> MW<00:03:04.860> where<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.069> just

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
more like the one in MW where you just

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.220 
more like the one in MW where you just
flip<00:03:05.549> out<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.940> then<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.360> goes<00:03:06.540> wherever

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
flip out and then it just goes wherever

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.080 
flip out and then it just goes wherever
it<00:03:07.890> feels<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.519> makes<00:03:08.730> kind<00:03:08.849> of<00:03:08.940> like

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
it feels like it makes kind of like

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.819 
it feels like it makes kind of like
rotations<00:03:09.540> around<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> map<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.230> lasts<00:03:10.590> for

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
rotations around the map and lasts for

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.550 
rotations around the map and lasts for
about<00:03:11.150> 11<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.360> half<00:03:12.390> minutes<00:03:13.349> long<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
about 11 and a half minutes long and

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.620 
about 11 and a half minutes long and
pave<00:03:13.950> will<00:03:14.069> last<00:03:14.310> around<00:03:14.459> two<00:03:14.760> minutes<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.299> you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
pave will last around two minutes as you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.080 
pave will last around two minutes as you
see<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> tech<00:03:16.530> helicopter<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.730> believes

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
see the tech helicopter I think believes

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.819 
see the tech helicopter I think believes
