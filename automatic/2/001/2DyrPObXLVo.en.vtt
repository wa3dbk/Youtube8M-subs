I<00:03:52.370> would<00:03:53.370> recommend<00:03:53.760> buying<00:03:53.910> them<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.870> plan

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260

it's<00:03:57.510> like<00:03:57.860> $20<00:03:58.860> depends<00:03:59.520> on<00:03:59.610> what<00:03:59.730> on<00:04:00.030> who<00:04:00.360> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it's like $20 depends on what on who you

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.949 
it's like $20 depends on what on who you
buy<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.690> from<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.110> eBay<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:01.770> on<00:04:02.459> Amazon<00:04:03.269> or<00:04:03.570> you

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
can well actually that's pretty much the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.699 
can well actually that's pretty much the
only<00:04:06.180> places<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.660> know<00:04:06.720> where<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.019> buy<00:04:07.140> them

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
only places I know where to buy them

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.709

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.860 
but if you go to an airport and buy them
they<00:04:09.959> could<00:04:10.230> reach<00:04:10.650> up<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.040> $30<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.909> it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
they could reach up to $30 and it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.020 
they could reach up to $30 and it
