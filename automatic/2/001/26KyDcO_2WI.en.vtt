00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 the person if the doctor galvaci ask 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 you and you have a leak problem 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.920
 Water inside the car also did not see the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.619
 water fell on the ground our oil 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 vehicle watering the carpet that benefits 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.019
 also for the brescia that the floor have 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.840
 cars that have the number chances scored 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.789
 here and you get numbering only had to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 redial the car but the hint is that the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.440
 people are doing here, wherever 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.079
 This water sounds good from the bars 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 can be a heating system 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.420
 vehicle in radiator water 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 pass the radiator here and if it 's stuck 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.309
 or pests that have the valve is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.160
 flow control it may be leaking 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 and water ends up falling here and you go 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 the level of the radiator fluid 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.660
 It is leaking you test and does not find the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.629
 leakage actually the water is falling 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.550
 inside the spine vehicle either 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.650
 eyes do not even notice when she 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 realized it's already rotten 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 so it can be the radiator 17 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.689
 to isolate the hot air is the other is to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.540
 sweat beyond the air continues condensation of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.020
 Water and air conditioning tray 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 of this natural connection is her 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.920
 can be broken undocked someone 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 already took the Spanish one day did not ride 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.990
 this right banner your tray can 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.729
 being is pouring water that condenses 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.070
 also this water falls on the carpet 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.100
 wet dog is fair and also 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.670
 the floor of your vehicle 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.200
 So it's a messy loss, there you go. 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.880
 It's going to eliminate the hot air to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.229
 schedule to do the repair later 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.990
 for the final draw the panel for example 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 c4 is not the hottest thing in the world. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.030
 world and it's a bit of a dude of course you 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.610
 will make the country the the system reminds 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.790
 not lock the flow if you lock the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.070
 water flow 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.080
 I remember having to return bypass ie 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.440
 a fee to enter there does not close the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.090
 The circulation of water is 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.840
 water is if when defeated promoter 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.880
 so always gathering so much here and 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.640
 to finish you will change the additive of the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.040
 car reminiscent of opening the air valve 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840
 hot of the day comes in control here opens 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.380
 So that circulated in the water for you too. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.180
 changing the water is probably already 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.880
 additive inside the radiator inside 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.459
 of the panel if in the history of the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.130
 valve hangs because you have changed owner 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.200
 of the car but did not change the liquid vitali 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.930
 itabom medical of the car and of course this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.800
 country doubt that he has helped and I 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.200
 I see here on the site to adopt the br 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.900
