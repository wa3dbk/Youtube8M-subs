00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.870 

I<00:01:23.990> was<00:01:24.530> born<00:01:24.770> during<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> war<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.610> after<00:01:25.730> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
I was born during the war and after the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.120 
I was born during the war and after the
war<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.540> Manila<00:01:26.840> was<00:01:27.140> destroyed<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.950> mean

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
war and Manila was destroyed you mean

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.260 
war and Manila was destroyed you mean
90%<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.170> everything<00:01:31.010> grew<00:01:31.370> up<00:01:31.550> again<00:01:31.970> as<00:01:32.240> a

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
90% and so everything grew up again as a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.790 
90% and so everything grew up again as a
vegetation<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.640> as<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.480> was<00:01:35.660> growing<00:01:35.840> up<00:01:36.170> there

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
vegetation and as I was growing up there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.920 
vegetation and as I was growing up there
I<00:01:36.830> enjoyed<00:01:37.490> with<00:01:37.730> my<00:01:37.880> brothers<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.510> I<00:01:38.720> just

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
I enjoyed with my brothers and I just

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.420 
I enjoyed with my brothers and I just
exploring<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.950> nature<00:01:41.830> but<00:01:42.830> when<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.010> went<00:01:43.340> to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
exploring the nature but when I went to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.400 
exploring the nature but when I went to
America<00:01:44.120> I<00:01:44.330> was<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:44.780> New<00:01:44.870> York

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
America I was in New York

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.430 
America I was in New York
everything<00:01:45.920> was<00:01:46.130> machines<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.810> started<00:01:48.290> to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
everything was machines so I started to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.950 
everything was machines so I started to
look<00:01:49.040> at<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.400> relationship<00:01:50.000> with<00:01:50.150> man<00:01:50.420> nature

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
look at the relationship with man nature

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.670 
look at the relationship with man nature
and<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> Machine<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:53.000> was<00:01:53.180> actually

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
and the Machine and that was actually

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
and the Machine and that was actually
some<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:54.800> my<00:01:54.920> early<00:01:55.250> studies

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.219 

this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> very<00:02:05.700> early<00:02:06.119> work<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.600> mine<00:02:06.869> it's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this is a very early work of mine it's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.249 
this is a very early work of mine it's
called<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.619> bubble<00:02:07.979> machine<00:02:08.360> plug<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.660> use<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
called a bubble machine plug can use and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
called a bubble machine plug can use and
this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.890> reference<00:02:11.310> structure<00:02:11.910> much<00:02:12.120> later

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
this is a reference structure much later

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.759 
this is a reference structure much later
on

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.729 

the<00:02:15.769> inspiration<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.940> very<00:02:17.360> much<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.560> own

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
the inspiration was very much all my own

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.550 
the inspiration was very much all my own
experiences<00:02:19.580> during<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.090> war<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.690> saw<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
experiences during the war I saw as a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.720 
experiences during the war I saw as a
toddler

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
toddler

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.900

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
young man shot and he was dying

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.479 
young man shot and he was dying
and<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:26.780> saw<00:02:27.019> bubbles<00:02:27.500> coming<00:02:27.920> out<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.280> his

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
and they saw bubbles coming out of his

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.240 
and they saw bubbles coming out of his
mouth<00:02:29.739> girls<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.430> see<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:33.250> then

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
mouth girls that you can see and then

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.479 
mouth girls that you can see and then
much<00:02:34.519> later<00:02:34.989> my<00:02:35.989> mother<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:37.040> cooking

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
coconut so I also saw bubbles then when

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.630 
coconut so I also saw bubbles then when
I<00:02:44.120> first<00:02:44.390> went<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.720> America<00:02:45.379> I<00:02:45.650> saw<00:02:46.160> from<00:02:46.459> above

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
I first went to America I saw from above

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.539 
I first went to America I saw from above
the<00:02:47.120> air<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.630> saw<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.170> cloud<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:49.010> me<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.430> we

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
the air I saw this cloud see me so we

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.390 
the air I saw this cloud see me so we
were<00:02:49.670> flying<00:02:49.940> over<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.900> Pacific<00:02:50.959> Ocean<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
were flying over the Pacific Ocean the

Grand Canyon and over New York

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.759 
Grand Canyon and over New York
and<00:02:55.120> finally<00:02:56.120> my<00:02:56.390> final<00:02:56.810> inspiration<00:02:57.170> was

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769

we went down from the castle to line our
backs<00:03:10.910> our<00:03:11.269> King<00:03:11.450> Arthur<00:03:11.810> seat<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.379> as<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.680> was

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
backs our King Arthur seat and as I was

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.880 
backs our King Arthur seat and as I was
watching<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.370> clouds<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:14.060> got<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> idea<00:03:15.319> for

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.069 
watching the clouds I got the idea for
this<00:03:16.099> kind<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.459> work<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.299> migration<00:03:17.900> is

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
this kind of work the migration is

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.129 
this kind of work the migration is
because<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:19.430> was<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:20.269> experiences<00:03:20.900> came

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
because this was the experiences came

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.870
