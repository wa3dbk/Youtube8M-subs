00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 is a major health problem the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 diabetic retinopathy because that also 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.770
 it is a disease that caught at 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.510
 beginning in the first stages then 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 in a very high percentage of cases it has 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.110
 very good solution but if you take the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.599
 final that when it's when it starts to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 be symptomatic in those stages the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.930
 expensive treatments are difficult 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.180
 and there are many times are not enough 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 to prevent blindness does not have to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.890
 expect no symptoms the diabetic there 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.080
 some established guidelines that consist 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 in which a juvenile diabetic a child 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.880
 When diabetes is diagnosed it is very 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 very rare that you have retinopathy the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 childhood diabetes is a group is a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.730
 part of diabetes that has some 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 Special features children are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.910
 very symptomatic among types have 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.590
 commas and are generally diagnosed 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.879
 soon then there is no time for 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.379
 the disease has affected the eyes 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 then a child is considered 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 diagnosed diabetes does not need to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.379
 immediately check your eyes but 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.030
 if after 5 or 10 years of being 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 diabetic is convenient that once a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 year go to Malaga that's diabetes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 Children diabetes type 1 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.940
 adult's diabetes when he gives his face and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.890
 when an adult person 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.900
 he learns that he is diabetic can be 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.520
 diabetic long ago and that's why a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 adult diabetic when diagnosed 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.940
 he has to have ophthalmological control 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.799
 at the time of diagnosis of your 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.119
 diabetes and then once a year and 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.560
 then based on the findings that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.940
 have if you are a diabetic who is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.799
 perfectly well controlled and its 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.360
 General disease has no affectation 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.119
 ocular to the best you can see it every 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.409
 two years but an adult diabetic in the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.880
 when your diabetes is diagnosed 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 has to be revised has to 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 check yourself when it is very important to me 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 when I speak I have in the consultation a 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.880
 diabetic who saw it for the first time what 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.649
 first we ask him about his 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 general illness how it is controlled 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.860
 and how many times does your doctor go to see who is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.860
 a doctor how does he wear it because of this 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.330
 control depends not only on the stadium of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.399
 eye disease in which it comes to me 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 but how will you respond to 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.909
 ophthalmological treatments done if a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.530
 patient does not control his diabetes 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 Although we have the best 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.300
 current techniques those of surgery all 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.300
 we can not keep the vision
