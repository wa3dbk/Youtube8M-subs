if<00:00:04.850> you<00:00:05.390> needed<00:00:05.569> to<00:00:05.720> construct<00:00:06.319> the<00:00:06.590> trussing

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
if you needed to construct the trussing

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.090 
if you needed to construct the trussing
say<00:00:08.180> you<00:00:08.750> know<00:00:08.870> some<00:00:09.080> scaffolding<00:00:09.680> or<00:00:09.950> any

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
say you know some scaffolding or any

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.400 
say you know some scaffolding or any
kind<00:00:10.309> of<00:00:10.370> framework<00:00:10.639> of<00:00:11.000> geometry<00:00:11.570> I<00:00:11.780> could

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
kind of framework of geometry I could

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.990 
kind of framework of geometry I could
take<00:00:12.619> a<00:00:12.650> little<00:00:12.830> bit<00:00:13.010> of<00:00:13.129> time<00:00:13.309> building<00:00:13.699> all

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
take a little bit of time building all

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.180 
take a little bit of time building all
the<00:00:14.180> different<00:00:14.539> you<00:00:15.199> know<00:00:15.320> pipes<00:00:15.650> and<00:00:16.010> and

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
the different you know pipes and and

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.000 
the different you know pipes and and
pieces<00:00:17.119> here<00:00:17.449> but<00:00:18.140> there's<00:00:18.289> actually<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.650> fast

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
pieces here but there's actually a fast

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.980 
pieces here but there's actually a fast
way<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.310> doing<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:19.910> with<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.300> particle<00:00:20.810> line

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
way of doing it with the particle line

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.950 
way of doing it with the particle line
thickness<00:00:21.500> options<00:00:22.460> in<00:00:22.640> layout<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:23.720> what

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
thickness options in layout so what

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.600 
thickness options in layout so what
we'll<00:00:24.080> do<00:00:24.200> is<00:00:24.350> we'll<00:00:24.470> close<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:24.860> down<00:00:25.040> and

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
we'll do is we'll close this down and

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.670 
we'll do is we'll close this down and
I've<00:00:25.700> got<00:00:25.850> just<00:00:26.060> three<00:00:26.510> basic<00:00:26.930> objects<00:00:27.560> here

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
I've got just three basic objects here

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.130 
I've got just three basic objects here
I've<00:00:27.770> got<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:27.920> box<00:00:28.190> a<00:00:28.820> ball<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.780> then<00:00:29.870> I've<00:00:29.990> got

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
I've got a box a ball and then I've got

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.409 
I've got a box a ball and then I've got
this<00:00:30.260> two-point<00:00:30.860> poly<00:00:31.130> chain<00:00:31.490> that's<00:00:32.149> just

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
this two-point poly chain that's just

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.260 
this two-point poly chain that's just
kind<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.629> a<00:00:32.780> random<00:00:33.440> little<00:00:34.090> squiggle<00:00:35.090> here

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
kind of a random little squiggle here

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.510 
kind of a random little squiggle here
just<00:00:35.539> so<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.780> can<00:00:35.930> we<00:00:36.289> can<00:00:36.320> take<00:00:36.560> a<00:00:36.620> look<00:00:36.829> it<00:00:37.100> if

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
just so we can we can take a look it if

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.940 
just so we can we can take a look it if
we<00:00:37.730> wanted<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.090> we<00:00:38.210> could<00:00:38.239> rail<00:00:38.780> extrude<00:00:39.350> to

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
we wanted to we could rail extrude to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.410 
we wanted to we could rail extrude to
give<00:00:40.100> thickness<00:00:40.579> but<00:00:40.760> we're<00:00:40.910> over<00:00:41.030> in<00:00:41.239> layout

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
give thickness but we're over in layout

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.990 
give thickness but we're over in layout
and<00:00:41.870> we're<00:00:42.290> gonna<00:00:42.380> do<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:42.620> with<00:00:43.190> rendering<00:00:43.700> so

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
and we're gonna do it with rendering so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.760 
and we're gonna do it with rendering so
what<00:00:44.750> we<00:00:44.840> can<00:00:44.989> do<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.320> I'm<00:00:45.440> going<00:00:45.560> to<00:00:45.620> hop<00:00:45.739> over

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
what we can do is I'm going to hop over

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.639 
what we can do is I'm going to hop over
to<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.160> surface<00:00:46.670> editor<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.290> we're<00:00:48.290> gonna<00:00:48.380> go

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
to the surface editor and we're gonna go

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.510 
to the surface editor and we're gonna go
to<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.940> surface<00:00:50.360> that<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:50.950> used<00:00:51.950> for<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.220> ball

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
to the surface that I used for the ball

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.840 
to the surface that I used for the ball
in<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.880> box<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.450> under<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:53.989> Advanced<00:00:54.559> tab<00:00:54.850> if

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
in the box and under the Advanced tab if

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.780 
in the box and under the Advanced tab if
we<00:00:56.059> check<00:00:56.360> render<00:00:56.870> outlines<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.800> instead<00:00:58.700> of

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
we check render outlines and instead of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.250 
we check render outlines and instead of
giving<00:00:58.969> it<00:00:59.120> a<00:00:59.180> positive<00:00:59.480> number

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
giving it a positive number

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.750 
giving it a positive number
let's<00:01:00.680> give<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:01.010> negative<00:01:01.250> number<00:01:01.579> I'm

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's give it a negative number I'm

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.020 
let's give it a negative number I'm
gonna<00:01:01.880> put<00:01:02.030> negative<00:01:02.210> ten<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.850> let's<00:01:04.850> do<00:01:05.000> a

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
gonna put negative ten and let's do a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.440 
gonna put negative ten and let's do a
render<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:07.040> now<00:01:07.250> instead<00:01:07.939> of<00:01:08.090> rendering<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
render so now instead of rendering the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.590 
render so now instead of rendering the
polygons<00:01:09.020> anywhere<00:01:09.740> it's<00:01:09.920> got<00:01:10.100> an<00:01:10.249> edge

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
polygons anywhere it's got an edge

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.059 
polygons anywhere it's got an edge
anywhere<00:01:11.600> between<00:01:11.749> the<00:01:11.929> two<00:01:12.109> points<00:01:12.319> we're

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
anywhere between the two points we're

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.219 
anywhere between the two points we're
gonna<00:01:13.159> get<00:01:13.459> this<00:01:13.789> trussing<00:01:14.569> and<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.020> the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
gonna get this trussing and and the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.139 
gonna get this trussing and and the
thicker<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:16.249> want<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:16.789> just<00:01:16.969> need<00:01:17.119> a

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
thicker we want it we just need a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.359 
thicker we want it we just need a
negative<00:01:18.139> number<00:01:18.469> so<00:01:18.770> I'm<00:01:18.859> actually<00:01:19.039> going<00:01:19.280> to

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
negative number so I'm actually going to

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.249 
negative number so I'm actually going to
open<00:01:19.399> up<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.819> surface<00:01:19.999> editor<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.810> let's

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
open up the surface editor and let's

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.230 
open up the surface editor and let's
just<00:01:21.409> go<00:01:21.619> we'll<00:01:22.009> do<00:01:22.159> both<00:01:22.700> ways<00:01:22.939> we're<00:01:23.149> gonna

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
just go we'll do both ways we're gonna

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.809 
just go we'll do both ways we're gonna
go<00:01:23.420> negative<00:01:23.889> 15<00:01:24.889> so<00:01:24.920> we'll<00:01:25.310> go<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.429> little

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
go negative 15 so we'll go a little

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.739 
go negative 15 so we'll go a little
thicker<00:01:26.179> so<00:01:26.509> I'm<00:01:27.289> doing<00:01:27.529> f9<00:01:28.119> okay<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.179> if<00:01:29.539> I<00:01:29.630> go

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
thicker so I'm doing f9 okay so if I go

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.330 
thicker so I'm doing f9 okay so if I go
page<00:01:30.020> up<00:01:30.229> page<00:01:30.380> down<00:01:30.439> we<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.069> see<00:01:31.219> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
page up page down we can see the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.120 
page up page down we can see the
difference<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.779> the<00:01:33.409> lower<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:33.979> number

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
difference so the the lower the number

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.639 
difference so the the lower the number
so<00:01:34.609> if<00:01:35.359> I<00:01:35.569> go<00:01:35.689> negative<00:01:35.899> 20<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.380> gonna<00:01:36.469> get

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
so if I go negative 20 it's gonna get

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.940 
so if I go negative 20 it's gonna get
thicker<00:01:36.709> if<00:01:37.279> I<00:01:37.459> go<00:01:37.670> let's<00:01:38.659> do<00:01:38.810> negative<00:01:39.020> five

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
thicker if I go let's do negative five

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.889 
thicker if I go let's do negative five
so<00:01:40.429> we'll<00:01:40.549> go<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.700> little<00:01:40.969> thinner<00:01:42.219> and<00:01:43.899> we'll

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
so we'll go a little thinner and we'll

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.499 
so we'll go a little thinner and we'll
see<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.200> we've<00:01:46.009> got<00:01:46.189> thinner<00:01:46.969> lines<00:01:47.240> there

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
see that we've got thinner lines there

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.109 
see that we've got thinner lines there
now<00:01:47.689> I've<00:01:48.499> got<00:01:48.709> a<00:01:48.740> different<00:01:49.159> surface<00:01:49.609> for<00:01:49.939> the

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
now I've got a different surface for the

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.789 
now I've got a different surface for the
two-point<00:01:50.389> poly<00:01:50.659> chain<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:51.079> we<00:01:51.349> were<00:01:51.499> to<00:01:51.619> go

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
two-point poly chain if we were to go

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.599 
two-point poly chain if we were to go
over<00:01:52.069> and<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:53.270> negative<00:01:53.599> ten<00:01:54.279> we're<00:01:55.279> not<00:01:55.429> gonna

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
over and do negative ten we're not gonna

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.940 
over and do negative ten we're not gonna
get<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.969> same<00:01:56.179> result<00:01:56.630> okay<00:01:57.380> because<00:01:57.679> two

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
get the same result okay because two

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.319 
get the same result okay because two
point<00:01:58.189> Polly's<00:01:58.549> work<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.849> little<00:01:59.060> different

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
point Polly's work a little different

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.659 
point Polly's work a little different
they're<00:01:59.450> more<00:01:59.630> like<00:01:59.779> edges<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:01.520> there's

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:01.669 
they're more like edges because there's

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:04.300 
they're more like edges because there's
no<00:02:01.880> three<00:02:02.749> point<00:02:02.959> or<00:02:03.079> four<00:02:03.229> point<00:02:03.439> or<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:04.069> guns

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
no three point or four point or in guns

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.760 
no three point or four point or in guns
here<00:02:04.759> we've<00:02:05.329> got<00:02:05.569> to<00:02:05.689> work<00:02:05.810> with<00:02:05.840> with<00:02:06.409> edges

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
here we've got to work with with edges

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.589 
here we've got to work with with edges
so<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.489> doesn't<00:02:07.729> really<00:02:07.789> matter<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:08.239> this<00:02:08.390> is

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
so it doesn't really matter if this is

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.729 
so it doesn't really matter if this is
on<00:02:08.750> or<00:02:08.899> not<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.170> I'm<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.319> going<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.560> set<00:02:09.709> it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
on or not but I'm just going to set it

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.620 
on or not but I'm just going to set it
back<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.069> default<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.700> what<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.239> need<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> do

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
back to default and what we need to do

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.330 
back to default and what we need to do
for<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> two<00:02:12.170> point<00:02:12.410> Polly's<00:02:12.830> is<00:02:13.010> we'll<00:02:13.220> head

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
for the two point Polly's is we'll head

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.420 
for the two point Polly's is we'll head
over<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.610> object<00:02:14.300> properties<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.440> under<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
over to object properties and under the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.680 
over to object properties and under the
edges<00:02:16.910> tab

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
edges tab

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.740 
edges tab
will<00:02:18.530> change<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.400> particle<00:02:19.910> line<00:02:20.120> thickness

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
will change the particle line thickness

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.530 
will change the particle line thickness
I'm<00:02:21.410> going<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:21.680> ahead<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.220> change<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
I'm going to go ahead and change that to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.330 
I'm going to go ahead and change that to
well<00:02:23.960> negative<00:02:24.140> ten<00:02:24.500> seemed<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.950> work<00:02:25.070> pretty

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
well negative ten seemed to work pretty

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.910 
well negative ten seemed to work pretty
good<00:02:25.460> for<00:02:26.090> actually<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.350> know<00:02:27.440> what<00:02:27.560> negative

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
good for actually you know what negative

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
good for actually you know what negative
five<00:02:28.130> seems<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.030> look<00:02:29.120> better<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
five seems to look better in the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.260 
five seems to look better in the
negative<00:02:30.620> ten<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.220> looks<00:02:31.700> better<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> ball

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
negative ten it looks better on the ball

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.680 
negative ten it looks better on the ball
in<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.510> box<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:32.990> let's<00:02:33.020> try<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.690> there

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
in the box so let's try that and there

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.230 
in the box so let's try that and there
we<00:02:35.810> go<00:02:35.930> now<00:02:35.960> we've<00:02:36.380> got<00:02:36.940> sickness<00:02:37.940> we've<00:02:38.120> got

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
we go now we've got sickness we've got

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.180 
we go now we've got sickness we've got
actual<00:02:38.600> like<00:02:38.780> piping<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.560> tubing<00:02:40.040> on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
actual like piping it's like tubing on

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.310 
actual like piping it's like tubing on
here<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:41.180> as<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.570> can<00:02:41.690> see<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.960> renders

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
here and as you can see it renders

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.500 
here and as you can see it renders
fairly<00:02:43.130> quick<00:02:43.340> now<00:02:43.550> one<00:02:43.970> thing<00:02:44.090> that's<00:02:44.150> really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
fairly quick now one thing that's really

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.630 
fairly quick now one thing that's really
nice<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.010> an<00:02:46.130> actual<00:02:46.280> surface

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
nice is that this is an actual surface

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.670 
nice is that this is an actual surface
that<00:02:46.970> we<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.090> work<00:02:47.360> with<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:48.440> go<00:02:48.650> over

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that we can work with so if we go over

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.030 
that we can work with so if we go over
to<00:02:49.190> our<00:02:49.610> surface<00:02:50.060> editor<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.870> I'm<00:02:51.710> just<00:02:51.860> gonna

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
to our surface editor and I'm just gonna

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.250 
to our surface editor and I'm just gonna
move<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.580> little<00:02:52.790> faster<00:02:53.360> by<00:02:53.510> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.900> windows

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
move a little faster by going to windows

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.470 
move a little faster by going to windows
presets<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.630> let's<00:02:56.630> choose<00:02:58.210> let's<00:02:59.210> choose<00:02:59.450> a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
presets and let's choose let's choose a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360 
presets and let's choose let's choose a
surface<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.350> mean<00:03:00.800> I'll<00:03:00.920> just<00:03:00.950> go<00:03:01.130> ahead<00:03:01.190> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
surface I mean I'll just go ahead and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.700 
surface I mean I'll just go ahead and
choose<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.820> mirror<00:03:02.240> surface<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.350> take<00:03:03.680> a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
choose the mirror surface and take a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.940 
choose the mirror surface and take a
look<00:03:03.920> at<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.160> okay<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:06.620> I've<00:03:06.740> got<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
look at that okay so now I've got the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.150 
look at that okay so now I've got the
mirror<00:03:07.190> surface<00:03:07.610> on<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:09.380> two-point<00:03:09.740> poly<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
mirror surface on the two-point poly and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.300 
mirror surface on the two-point poly and
if<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.460> if<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.910> want<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.330> can<00:03:11.390> head<00:03:11.660> over<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
if I if I want I can head over to the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.890 
if I if I want I can head over to the
other<00:03:13.310> surface<00:03:13.580> for<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.910> boxing<00:03:14.300> ball<00:03:14.510> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
other surface for the boxing ball and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.720 
other surface for the boxing ball and
we'll<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.500> go<00:03:15.710> over<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> different<00:03:16.310> metal

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
we'll just go over to a different metal

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.840 
we'll just go over to a different metal
surface<00:03:17.380> metal<00:03:18.380> seems<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.860> be<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> fun<00:03:19.580> one<00:03:19.700> to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
surface metal seems to be a fun one to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.330 
surface metal seems to be a fun one to
work<00:03:19.970> with<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.420> we'll<00:03:21.140> do<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.010> rippled

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
work with and we'll do the the rippled

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.060 
work with and we'll do the the rippled
chrome<00:03:22.900> okay<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:25.810> because<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.080> copied<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
chrome okay and because I copied the the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.730 
chrome okay and because I copied the the
preset<00:03:28.520> setting<00:03:28.910> over<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.840> also<00:03:30.170> changed<00:03:30.560> in

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
preset setting over it also changed in

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.050 
preset setting over it also changed in
the<00:03:30.860> Advanced<00:03:31.160> tab<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.550> I'm<00:03:31.610> gonna<00:03:31.700> go<00:03:31.880> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the Advanced tab so I'm gonna go and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.320 
the Advanced tab so I'm gonna go and
just<00:03:32.240> change<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.440> render<00:03:33.709> outlines<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.640> for

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
just change the render outlines and for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.020 
just change the render outlines and for
the<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:35.930> we'd<00:03:36.050> like<00:03:36.080> negative<00:03:36.830> five<00:03:37.520> I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
the I think we'd like negative five I

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.740 
the I think we'd like negative five I
think<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.420> one<00:03:38.540> looked<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.930> best<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:40.750> there

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
think that one looked the best and there

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.160 
think that one looked the best and there
we<00:03:41.870> go

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
we go

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.040 
we go

check<00:03:48.020> render<00:03:48.590> outline<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.280> make<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.459> active

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
check render outline so make that active

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.300 
check render outline so make that active
and<00:03:50.150> put<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> negative<00:03:50.840> value<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.739> line<00:03:52.010> size

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
can get your trussing or your framework

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.960 
can get your trussing or your framework
quite<00:04:05.209> easy<00:04:05.480> without<00:04:05.900> having<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.760> build<00:04:07.760> it

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.060 
editor I've went ahead and set up on all
the<00:04:17.390> different<00:04:17.660> surfaces<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:18.169> negative<00:04:18.830> five

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
the different surfaces a negative five

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.370 
the different surfaces a negative five
and<00:04:19.459> we'll<00:04:19.580> do<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.730> render<00:04:20.150> of<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:20.780> you

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
and we'll do a render of that and you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.470 
and we'll do a render of that and you
can<00:04:21.500> see<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.890> it's<00:04:22.010> making<00:04:22.220> up<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.760> framework

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
can see that it's making up a framework

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.710 
can see that it's making up a framework
of<00:04:23.810> them<00:04:23.960> I'm<00:04:24.110> gonna<00:04:24.230> shift<00:04:24.740> C<00:04:24.980> T<00:04:25.400> for<00:04:25.720> remove

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
of them I'm gonna shift C T for remove

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.460 
of them I'm gonna shift C T for remove
and<00:04:27.310> just<00:04:28.310> get<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> close<00:04:28.789> up

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and just get a close up

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.930 
and just get a close up
and<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:31.100> can<00:04:31.250> see<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:32.180> set<00:04:32.720> up<00:04:32.840> here<00:04:33.460> using<00:04:34.460> you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
and we can see a set up here using you

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.810 
and we can see a set up here using you
know<00:04:35.060> an<00:04:35.180> organic<00:04:35.630> character<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.820> replacing

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
know an organic character and replacing

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.360 
know an organic character and replacing
the<00:04:38.120> surface<00:04:38.510> with<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.140> trussing<00:04:39.680> with

the surface with the trussing with
render<00:04:40.970> outlines<00:04:41.330> here's<00:04:41.930> one<00:04:42.200> last<00:04:42.350> example

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
render outlines here's one last example

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.550 
render outlines here's one last example
showing<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.730> same<00:04:44.450> object<00:04:44.990> right<00:04:45.200> on<00:04:45.320> top<00:04:45.530> of

itself and one version of the object has

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.190 
itself and one version of the object has
the<00:04:49.610> render<00:04:50.000> outlines<00:04:50.390> which<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.840> giving<00:04:51.110> us

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
the render outlines which is giving us

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.930 
the render outlines which is giving us
all<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.470> trussing<00:04:51.980> all<00:04:52.100> this<00:04:52.190> framework<00:04:52.700> and

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
all this trussing all this framework and

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.540 
all this trussing all this framework and
the<00:04:53.870> other<00:04:54.050> object<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.620> just<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:55.070> regular

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the other object is just a regular

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.460 
the other object is just a regular
object<00:04:55.700> with<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.120> this<00:04:56.660> blue<00:04:56.930> reflective

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
object with a this blue reflective

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.440 
object with a this blue reflective
surface<00:04:57.830> on<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.130> I'm<00:04:58.520> gonna<00:04:58.610> go<00:04:58.760> ahead<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.030> and

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
surface on it I'm gonna go ahead and and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.470 
surface on it I'm gonna go ahead and and
go<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.320> another<00:05:00.590> render<00:05:00.950> show<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.430> close-up<00:05:01.760> so

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
go to another render show a close-up so

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.630 
go to another render show a close-up so
as<00:05:02.540> you<00:05:02.660> can<00:05:02.780> see<00:05:03.020> because<00:05:03.650> there's<00:05:04.040> thickness

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
as you can see because there's thickness

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.200 
as you can see because there's thickness
to<00:05:05.180> each<00:05:05.840> one<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.110> these<00:05:06.320> lines<00:05:06.670> it's<00:05:07.670> it's

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
to each one of these lines it's it's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.000 
to each one of these lines it's it's
able<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.570> even<00:05:09.110> though<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.410> geometry<00:05:09.920> is

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
able to even though the geometry is

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.290 
able to even though the geometry is
right<00:05:10.220> on<00:05:10.340> top<00:05:10.520> of<00:05:10.550> each<00:05:10.700> other<00:05:10.850> that's

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
right on top of each other that's

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.380 
right on top of each other that's
showing<00:05:11.750> through<00:05:12.080> which<00:05:12.680> allows<00:05:12.980> us<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.460> come

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
showing through which allows us to come

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.940 
showing through which allows us to come
up<00:05:14.480> with<00:05:14.630> some<00:05:14.750> really<00:05:14.960> fun<00:05:15.290> stuff<00:05:15.620> where<00:05:15.830> you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
up with some really fun stuff where you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.920 
up with some really fun stuff where you
can't<00:05:16.220> see<00:05:16.550> through<00:05:16.970> to<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.480> other<00:05:17.630> side

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
can't see through to the other side

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.360 
can't see through to the other side
where<00:05:18.230> you<00:05:18.380> might<00:05:18.530> have<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.680> lot<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.920> trussing

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
where you might have a lot of trussing

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.700 
where you might have a lot of trussing
that<00:05:19.490> might<00:05:19.610> be<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:19.760> little<00:05:20.060> harder<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.330> read<00:05:20.710> so

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
that might be a little harder to read so

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.350 
that might be a little harder to read so
this<00:05:21.980> is<00:05:22.100> just<00:05:22.220> another<00:05:22.490> example<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:23.180> using

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
this is just another example of using

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.669 
this is just another example of using
render<00:05:23.840> outlines<00:05:24.260> on<00:05:24.669> geometry
