 favorite of all broadway musicals 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.190

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 gay 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.970
 be defensive 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.920

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.190

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 to be able to talk because I do not want to talk about 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.469

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.520
 if it were the other way around 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.369
