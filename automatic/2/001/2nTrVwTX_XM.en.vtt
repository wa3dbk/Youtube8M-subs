voltmeters that I'm going to be

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.900 
voltmeters that I'm going to be
fiberglassing<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
fiberglassing into here they're going to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
fiberglassing into here they're going to
be<00:00:45.059> flush<00:00:45.329> you're<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.100> lifted

up like that so I'm going to cut this

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.529 
up like that so I'm going to cut this
pocket<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:50.120> calculate<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> glass<00:00:51.390> them

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
pocket out and calculate the glass them

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
pocket out and calculate the glass them
in<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:54.170> one<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> two<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.250> yeah<00:00:59.399> let's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in there one and two and so yeah let's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.260 
in there one and two and so yeah let's
see<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.270> goes<00:01:01.699> all<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

see how that goes all right here you can
see<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.750> doing<00:01:04.309> with<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> basically

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
see what I'm doing with this basically

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
see what I'm doing with this basically
it<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.659> looks<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.170> solid<00:01:07.439> piece

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it all this looks like one solid piece

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.120 
it all this looks like one solid piece
now<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> real<00:01:09.409> bunch<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.530> thick<00:01:10.830> spots

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
now I got a real bunch of thick spots

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
now I got a real bunch of thick spots
put<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> primer<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.020> gonna<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> over<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
put the primer so I'm gonna go over and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
put the primer so I'm gonna go over and
stand<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.820> refill<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
stand that all down and then refill it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
stand that all down and then refill it
again<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.369> probably<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> couple<00:01:17.729> layers

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

couple<00:01:18.750> coats<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.229> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> fill<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
couple coats just kind of fill in

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
couple coats just kind of fill in
because<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.210> scratches<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.330 
stuff so I'll go over with a fine grit
and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.100> reprime<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.829> it<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:28.920> looks<00:01:29.159> like

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and then reprime it it all looks like

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then reprime it it all looks like
one<00:01:29.520> piece<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.900> goal<00:01:33.920> alright<00:01:34.920> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

was<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> ended<00:02:21.060> up<00:02:21.150> cutting<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.690> up

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
was in there I ended up cutting this up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.390 
was in there I ended up cutting this up
and<00:02:23.750> basically<00:02:24.750> filling<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.440> all<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.980> big

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
and basically filling in all the big

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.860 
and basically filling in all the big
spaces<00:02:28.070> turned<00:02:29.070> out<00:02:29.190> kind<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.400> nice<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.720> now

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
spaces turned out kind of nice so now

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.020 
spaces turned out kind of nice so now
there's<00:02:31.170> actually<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.250> know<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> spot<00:02:32.760> here

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
there's actually you know a spot here

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.120 
there's actually you know a spot here
that's<00:02:33.210> thin<00:02:33.630> enough<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.770> wanted<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's thin enough so if I wanted to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's thin enough so if I wanted to
like<00:02:35.630> drill<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> hole<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.530> put<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> switch<00:02:38.100> in

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
like drill a hole and put a switch in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.370 
like drill a hole and put a switch in
there<00:02:38.550> or<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:39.390> something<00:02:39.630> else<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.320> I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
there or put something else in there I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.770 
there or put something else in there I
could<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.850> basically<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.510> went

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
could do that so I basically just went

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.960 
could do that so I basically just went
over<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.290> epoxy<00:02:44.510> epoxied<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:46.970> pieces

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
over this with epoxy epoxied the pieces

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.949 
over this with epoxy epoxied the pieces
in<00:02:48.180> every<00:02:49.110> piece<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.770> then<00:02:49.890> epoxied<00:02:50.640> down

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
in every piece and then epoxied down

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.350 
in every piece and then epoxied down
this<00:02:51.959> whole<00:02:52.260> trim<00:02:52.560> ring<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:54.060> i'll<00:02:54.120> let

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this whole trim ring and so i'll let

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.260 
this whole trim ring and so i'll let
this<00:02:54.480> stuff<00:02:54.720> set<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.970> then<00:02:56.970> i'll<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.209> able

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
this stuff set up and then i'll be able

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.180 
this stuff set up and then i'll be able
to<00:02:57.420> fiberglass<00:02:57.720> over<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.560> whole<00:02:58.709> thing<00:02:58.740> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
to fiberglass over the whole thing and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.620 
to fiberglass over the whole thing and
paint<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.030> should<00:03:00.390> be<00:03:00.480> good<00:03:02.209> yeah<00:03:03.209> there's<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
paint it should be good yeah there's a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.970 
paint it should be good yeah there's a
progress<00:03:04.140> video<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.560> guess<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.650> kind<00:03:07.920> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
progress video I guess so that kind of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.759 
progress video I guess so that kind of
looks<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:09.230> chrome<00:03:10.230> bezel<00:03:10.590> molded<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.070> two

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
looks like chrome bezel molded in two

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.100 
looks like chrome bezel molded in two
volt<00:03:13.769> meter's<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.820> for<00:03:15.030> 16<00:03:15.420> 12<00:03:15.720> volts

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
volt meter's going to be for 16 12 volts

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:26.750 
volt meter's going to be for 16 12 volts
and<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.800> looking<00:03:20.010> like<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:26.010> shifter

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
and just looking like and the shifter

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.810 
and just looking like and the shifter
section<00:03:27.269> kind<00:03:28.110> of<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.350> fill<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.680> with<00:03:28.830> body

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
section kind of just fill that with body

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.509 
section kind of just fill that with body
filler<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.269> molded<00:03:30.720> all<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.519> that's

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
filler and molded all that so that's

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.830 
filler and molded all that so that's
what<00:03:32.760> that's<00:03:32.970> looking<00:03:33.330> like<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:38.540> got<00:03:39.540> some

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
what that's looking like and I got some

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.259 
what that's looking like and I got some
more<00:03:40.019> glass<00:03:40.470> laid<00:03:40.800> here<00:03:41.160> some<00:03:41.640> bop<00:03:41.850> body

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
more glass laid here some bop body

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.340 
more glass laid here some bop body
filler<00:03:44.180> looks<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.300> little<00:03:45.420> gobby<00:03:45.720> right<00:03:46.170> now

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
filler looks a little gobby right now

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.370 
filler looks a little gobby right now
but<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.800> always<00:03:46.950> looks<00:03:47.220> better<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.700> end

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
but it always looks better in the end

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.630 
but it always looks better in the end
and<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.470> think<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.070> actually<00:03:50.250> going<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
and I think this is actually going to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.090 
and I think this is actually going to
turn<00:03:50.820> out<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.060> smooth<00:03:51.860> that's<00:03:52.860> how<00:03:52.950> it's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
turn out pretty smooth that's how it's

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.890 
turn out pretty smooth that's how it's
looking<00:03:53.400> right<00:03:53.820> now<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.600> already<00:03:54.810> looks

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
looking right now it already looks

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.050 
looking right now it already looks
pretty<00:03:55.560> decent<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:56.070> think

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.680 

and<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.210> other<00:04:00.360> side<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:06.000> i'll<00:04:06.330> just<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.660> to

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
and the other side so i'll just have to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.860 
and the other side so i'll just have to
smooth<00:04:07.050> that<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.410> up<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:09.590> should<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.680> good
