00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
in every piece of gear i think it should

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
in every piece of gear i think it should
be<00:00:50.730> lightweight<00:00:51.090> needs<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.050> high<00:00:52.199> quality

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
be lightweight needs to be high quality

and it should be low cost other thing is
I<00:00:54.690> feel<00:00:54.960> gear<00:00:55.530> needs<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.039> elegant<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.670> think

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
I feel gear needs to be elegant I think

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
I feel gear needs to be elegant I think
it<00:00:57.180> should<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.539> exactly<00:00:58.050> what<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.500> designed

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it should do exactly what it's designed

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
it should do exactly what it's designed
to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> simplest<00:00:59.940> most<00:01:00.270> consistent

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
