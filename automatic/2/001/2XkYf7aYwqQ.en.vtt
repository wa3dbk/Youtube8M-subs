00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it's going to get compressed but if you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.860 
it's going to get compressed but if you
were<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:30.140> connect<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:32.870> to

also<00:00:41.460> depends<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:45.450> your

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
also depends on what your what your

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.139 
also depends on what your what your
recording<00:00:46.020> too<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.500> nothing<00:00:47.309> incredibly

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
recording too so nothing incredibly

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.939 
recording too so nothing incredibly
interesting<00:00:48.660> video<00:00:49.760> but<00:00:51.350> at<00:00:52.350> least<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
interesting video but at least you get a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.020 
interesting video but at least you get a
good<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.699> decent<00:00:54.120> idea<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.739> cam<00:00:56.520> forms

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
good or decent idea on how the cam forms

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
good or decent idea on how the cam forms
in<00:00:57.210> daylight<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.050> let's<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.350> walk<00:00:58.500> over<00:00:58.620> here

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
in daylight so let's just walk over here

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
in daylight so let's just walk over here
we're<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.399> Baltimore<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:01.760> we're<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.910> fells

we're in Baltimore and we're in fells
point<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.870> see<00:01:04.019> actually<00:01:04.350> straight

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
point you can see actually straight

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.060 
point you can see actually straight
ahead<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.240> Under<00:01:07.140> Armour<00:01:08.570> headquarters

ahead is the Under Armour headquarters
and<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.390> walk<00:01:12.780> over<00:01:13.049> there

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and let's see if we can walk over there

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810 
and let's see if we can walk over there
nitra<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.189> then<00:01:14.340> we'll<00:01:14.490> walk<00:01:14.610> over

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
nitra see it and then we'll walk over

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.200 
nitra see it and then we'll walk over
here<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.439> flower<00:01:16.439> pot<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.210> take

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
here to this little flower pot and take

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.030 
here to this little flower pot and take
a<00:01:18.240> quick<00:01:18.630> macro<00:01:19.290> video

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
a quick macro video

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.580 
a quick macro video
of<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.670> flowers<00:01:22.090> now<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.780> does<00:01:23.050> there<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.560> a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
of the flowers now it does there is a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.910 
of the flowers now it does there is a
image<00:01:24.430> stabilization<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:25.570> device<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
image stabilization on this device and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.770 
image stabilization on this device and
let's<00:01:27.130> hope<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.640> guy<00:01:27.850> doesn't<00:01:28.060> not<00:01:28.540> be

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
let's hope that this guy doesn't not be

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.850 
let's hope that this guy doesn't not be
over<00:01:30.630> where's<00:01:31.630> image<00:01:31.990> stabilization<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.740> this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
over where's image stabilization on this

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.480 
over where's image stabilization on this
device<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.340> there's<00:01:33.580> also<00:01:33.820> i'm<00:01:34.360> walking<00:01:34.720> over

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
device and there's also i'm walking over

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090 
device and there's also i'm walking over
cobblestones<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:38.080> image<00:01:38.350> stabilization

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
cobblestones the image stabilization

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.420 
cobblestones the image stabilization
we've<00:01:39.490> been<00:01:39.640> getting<00:01:40.330> put<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.930> test<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
we've been getting put to the test and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.500 
we've been getting put to the test and
there's<00:01:42.760> also<00:01:42.940> auto<00:01:43.770> refocusing<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:46.090> can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
there's also auto refocusing so it can

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.860 
there's also auto refocusing so it can
refocus<00:01:48.510> while<00:01:49.510> it's<00:01:49.750> being<00:01:49.870> recorded<00:01:50.790> but

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
refocus while it's being recorded but

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
refocus while it's being recorded but
let's<00:01:52.870> go<00:01:53.050> over<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.500> check<00:01:53.560> out<00:01:53.950> these

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
let's go over and check out these

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490 
let's go over and check out these
flowers<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.130> we<00:01:57.250> can<00:01:57.490> see<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.110> does<00:01:59.229> with

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
flowers so we can see how it does with

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.310 
flowers so we can see how it does with
macro<00:01:59.920> footage<00:02:03.180> cool<00:02:04.180> boat

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
macro footage cool boat

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.979 
macro footage cool boat
pretty<00:02:07.320> nice<00:02:07.530> day<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.890> general<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.989> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
pretty nice day in general actually in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170 
pretty nice day in general actually in
Baltimore<00:02:10.709> aside<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> fact<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Baltimore aside from the fact that the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.570 
Baltimore aside from the fact that the
Orioles<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:13.160> didn't<00:02:14.160> make<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.310> playoffs

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
Orioles just didn't make the playoffs

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.229 
Orioles just didn't make the playoffs
and<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> Ravens<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.050> lost<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> bills

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
and the Ravens just lost to the bills

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.170 
and the Ravens just lost to the bills
but<00:02:18.239> here<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.019> go<00:02:20.209> some<00:02:21.209> flowers<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:23.180> see

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
but here you go some flowers and see

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.009 
but here you go some flowers and see
there<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.690> tap<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.410> screen<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:27.629> change

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there we can tap on the screen to change

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.490 
there we can tap on the screen to change
the<00:02:28.769> focus<00:02:29.629> so<00:02:30.629> that's<00:02:30.840> why<00:02:30.989> we're<00:02:31.230> recording

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the focus so that's why we're recording

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.039 
the focus so that's why we're recording
which<00:02:31.799> is<00:02:31.920> pretty<00:02:32.069> neat<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.840> actually

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
which is pretty neat and this actually

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.660 
which is pretty neat and this actually
looks<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.410> good

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.730 

so<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> looks<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.810> auto<00:02:42.959> refocusing<00:02:43.650> is

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
so it looks like the auto refocusing is

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.460 
so it looks like the auto refocusing is
pretty<00:02:43.950> nice<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.400> those<00:02:45.090> images<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.870> I'm<00:02:46.200> if

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
pretty nice and those images if I'm if

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
pretty nice and those images if I'm if
they<00:02:46.530> looked<00:02:46.739> as<00:02:47.040> good<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.459> screen<00:02:47.760> as

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
they looked as good on the screen as

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.570 
they looked as good on the screen as
they<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.800> as<00:02:49.800> they<00:02:50.069> do<00:02:50.130> through<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
they do as they do through the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.740 
they do as they do through the
viewfinder<00:02:50.849> then<00:02:51.330> that's<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.690> be

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
viewfinder then that's going to be

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
viewfinder then that's going to be
really<00:02:52.020> good<00:02:52.560> quality<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.540> see

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
really good quality and you can see

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
really good quality and you can see
we're<00:02:54.930> blurry<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:55.860> tap<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> screen

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
we're blurry so we just tap the screen

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.670 
we're blurry so we just tap the screen
again<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.910> will<00:02:57.000> refocus<00:02:57.620> on<00:02:58.620> what's

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
again and it will refocus on what's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.080 
again and it will refocus on what's
ahead<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.670> us<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.470> pretty<00:03:01.470> neat

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.380 

and<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:08.530> think<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.970> may<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.180> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and I think that's it this may be the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.690 
and I think that's it this may be the
longest<00:03:10.780> sample<00:03:11.230> video<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.769> have<00:03:11.950> fur<00:03:12.160> done<00:03:12.459> or
