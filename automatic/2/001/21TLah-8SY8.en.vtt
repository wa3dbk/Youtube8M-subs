00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 hello everyone I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.080
 talk about the zombies on the bourget map 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.150
 As you can see we are in the cinema mode with the 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.640
 free and good camera you will see how bad 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.910
 what is done in what is the cinema mode 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.119
 no or with the free camera we can see 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.380
 thousand and one failures is worth or thousand and one details 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.329
 It's worth here for the map on which 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.800
 we just bring the camera a little 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.470
 to a rock and we can see the outside of the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.239
 map you are not going to see a few of these 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.309
 ok they are simply small details 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.130
 but then a little later you go to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.079
 see how to get out with the camera free of 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.300
 map without creating any trick or that is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.890
 say you do not need to do any trick to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.179
 see you know that if we do a trick and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.660
 we are with the player out of the map 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.249
 you put third person and then you put 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.019
 free camera you are already with the camera 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.519
 free off the map what but assume that 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.870
 do not do any trick because we like them 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.030
 the tricks or whatever but yes that 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.519
 fancy the best to do some 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.780
 kinematics something like that do not count the part 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.790
 from above the tower that the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.680
 towers that far away and that's good if 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.900
 you want to do that now you are going to see a 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.340
 strategic point where we can take the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.080
 free camera without the need to do 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.880
 no trick is worth simply take out the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 good camera that you are seeing some 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.010
 of the points it is worth that I said that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.800
 you just go 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.180
 to what is the rock there is not as you see by 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.830
 you can see the outside of the map this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.660
 it would not have to be this way it's really worth 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.040
 all rocks should be solid 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.560
 so it did not look good on the outside 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 because this is like taking a step back 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 this reminds me of the play 1 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 back then I went on this kind of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.360
 things also not with the free camera 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.100
 because at that time there was no 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.750
 cinema mode and no game but yes that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.310
 while you played yes they sometimes looked 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 strange things as well as outside of 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.910
 map did not happen to me in those 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 times the report speed is worth and sometimes 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.200
 the floor was gone and everything became 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.540
 transparent things that happened before that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 in theory today should not happen 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.600
 that is, this would not have to happen 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.750
 ok we are with the free camera 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 it's just cinema mode, it's not 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.990
 I would have to see worth something is worth not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.310
 influences the game does not have to do 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 but it should not be there worth so 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.350
 except I think good and I said it 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.680
 again you know that I recently made a 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.180
 video of the mansion not where it looked there 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 a window that looked outside the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.680
 management map had left that already 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.120
 they have repaired vale is the window that already 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.950
 you have gotten things now you are going to see 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.930
 a little later they have laid the 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.000
 objects and that so it does not look so ugly 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.230
 right here this before was not 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 ok no one knew the outside 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.320
 of the map but as you can see neither 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.030
 perfection of all because it follows 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.640
 looking at the outside of the map for another one 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.830
 according to which sites do not like you are seeing 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.970
 there now you are going to see also here by hand 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.890
 left 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.320
 You are also going to see what is outside 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.790
 the church and all that and good and after 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.030
 of these and now I'm going to teach how 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.709
 take out the free camera by the map voucher 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.330
 and be able to do cinematics as you want 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.430
 be freely outside the map and 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.709
 even power post in even if only 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.090
 to explore a bit because not everyone 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.250
 only as I want it is worth 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.810
 mainly he did it more than anything 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.340
 Well, for cinematics, especially 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.650
 out in this part of here from the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.330
 mansion just where is the part 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.190
 on the right is what you have to 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.770
 do is just put there when 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.120
 you put against what the rock and a 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.070
 little what is the booth that there is 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.300
 it 's like it's broken and you start a 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.190
 little as well as to move where you see 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.480
 transparent and have it up 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.250
 everything up is already out 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.830
 of the map with the free camera is worth 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.480
 move where you want is worth so 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.850
 both piercing eyes rocks as 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
 going up here as you will see 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.610
 more than anything to do some 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.830
 cinematic as I say it's pretty 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.920
 well this I already did it in 10 wright 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.720
 he also did a pussycat in transit and 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.700
 well I really could not get the camera 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.130
 so without doing tricks it is worth the only 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.140
 way you can take out the camera was 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.330
 doing tricks or with the plane but 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.370
 good as you have seen I have not done 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 No trick in this game simply 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.360
 I've put on the cinema mode I've set 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.880
 look with chairs and in the end finish 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.620
 coming out not this kind of kinematics is 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.690
 the one that I said not here because I miss it 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.040
 so a little fast but if curra 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.150
 Jce can look pretty pretty in some 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.550
 video some editing can be 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.100
 pretty good especially that in the part 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.210
 from above not then what in the part of 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.890
 down here not here as you are 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.660
 watching simply put the camera a 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.070
 little there when you see a little 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.810
 transparent you start to push for 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.400
 top to top or left to right 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.470
 and up and in the end they end up coming out 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.970
 and you can be all over the east of the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.130
 map you can see things that are not usually 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.290
 see and it was just this it is worth it already I 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.850
 They asked for the first days when I started 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.650
 to do it worth they asked me for a bit of 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.280
 gas that will teach how to do it then good 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.500
 here it is 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.240
 so when it was simply this I hope 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.860
 that has helped you that I have 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.260
 liked and if you liked to give me 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.340
 like favorites and see you 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.340
 greetings to all 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.350
 now 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.610
 and 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.950
 if I go 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.879
 do not
