00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
in there as well now how I achieved this

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.070 
in there as well now how I achieved this
look<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.440> x<00:02:31.800> over<00:02:32.160> plucking<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.210> over<00:02:33.570> waxing

too far across sort of in between

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030 
too far across sort of in between
because<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.600> common<00:02:40.170> misconception<00:02:40.350> with<00:02:40.980> I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
because a common misconception with I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
because a common misconception with I
rather<00:02:41.310> than<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.520> guess<00:02:41.760> someone<00:02:42.030> drilled<00:02:42.450> this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
rather than I guess someone drilled this

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.720 
rather than I guess someone drilled this
into<00:02:42.900> me<00:02:43.020> when<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.650> kid<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.220> starting<00:02:44.700> to

into me when I was a kid and starting to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.660 
into me when I was a kid and starting to
wax<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.120> eyebrows<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> thought<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
wax my eyebrows and thought I was so

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.240 
wax my eyebrows and thought I was so
cool<00:02:49.130> from<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:51.209> side<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.810> nose<00:02:51.959> past<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
cool from the side of your nose past the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.479 
cool from the side of your nose past the
inner<00:02:53.520> corner<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> your<00:02:54.030> eyes<00:02:54.239> straight<00:02:54.720> up

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and you can see that if that were the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.220 
and you can see that if that were the
case<00:02:59.030> my<00:03:00.030> eyebrows<00:03:00.420> would<00:03:00.600> be<00:03:00.780> pretty<00:03:01.140> much

thought<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.150> as<00:05:33.330> well<00:05:33.690> is<00:05:34.050> that<00:05:34.080> if<00:05:34.319> you're

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
thought of as well is that if you're

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:36.619 
thought of as well is that if you're
going<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.740> try<00:05:35.009> and<00:05:35.099> do<00:05:35.400> this<00:05:35.460> if<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.060> sort<00:05:36.539> of

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
going to try and do this if you sort of

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.570 
going to try and do this if you sort of
plucked<00:05:36.930> your<00:05:37.110> eyebrows<00:05:37.500> or<00:05:37.740> waxing<00:05:38.190> too<00:05:38.340> far

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
plucked your eyebrows or waxing too far

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.469 
plucked your eyebrows or waxing too far
apart<00:05:38.669> like<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.270> had<00:05:40.190> maybe<00:05:41.190> just<00:05:41.729> gradually

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
apart like I had maybe just gradually

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.760 
apart like I had maybe just gradually
bring<00:05:42.810> them<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.080> with<00:05:43.169> the<00:05:43.229> pencil<00:05:43.500> because

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
bring them in with the pencil because

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.649 
bring them in with the pencil because
like<00:05:44.039> i<00:05:44.190> said<00:05:44.219> i've<00:05:44.490> been<00:05:44.669> feeling<00:05:45.360> them<00:05:45.569> in

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
like i said i've been feeling them in

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.240 
like i said i've been feeling them in
for<00:05:45.810> about<00:05:45.990> two<00:05:46.169> years<00:05:46.379> so<00:05:46.650> now<00:05:46.800> i<00:05:46.830> think<00:05:46.949> i

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
for about two years so now i think i

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.249 
for about two years so now i think i
look<00:05:47.400> ridiculous<00:05:47.729> with<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:48.449> app<00:05:48.659> and<00:05:48.690> drawn

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
look ridiculous with the app and drawn

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.730 
look ridiculous with the app and drawn
in<00:05:49.440> but<00:05:49.620> if<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.810> like<00:05:51.810> take<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.289> all<00:05:52.409> the<00:05:52.440> way

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
in but if you like take it all the way

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.119 
in but if you like take it all the way
into<00:05:53.039> it<00:05:53.250> should<00:05:53.490> be<00:05:53.669> on<00:05:53.729> you<00:05:54.020> like<00:05:55.020> if<00:05:55.919> that's

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
into it should be on you like if that's

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.149 
into it should be on you like if that's
a<00:05:56.250> very<00:05:56.490> dramatic<00:05:56.669> change<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.509> will<00:05:58.159> you'll

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
a very dramatic change it will you'll

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.249 
a very dramatic change it will you'll
think<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.610> doesn't<00:05:59.909> look<00:06:00.150> right<00:06:00.419> but<00:06:00.930> if<00:06:01.080> you

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
think it doesn't look right but if you

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.159
