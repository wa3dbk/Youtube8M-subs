00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
spaces and vice versa or to destroy all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.270 
spaces and vice versa or to destroy all
the<00:00:48.930> enemies<00:00:49.260> units<00:00:50.030> okay<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.530> in<00:00:52.530> each<00:00:52.680> each

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the enemies units okay so in each each

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.779 
the enemies units okay so in each each
phase<00:00:53.550> turn<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.340> imperial<00:00:56.340> player<00:00:56.550> goes

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
phase turn the the imperial player goes

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
phase turn the the imperial player goes
first<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.449> actions<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.320> can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
first and you get two actions you can

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.620 
first and you get two actions you can
either<00:01:03.260> do<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> move<00:01:04.619> action<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.970> attack

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
either do a move action or do a attack

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.520 
either do a move action or do a attack
action<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:10.700> just

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.130 

so<00:01:15.530> for<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.070> move<00:01:16.250> action<00:01:16.430> will<00:01:16.880> use<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
so for the move action will use the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.850 
so for the move action will use the
attack<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:20.079> you<00:01:21.079> can<00:01:21.619> move<00:01:22.869> one<00:01:23.869> slice<00:01:24.170> into

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
attack and you can move one slice into

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.800 
attack and you can move one slice into
an<00:01:25.189> empty<00:01:25.460> connected<00:01:26.000> space<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:28.060> say<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.420> come

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
an empty connected space so say I come

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.649 
an empty connected space so say I come
here<00:01:30.259> I<00:01:30.939> come<00:01:31.939> in<00:01:32.149> with<00:01:32.270> here

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
here I come in with here

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.029 
here I come in with here
that's<00:01:33.619> one<00:01:33.799> space<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:35.810> get<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.860> I

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
that's one space so I get that and I

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:46.840 
that's one space so I get that and I
move<00:01:37.250> him<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:45.009> okay<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.549> same

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
move him like that okay and the same

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.270 
move him like that okay and the same
movement<00:01:47.299> goes<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:48.640> all<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.700> other<00:01:49.850> units

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
movement goes for all the other units

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.380 
movement goes for all the other units
basically<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.530> two<00:01:55.390> movement

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
basically you can do two movement

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.669 
basically you can do two movement
actions<00:01:57.110> in<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.409> turn<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:59.470> cannot<00:02:00.470> move

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
actions in a turn but you cannot move

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.690 
actions in a turn but you cannot move
the<00:02:00.740> same<00:02:01.240> unit<00:02:02.240> twice<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.750> time<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.459> could

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the same unit twice in a time so I could

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
the same unit twice in a time so I could
move<00:02:04.850> him<00:02:05.209> and<00:02:06.009> say<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:08.090> guy<00:02:08.330> here<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:10.610> better

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.100 

but<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.250> could<00:02:15.489> not<00:02:15.640> move<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.950> guy<00:02:18.189> twice<00:02:19.110> or

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
but I could not move this guy twice or

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.600 
but I could not move this guy twice or
the<00:02:20.950> attack<00:02:21.280> twice<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:22.329> one<00:02:22.390> turn<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:24.430> can

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the attack twice in one turn you can

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.679 
the attack twice in one turn you can
also<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.370> into<00:02:27.579> a<00:02:27.610> milkman<00:02:27.939> action<00:02:28.269> or<00:02:28.510> an

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
also do you into a milkman action or an

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.949 
also do you into a milkman action or an
attack<00:02:28.959> action<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.670> we'll<00:02:31.659> just<00:02:33.750> move<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
attack action and we'll just move the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.380 
attack action and we'll just move the
units<00:02:35.230> around<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.980> bit<00:02:36.159> so<00:02:37.090> we've<00:02:37.269> got<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:39.390> good

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
units around a bit so we've got a good

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:52.770 
units around a bit so we've got a good
way<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.319> attack<00:02:44.730> grab<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.290> okay<00:02:50.609> so<00:02:51.659> what<00:02:52.659> we

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
way to attack grab that okay so what we

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.149 
way to attack grab that okay so what we
do<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.819> just<00:02:54.819> putting<00:02:55.090> back<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:56.739> we<00:02:56.829> do<00:02:56.950> to

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
do to just putting back what we do to

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:06.319 
do to just putting back what we do to
attack<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:03.629> again<00:03:04.629> I'll<00:03:04.780> use<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.139> high<00:03:05.409> that

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
attack is again I'll use the high that

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.319 
attack is again I'll use the high that
we<00:03:07.329> look<00:03:07.510> at<00:03:07.599> people<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.340> shows<00:03:09.639> that<00:03:10.090> the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
we look at people and it shows that the

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:16.080 
we look at people and it shows that the
attacks<00:03:10.920> attack<00:03:11.920> range<00:03:13.379> is<00:03:14.379> four<00:03:14.859> cups<00:03:15.760> are

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
attacks attack range is four cups are

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.940 
attacks attack range is four cups are
three<00:03:16.389> spaces<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.379> that's<00:03:18.060> one

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
three spaces so that's one

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.180 
three spaces so that's one
in<00:03:20.280> space<00:03:20.550> 2<00:03:21.210> space<00:03:21.240> 3<00:03:21.840> spaces<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.710> can<00:03:22.980> go

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
in space 2 space 3 spaces you can go

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.170 
in space 2 space 3 spaces you can go
over<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> gaps

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
over the gaps

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.670 
over the gaps
you<00:03:24.810> can't<00:03:25.170> fire<00:03:25.470> 3<00:03:25.800> people<00:03:27.590> with<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
you can't fire 3 people with the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.960 
you can't fire 3 people with the
movement<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.130> can't<00:03:29.340> go<00:03:29.490> over<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.790> gaps

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
movement you can't go over the gaps

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.100 
movement you can't go over the gaps
obviously<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.740> see<00:03:34.890> his<00:03:35.540> range<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
obviously and we can see his range is

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.640 
obviously and we can see his range is
much<00:03:37.860> smaller<00:03:38.600> it's<00:03:39.600> only<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:40.050> space

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.250 

okay<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.760> we're<00:03:46.209> looking<00:03:46.420> at<00:03:46.510> gotta<00:03:46.690> get

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
okay so the we're looking at gotta get

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.589 
okay so the we're looking at gotta get
out<00:03:47.440> can<00:03:47.739> shoot<00:03:48.040> him<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:52.090> what<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.330> would<00:03:52.420> do

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
out can shoot him so what you would do

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:00.470 
out can shoot him so what you would do
would<00:03:52.870> be<00:03:52.900> get<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:54.069> dice<00:03:56.760> dice<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:58.390> roll<00:03:58.420> it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
would be get the dice dice you roll it

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.830 
would be get the dice dice you roll it
we've<00:04:01.480> got<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.840> white<00:04:03.000> now<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.510> look<00:04:04.659> in<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
we've got a white now you look in the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.089 
we've got a white now you look in the
book<00:04:04.959> again<00:04:06.629> look<00:04:07.629> right<00:04:08.019> and<00:04:08.319> why<00:04:08.769> do<00:04:08.829> some

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
book again look right and why do some

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:17.279 
book again look right and why do some
miss<00:04:09.340> we<00:04:09.849> miss<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.480> target<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.959> would<00:04:17.139> be

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
miss we miss the target so that would be

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.909 
miss we miss the target so that would be
his<00:04:17.859> attack<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:19.090> he<00:04:19.600> messed<00:04:19.840> up<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.260> there

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
his attack and he messed up so there

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.640 
his attack and he messed up so there
would<00:04:21.010> be<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.130> waste<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.519> attack<00:04:22.080> um<00:04:23.080> let's<00:04:23.500> say

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
would be a waste of attack um let's say

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.670 
would be a waste of attack um let's say
the<00:04:23.830> dice<00:04:24.039> have<00:04:25.289> brought<00:04:26.289> something

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
the dice have brought something

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.469 
the dice have brought something
different<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:29.680> is<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.160> forced<00:04:30.699> hit<00:04:33.389> and<00:04:34.389> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
different that is a forced hit and the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.689 
different that is a forced hit and the
force<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:34.990> same<00:04:35.260> as<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.470> hit<00:04:35.740> which<00:04:36.580> I'll

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
force is is same as a hit which I'll

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.430 
force is is same as a hit which I'll
explain<00:04:36.820> in<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:37.240> second<00:04:37.510> should<00:04:37.930> definitely

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
explain in a second should definitely

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.659 
explain in a second should definitely
other<00:04:38.500> way<00:04:38.650> run<00:04:39.060> but<00:04:40.060> if<00:04:40.150> you've<00:04:40.330> got<00:04:44.669> Darth

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
other way run but if you've got Darth

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.779 
other way run but if you've got Darth
Vader<00:04:45.970> or<00:04:47.160> Luke<00:04:48.160> Skywalker<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.080> attacking

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
Vader or Luke Skywalker in the attacking

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:57.540 
Vader or Luke Skywalker in the attacking
force

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.600 

you<00:04:58.270> can<00:04:58.509> destroy<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.410> whole<00:04:59.440> genome<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.460> that

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
you can destroy the whole genome so that

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.339 
you can destroy the whole genome so that
means<00:05:03.789> you<00:05:03.879> take<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.150> whole<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.780> whole<00:05:04.960> unit

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
means you take the whole the whole unit

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:12.469 
means you take the whole the whole unit
and<00:05:05.759> chuck<00:05:06.759> it<00:05:06.909> in<00:05:07.000> there<00:05:07.150> back<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.020> box

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.730 

because<00:05:13.479> he<00:05:13.690> doesn't<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.050> force<00:05:14.409> it<00:05:14.590> would

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
because he doesn't have force it would

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.390 
because he doesn't have force it would
just<00:05:14.919> be<00:05:15.009> classed<00:05:15.220> as<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> hit<00:05:15.699> which<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:17.400> red

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
just be classed as a hit which is red

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.559 
just be classed as a hit which is red
and<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:20.169> hit<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.430> must<00:05:21.639> remove<00:05:21.909> one<00:05:22.210> figure

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
and a hit is you must remove one figure

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:33.180 
and a hit is you must remove one figure
from<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.990> target<00:05:23.349> unit<00:05:30.330> okay<00:05:31.330> so<00:05:31.919> do<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.039> same

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
from the target unit okay so do the same

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.159 
from the target unit okay so do the same
thing<00:05:33.430> except<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.300> remove<00:05:34.690> one

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
thing except you remove one

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.040 
thing except you remove one
now<00:05:35.979> if<00:05:36.159> they'd<00:05:36.340> rolled<00:05:36.639> instead<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.599> head

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
now if they'd rolled instead of the head

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.820 
now if they'd rolled instead of the head
if<00:05:38.650> they'd<00:05:38.919> roll<00:05:39.159> the<00:05:39.490> force<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:41.380> wouldn't

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
if they'd roll the force you wouldn't

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.540 
if they'd roll the force you wouldn't
just<00:05:42.009> remove<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:44.069> you<00:05:45.069> would<00:05:46.830> remove<00:05:47.830> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
just remove on you would remove the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.300 
just remove on you would remove the
whole<00:05:48.759> unit

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.969 

if<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.909> the<00:05:55.240> force<00:05:55.509> thing<00:05:56.139> is<00:05:56.319> an<00:05:56.500> interesting

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
if the the force thing is an interesting

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.589 
if the the force thing is an interesting
idea<00:05:57.280> we've<00:05:58.150> done<00:05:58.650> if<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.889> was<00:06:00.099> that<00:06:00.280> last<00:06:00.639> say

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
idea we've done if it was that last say

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.980 
idea we've done if it was that last say
these<00:06:01.810> two<00:06:02.050> have<00:06:02.139> been<00:06:02.409> killed<00:06:03.219> you<00:06:03.969> you<00:06:04.690> leave

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
these two have been killed you you leave

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.899 
these two have been killed you you leave
the<00:06:06.300> vehicle<00:06:07.300> down<00:06:07.949> and<00:06:08.949> then<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.370> next<00:06:09.789> time

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
the vehicle down and then the next time

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.589 
the vehicle down and then the next time
it<00:06:10.090> takes<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.419> hit<00:06:10.979> then<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.099> remove<00:06:12.400> it<00:06:12.599> so

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
it takes a hit then you remove it so

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.779 
it takes a hit then you remove it so
it's<00:06:13.779> go<00:06:13.960> like<00:06:14.169> this<00:06:14.620> isn't<00:06:14.860> all<00:06:15.099> cats<00:06:15.490> as<00:06:15.669> an

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
it's go like this isn't all cats as an

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:22.980 
it's go like this isn't all cats as an
extra<00:06:16.060> unit<00:06:18.300> or<00:06:19.300> an<00:06:19.360> extra<00:06:19.630> piece<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.529> Health

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.110 

all<00:06:23.990> right<00:06:24.110> that's<00:06:24.290> all<00:06:24.350> so<00:06:24.500> that's<00:06:25.430> the<00:06:25.700> basic

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
all right that's all so that's the basic

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.050 
all right that's all so that's the basic
rules<00:06:27.760> don't<00:06:28.760> think<00:06:28.910> I've<00:06:28.970> forgotten

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
rules don't think I've forgotten

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.730 
rules don't think I've forgotten
anything<00:06:29.450> there

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
anything there

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.490 
anything there
there's<00:06:31.160> also<00:06:33.040> advanced<00:06:34.040> rules
