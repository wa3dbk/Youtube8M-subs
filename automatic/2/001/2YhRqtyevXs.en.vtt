00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.910
 with even author gas-powered vehicles are enjoying growing popularity 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.770
 However, many drivers are still unsure how a felt 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.880
 Under pressure there are gas tanks in case of serious accidents or vehicle fires 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.100
 In relation to this, the ADAC undertook various tests and safety 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.480
 to investigate LPG systems 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.109
 Since April 2006, only tested systems may be retrofitted 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.750
 first a rear impact with 60 km / h and one for such collision accidents 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.750
 typical coverage of 70 percent 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 Where else the spare wheel has its place, the gas tank is bolted 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.750
 The yellow stripes should later possibly occurring deformations 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.280
 demonstrate 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.400
 no explosion 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.810
 provoked the guest had emptied and filled the gas tank with water 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.050
 the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.010
 4 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 hol 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.199
 a camera filmed LÃ¶rrach received 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.480
 Gassers made 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.660
 the subsequent check shows that the holder and Hans Zellner and 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.660
 a line connections remained intact 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 Although the tank is minimally damaged, but the welds are intact 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.510
 Now follows a test of the gas system for leaks 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.890
 Frank made a crash filled with gas 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 but at parents with a gauge checked for gas leakage and then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 determined that the entire gas system is still tight 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.700
 the tank is sent new entry 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.150
 he has expensive though 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.280
 with a lot of energy 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.280
 directed by the structure of the heats 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.440
 that means that he is there the rear of the vehicle 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.399
 taxed 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.360
 Winsen from Eleven to find great information 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.780
 In addition to the guest, he also has a bit of radio on this vehicle 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.470
 there is water in the gas of that is not leaked that is called 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 Fuel tank is just as dense and want as the district council 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.080
 A safety valve in operation ensured that the gas can flow again 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.300
 when the engine is running 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.420
 but even after starting the engine 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 There were no leaks here 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.809
 But what happens if the vehicle in an accident in Brands device 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.809
 that too should be clarified in another test 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.519
 This and Multivan Team II ensures safe pressure conditions in the tank 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.409
 Metal flags with gasoline under the marks simulate spilled fuel like 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.859
 it is often the case in practice 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.139
 it gets serious 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.459
 vehicle fire 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.459
 an infrared camera shows the feet represented 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 Here's just the first row 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:52.100
 when in Tonga a certain transmission has been achieved 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.870
 here is the safety valve gradually gas from Germany 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.870
 controlled burned 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.099
 the rural youth experience in the areas mark the biggest heat 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.559
 that's up to that 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.109
 one of the Titanic guests an explosion is therefore probably not sure 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.109
 prevented 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.519
 the safety valve distance but addressed 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.229
 Gates escaped controlled 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.559
 it did not explode 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.879
 therefore it can be assumed that this fort since the war just as certain that 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.799
 In comparison, my VinziPort stuff would have been the one performed 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.759
 usually plastic tanks melt through the heat 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.359
 the b-team is running out 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.179
 spreads out on the street and burns up there too 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:37.329
 The experiments have shown me the place, according to Ethos Vehicles 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.949
 Comparable are preliminary and will be checked if at the place of residence
