00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.250
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.750
 new video I am simo and today seen 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.970
 that we are in the field of updates on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.460
 clash of place I'll bring you another news 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.870
 this time on minecraft in fact on twitter 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.120
 the manufacturers have released these 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.980
 images unfortunately have put only 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.450
 the initial but these was an image that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.920
 I found from an American youtuber not 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.719
 I hide it from you 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.820
 here are things that are likely to add 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.450
 in the minecraft pocket edition game 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 updating 0:12 zero point enne 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 which stands for nether or the possibility 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.420
 to go through the portal 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.480
 in hell with all their respective 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.780
 mob for example the gas hopefully also the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.670
 blazy with her skeleton and more then 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.550
 will put the chance to sprint 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.840
 ie to run and the smic it should 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.760
 being the shift is therefore that of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.329
 crouch to avoid falling gods 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.540
 blocks will then want to put the cats 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.850
 that is to say, cats are those that do 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.369
 they train to find big leopards 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.740
 given in the jungle giving them some fish and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.389
 they will make the clippers escape and then 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.509
 will probably also put the 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:19.819
 crouching koman com mans ie in 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.649
 practice and the keys for example those that 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.939
 begin with slash as game mode 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.959
 times set 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.759
 the player types then there are the or if 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.520
 they will find it unlikely to be introduced 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.709
 in fact they are the ones in the game 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.319
 that if fish data become attached 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.509
 we will become cats then promise 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.060
 they will probably also make langhe 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.240
 red to hunger and therefore will serve more 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.130
 food to feed just to avoid 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.889
 starving will want to put then 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.929
 maybe even the horses you need 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:54.979
 to move to avoid even of 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.020
 consume food indeed when we 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.470
 we will climb the minecraft horses in a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.540
 we will consume fans 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.550
 and this will be very useful for those who do not 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 wants to waste too much food and then 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.060
 will probably also put the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.040
 hard core mode ie that mode 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.800
 in which we will have only one life and if 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.810
 we die we must erase the world 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.240
 they will put the golems back to the iron 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.170
 golem and google is therefore we can do the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.150
 snow farm then they will put 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 the gases though they have already been 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 implemented minecraft photo which says a 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.810
 0.11 in fact it is enough to put a certain 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 code in a few thing wounded a bow that 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.070
 I'll probably review some of them 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.750
 day on my channel will issue 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.940
 probably the guardians do this to us 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.040
 think that if I probably say 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 they will probably put the guardians 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580
 it will mean that they will put the effects 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.709
 potions to move more 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
 quickly and for the appearance that there 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.750
 they will struggle to dig and then 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.910
 even the submarine times may come 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.310
 very well in the new update 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.250
 then they also put the enchanting 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.500
 finally and I say finally we can of 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 new charm our stuff for 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.840
 example the sword with routing that one 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.940
 to be able to steal or to do more 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.500
 give or pick to collect 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.600
 directly to the stone or the glass if 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.600
 then we must probably break it 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.070
 we will also put land and also 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.080
 this will make us think immediately 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.330
 while to the bosch factor of the lander 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.489
 dragon and it will be very useful so at least 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.320
 we could also see a little more than 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.230
 functionality in this game that is 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.360
 quite boring in my opinion why 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.540
 we are only in love her works we can 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.959
 call closed in 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.430
 in English this makes us a bit boring 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.930
 after a while because you build everything 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.790
 take small of file diamonds 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.250
 Armor Diamond then there is no more 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.659
 sense of going ahead and then putting it 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.909
 also how many experiences if we 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.030
 we must enchant things we will need to 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:49.870
 consequence or cause the experience then 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.299
 in fact the cast for the portions 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.980
 0 against 11.0 pocket editions had been 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.959
 implemented only the effects of 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.939
 potions and therefore will mean that there 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.739
 they will do the drives with the still 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.409
 we could distill them we could drink 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.299
 or launch then will be issued by 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.430
 ciments which is for example when 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.099
 let's break the wood tell us this 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.540
 player has collected wood or 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.659
 when we find the diamond will tell us 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.790
 diamonds the anvils and therefore we can 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.519
 move the spells or repair the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.160
 objects had to fashions that is the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.780
 adventure mode from in my opinion not 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.789
 I know then there were some changes on tour a 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.110
 that mode in practice where not 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.910
 we can break the blocks there 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.229
 need the specific tools for 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.330
 example of cannot break the earth 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.180
 I don't need the ball with my hands then 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.099
 they will put the flower pot or the jars 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.780
 flowers from this where there was a 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.430
 very graphic detail marine vacations 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860
 in how many we can finally hold 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.510
 of plants at home and then check the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.130
 support that I think could be 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.330
 that way in which we for example 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.300
 we still like eder and with a 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.729
 remote control a keyboard that I do n't know one 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.229
 of these remote controls and we will be able to play 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.419
 like minecraft pocket edition in fact 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.419
 with this remotes so I hope that 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.979
 this video has been very useful to you 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.900
 thank you for watching and I hope to 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.070
 see you soon on my sim channel 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.479

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.479
