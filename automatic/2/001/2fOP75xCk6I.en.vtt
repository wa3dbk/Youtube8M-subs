also a more practical point which is
that<00:03:38.110> these<00:03:38.620> size<00:03:39.550> of<00:03:40.030> containers<00:03:40.810> are<00:03:41.140> simply

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
that these size of containers are simply

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.430 
that these size of containers are simply
not<00:03:41.920> big<00:03:42.220> enough<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.580> dip<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.330> large<00:03:43.660> buffalo

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
not big enough to dip a large buffalo

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.490 
not big enough to dip a large buffalo
wing<00:03:44.709> into<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.150> i'm<00:03:46.300> surprised<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.140> didn't

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
wing into and i'm surprised that didn't

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.500 
wing into and i'm surprised that didn't
become<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.860> parent<00:03:48.489> than<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.640> testing<00:03:49.360> of

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
become a parent than the testing of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.710 
become a parent than the testing of
these<00:03:49.690> ahead<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.170> time<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.940> would<00:03:52.450> rate

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
these ahead of time so I would rate

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.759 
these ahead of time so I would rate
these<00:03:52.989> at<00:03:53.290> four<00:03:53.650> stars<00:03:54.100> out<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.519> five<00:03:54.970> and

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
these at four stars out of five and

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.220 
these at four stars out of five and
above-average<00:03:56.769> wing<00:03:57.430> but<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.600> really<00:03:58.930> would

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
above-average wing but it really would

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.199 
above-average wing but it really would
have<00:03:59.350> benefitted<00:04:00.040> from<00:04:00.070> having<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.850> special

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
have benefitted from having a special

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.550 
have benefitted from having a special
sauce<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:02.200> it

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
sauce with it

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.069 
sauce with it
so<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.829> hope<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.400> liked<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:03.850> video<00:04:04.150> share<00:04:05.049> it
