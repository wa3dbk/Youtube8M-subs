00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.090
 air this is a kawasaki r600 50 year old 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.160
 2012 model 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.270
 It is advisable to do maintenance 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.800
 every 500 1000 km maximum especially for 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.140
 yours of athens for the parts of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.230
 bolts varies for the chain 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.660
 we always recommend cleaning it with the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.000
 white oil a small brush is a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.090
 special container to lubricate 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.100
 with the appropriate lubricant for 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.090
 chains that is professional me 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.309
 I recommend and then execute calmly 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 I recommend putting on the protections 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.469
 both for the face and for the hands because 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.510
 is quite red with this because 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:58.000
 white wet the brush and go to 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 rub slowly on the chain for 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.649
 clean it completely from oxidation and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.979
 dirt that you can collect 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.229
 during your travels not 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.159
 worry if the oil touches the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:21.430
 rubber because in any case the rubber should be cleaned 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:25.710
 subsequently this however is one 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.710
 fairly clean chain 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 remember poor maintenance 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.439
 of your chain decreases his 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.770
 then at least 50 percent duration 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.430
 a chain that on average is between 15 and 25 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 thousand km could even break first 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 we definitely did almost that first 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 the whole tour 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 ok 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 all right we completed the tour 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.720
 now with a dry and non-dry cloth 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.190
 let the debris above all go to 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.190
 dry mounts fit together 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.900
 here it is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 this is what still came out of the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:48.470
 chain despite the white oil that 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:48.470
 which helped clean it up perfectly 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.250
 now we are slowly going to put the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 collective for the chain 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.310
 let's go here we are also from the see below 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.659
 effect does see should be 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.819
 perfectly clean and with a better one 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.640
 health 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:44.390
 also we can now go to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.489
 reassemble everything to reassemble this 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.040
 which we had closed to prevent the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:58.310
 white oil entry inside the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:04:07.370
 crisis and as we see the three screws e 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:23.949
 let's assemble everything before we go 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:23.949
 to put the iron here tightly closed 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
 we set the screws 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.770
 here a limit goes only to 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.120
 drive for a little and then once 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:58.060
 insert all inhabited slowly not 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.370
 immediately tighten a life and then insert 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.479
 in the others because it will propel 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.479
 threading of the others 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.389
 ok 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:25.809
 let's not squeeze hard let's go to shrink 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:36.819
 all before ok our pin is 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:46.469
 Once we are in place, we also tighten the third hour 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:49.899
 we can tighten for security 2 and 3 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:53.619
 with a screwdriver we insert the 

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:58.689
 pivot that must still make a light 

00:05:53.619 --> 00:06:01.689
 click here is perfect is the pin not 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.479
 are the most now let's check 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.349
 nuts and bolts vary because during 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.909
 getting off the road 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.849
 quietly so we have one 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.619
 controlled to the various to the various parts 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.229
 of the hull above all that they are the most 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:21.599
 stress the sides of the sidewalls but 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:24.819
 all the parts are tight 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.769
 front and also good 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.870
 tire pressure is important and goes 

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:30.430
 always checked especially in 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.259
 hot periods 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.139
 we have already checked it 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:39.459
 rear tire pressure around 2.5 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:41.559
 burrell front of the 23 the important thing is 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.229
 don't take it beyond the limits of the house 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:47.680
 constructor then exaggerate in the 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:51.360
 pressures a tire that holds well must 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.099
 have a pressure around 2.3 and 2.6 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.729
 too much flat tire can cause 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:59.349
 accidental falls or loss of grip 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.149
 this is the maintenance you normally do 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.860
 you have to do a bike of these 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.740
 displacements of this size 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.459
 I hope I have been helpful see you 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.180
 to the next 

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.180
 Hi guys
