00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.580 
on the upper body first and then the
lower<00:02:10.340> body<00:02:10.640> movement<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:12.379> way<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
lower body movement and that way you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
lower body movement and that way you
kind<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
kind of

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890 
kind of
see<00:02:13.610> what<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> whole<00:02:14.910> body<00:02:15.150> does<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
see what the whole body does all at the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.550 
see what the whole body does all at the
same<00:02:16.080> time

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
same time

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.479 
same time
okay<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.459> again<00:02:17.790> we're<00:02:18.630> picking<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.489> from

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
okay so again we're picking up from

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.839 
okay so again we're picking up from
where<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.450> would<00:02:21.840> normally<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.920> our<00:02:23.610> rack

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
where we would normally be in our rack

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.630 
where we would normally be in our rack
position<00:02:24.650> we're<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:26.040> repeating<00:02:26.370> our

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
position we're going to be repeating our

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.330 
position we're going to be repeating our
bar<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.090> from<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.569> position<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.680> difference

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
bar up from that position the difference

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.110 
bar up from that position the difference
between<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:30.239> push<00:02:30.930> press<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.620> say<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> clean<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
between a push press and say a clean and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.470 
between a push press and say a clean and
jerk<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:33.780> example<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.880> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
jerk for example is going to be the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
jerk for example is going to be the
position<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.500> hands<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.250> overhead

position of your hands and your overhead

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.890 
position of your hands and your overhead
transition<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> clean<00:02:41.030> you're<00:02:42.030> here<00:02:42.420> in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
transition with the clean you're here in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
transition with the clean you're here in
your<00:02:43.200> front<00:02:43.470> rack<00:02:43.650> position<00:02:44.120> with<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> push

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
your front rack position with a push

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
your front rack position with a push
press<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:46.410> actually<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.830> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.489> lower

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
press you're actually a little bit lower

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.210 
press you're actually a little bit lower
your<00:02:48.780> elbows<00:02:49.170> are<00:02:49.350> lower<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.830> weights<00:02:50.069> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
your elbows are lower your weights a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.039 
your elbows are lower your weights a
little<00:02:50.340> more<00:02:50.580> centered<00:02:50.880> into<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.480> hands<00:02:51.900> and

little more centered into your hands and
what<00:02:52.650> we're<00:02:52.860> doing<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.430> from<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.910> we're

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
what we're doing is but from here we're

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.360 
what we're doing is but from here we're
bending<00:02:54.720> those<00:02:55.019> knees<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.709> look<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
bending those knees on look you get a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.280 
bending those knees on look you get a
nice<00:02:56.580> wide<00:02:56.850> stance<00:02:57.150> we're<00:02:57.720> bending<00:02:57.989> our<00:02:58.260> knees

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
nice wide stance we're bending our knees

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.320 
nice wide stance we're bending our knees
and<00:02:58.799> we're<00:02:59.010> driving<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.640> weight<00:02:59.790> over<00:03:00.150> our

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and we're driving the weight over our

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.160 
and we're driving the weight over our
head<00:03:00.620> back<00:03:01.620> down<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.069> from<00:03:02.430> here<00:03:02.780> push<00:03:03.780> up

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
head back down and from here push up

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.350 
head back down and from here push up
over<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> head<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:07.100> by<00:03:08.100> doing<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.580> we're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
over the head so by doing that we're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.440 
over the head so by doing that we're
using<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.170> momentum<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:11.220> our<00:03:11.700> legs<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
using the momentum of our legs and the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.170 
using the momentum of our legs and the
strength<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.959> our<00:03:13.080> hips<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:14.310> propel<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.970> bar

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
strength of our hips to propel the bar

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.449 
strength of our hips to propel the bar
off<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.840> chest<00:03:16.190> boom

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459

wide base and your hip movement is your

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:44.630 
wide base and your hip movement is your
down<00:03:34.320> push<00:03:36.709> down<00:03:37.709> push<00:03:43.220> now<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.430> pretty

there's no secrets there's no no tricks
of<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> trade<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:51.180> get<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> great<00:03:51.959> push<00:03:52.260> press

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
of the trade to get a great push press

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
of the trade to get a great push press
it's<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.100> lots<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.489> practice<00:03:54.000> practice

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
it's just lots of practice practice

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.319 
it's just lots of practice practice
practice<00:03:54.620> now<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.220> also<00:03:56.430> mentioned<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:57.120> you

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
practice now you also mentioned that you

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.000 
practice now you also mentioned that you
train<00:03:57.569> by<00:03:57.780> yourself<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.470> then<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.829> little

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
train by yourself and then it's a little

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.780 
train by yourself and then it's a little
scary<00:03:59.519> going<00:03:59.819> overhead<00:04:01.069> with<00:04:02.069> some<00:04:02.340> serious

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
scary going overhead with some serious

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.340 
scary going overhead with some serious
weight<00:04:03.030> when<00:04:03.239> you're<00:04:03.359> here<00:04:03.600> by<00:04:03.750> yourself

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
weight when you're here by yourself

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.970 
weight when you're here by yourself
and<00:04:04.680> again<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.549> train<00:04:05.819> by<00:04:05.970> myself<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.510> lot<00:04:06.690> too

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
and again I train by myself a lot too

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.150 
and again I train by myself a lot too
and<00:04:07.980> one<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.519> things<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.030> learned<00:04:09.269> is

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
and one of the things that I learned is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.559 
and one of the things that I learned is
again<00:04:11.160> I'm<00:04:11.280> not<00:04:11.400> sure<00:04:11.609> where<00:04:12.000> you're<00:04:12.209> training

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
again I'm not sure where you're training

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.539 
again I'm not sure where you're training
if<00:04:13.139> you're<00:04:13.260> training<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.859> commercial<00:04:14.310> gym

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
if you're training in the commercial gym

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.789 
if you're training in the commercial gym
