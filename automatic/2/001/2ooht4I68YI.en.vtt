 two things at the same time gentlemen and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.889
 well that 's basically all in this 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.660
 first update of the control because 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.660
 there are going to be several updates 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.430
 in this is only a compatibility 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.250
 with the new headsets that are 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.420
 going out to the market some are the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.910
 Portuguese I do not know if the stars 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.970
 will take some for xbox one I guess 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.980
 yes then it is for compatibility 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.120
 so they can chat from their 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.530
 headset and another thing that I do not know if they see in 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.410
 this update I think not but 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.290
 will come later is a change in the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.740
 sensitivity of the controls of 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.110
 obviously and good stick are also going to 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.180
 be a little more precise the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.740
 updates that come for the 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.960
 control of xbox one the truth is that 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.090
 they are very well obviously they are always going to 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.160
 be to improve the gaming experience 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.100
 and obviously this can improve your 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.250
 control not to make it more precise and 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.220
 well let's say it benefits us 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.780
 we then gentlemen this this has 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.940
 everything has already finished updating is 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.560
 it's that easy if they have another control 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.360
 they do exactly the same thing 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.210
 they connect their headband and connect it to the 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.639
 microusb entry that comes in the part 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.430

 where the technology has arrived for 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.639
