there's no verses because I don't have

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
there's no verses because I don't have
another<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.920> marking<00:00:14.280> pulse<00:00:14.460> accessory<00:00:14.880> so

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
another we marking pulse accessory so

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.200 
another we marking pulse accessory so
I'm<00:00:15.150> just<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.540> show<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.350> road<00:00:16.619> race

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
I'm just going to show you the road race

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.750 
I'm just going to show you the road race
there<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.660> stage<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.710> stage<00:00:19.740> three<00:00:20.039> stage

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
there is one stage two stage three stage

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.529 
there is one stage two stage three stage
I<00:00:21.000> think<00:00:21.560> there's<00:00:22.560> different<00:00:22.769> places<00:00:23.539> that

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
I think there's different places that

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.900 
I think there's different places that
you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.869> race<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> risk<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> do

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you can race that for the risk to do

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.679 
you can race that for the risk to do
this<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:28.019> map<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:29.189> where<00:00:29.970> you're<00:00:30.179> racing<00:00:30.570> on

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
this like map out where you're racing on

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.280 
this like map out where you're racing on
Google<00:00:31.080> Island<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.369> matters

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
Google Island like it matters

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.330 
Google Island like it matters
it's<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.700> one<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> shorter<00:00:36.210> races

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
it's actually one of the shorter races

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.430 
it's actually one of the shorter races
over<00:00:38.340> bridge

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
over bridge

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.920 
over bridge
so<00:00:40.440> essentially<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.340> take<00:00:41.670> your<00:00:42.149> nunchuck

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so essentially you take your nunchuck

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.029 
so essentially you take your nunchuck
and<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.680> Wemo<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.210> back<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> forth

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
and your Wemo and you go back and forth

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
and your Wemo and you go back and forth
but<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.340> can't<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.360> forth<00:00:48.510> too<00:00:48.809> much

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
but you can't go back and forth too much

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
but you can't go back and forth too much
cross<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.039> will<00:00:50.219> lose<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.520> Scanlan<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
cross you will lose your Scanlan you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
cross you will lose your Scanlan you
lose<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.110> three<00:00:52.350> hearts<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.370> lose<00:00:53.520> them

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
lose you have three hearts you lose them

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.619 
lose you have three hearts you lose them

start in xxx when you try to get the
first<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.909> pretty<00:01:27.030> hard<00:01:27.270> game

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
first it's I think it's pretty hard game

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.219 
first it's I think it's pretty hard game
actually<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:29.149> haven't<00:01:30.149> really<00:01:30.630> gotten<00:01:31.110> the
