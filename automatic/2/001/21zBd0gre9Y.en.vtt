look for myself and I hope I can show
you<00:01:03.379> because<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.450> reflections<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you because of the reflections it's a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
you because of the reflections it's a
little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:07.920> problematically<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> hope<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
little bit problematically I hope you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.350 
little bit problematically I hope you
can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.600> those<00:01:09.869> tiny<00:01:10.830> sub<00:01:11.280> pixels<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> red

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
can see those tiny sub pixels the red

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
can see those tiny sub pixels the red
green<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.840> blue<00:01:13.560> ones<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:15.200> pens<00:01:16.200> side<00:01:17.189> by

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
green and blue ones like pens side by

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
green and blue ones like pens side by
side<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.330> definitely<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:20.070> dark

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
side so it's definitely it's going dark

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
side so it's definitely it's going dark
it's<00:01:21.000> definitely<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:22.850> pentile<00:01:23.850> matrix<00:01:24.140> it's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it's definitely not pentile matrix it's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429 
it's definitely not pentile matrix it's
normal<00:01:25.890> stripe<00:01:26.220> RGB<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> don't<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.170> any

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
normal stripe RGB so you don't have any

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.830 
normal stripe RGB so you don't have any
problems<00:01:29.159> controlling<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
problems controlling like that and like

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.700 
problems controlling like that and like

four gigabyte and it has NFC just 107
121<00:03:30.769> grams<00:03:30.799> so<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:31.810> one<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.079> reason

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.330 
in VGA so that's a problem I'm sorry for
that<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:43.549> only<00:03:43.760> bigger<00:03:44.629> issue<00:03:45.229> about<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:46.010> guess

one and the last one the young one is
the<00:04:00.079> galaxy<00:04:00.709> young<00:04:01.159> doers<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.680> can

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
the galaxy young doers and as you can

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.949 
the galaxy young doers and as you can
see<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:04.250> even<00:04:04.729> a<00:04:05.000> little<00:04:05.180> bit<00:04:05.389> smaller<00:04:05.659> the

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
see it's even a little bit smaller the

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.809 
see it's even a little bit smaller the
display<00:04:06.349> where<00:04:06.790> 3.2<00:04:07.790> inches<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.019> 320<00:04:09.859> by<00:04:10.040> 480

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
display where 3.2 inches and 320 by 480

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.140 
display where 3.2 inches and 320 by 480
pixels<00:04:11.780> it's<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.620> same<00:04:12.829> processor<00:04:13.370> like<00:04:13.879> in

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
pixels it's the same processor like in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.289 
pixels it's the same processor like in
the<00:04:14.299> fame<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:15.349> means<00:04:15.560> single<00:04:16.099> core<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.729> one

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the fame that means single core and one

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.750 
the fame that means single core and one
gigahertz<00:04:17.690> only<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:19.219> internal<00:04:19.609> memory

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
gigahertz only and the internal memory

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.759 
gigahertz only and the internal memory
again<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.450> four<00:04:20.779> gigabytes

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
again is four gigabytes

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.249 
again is four gigabytes
and<00:04:21.889> yes<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.729> can<00:04:22.910> open<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:24.020> have<00:04:24.229> a

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
and yes you can open it and you have a

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.860 
and yes you can open it and you have a
slot<00:04:24.710> for<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:25.069> micro<00:04:25.550> SD<00:04:25.970> card<00:04:26.240> over<00:04:26.629> here

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
slot for that micro SD card over here

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.850 
slot for that micro SD card over here
and<00:04:27.680> now<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.460> go<00:04:28.639> like<00:04:29.270> on<00:04:29.509> all<00:04:29.780> those<00:04:30.259> doors

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
and now you go like on all those doors

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.850 
and now you go like on all those doors
phones<00:04:31.460> from<00:04:31.729> galaxy<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.360> have<00:04:32.479> two<00:04:33.229> slots

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
phones from galaxy you have two slots

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.510 
phones from galaxy you have two slots
for<00:04:34.069> SIM<00:04:34.599> cards<00:04:35.599> but<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:35.930> not<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.500> micro<00:04:37.069> SD

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
for SIM cards but it's not a micro SD

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.570 
for SIM cards but it's not a micro SD

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
and micro SIM it's mini sim so the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.689 
and micro SIM it's mini sim so the
