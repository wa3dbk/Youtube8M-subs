play<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.860> monarchs<00:02:34.460> but<00:02:34.580> with<00:02:34.850> ting<00:02:35.300> you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
play this in monarchs but with ting you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.410 
play this in monarchs but with ting you
it's<00:02:36.050> just<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.950> need<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.490> now<00:02:37.670> has<00:02:38.090> taken

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's just that you need it now has taken

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.230 
it's just that you need it now has taken
you<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.750> go<00:02:38.930> away<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.260> fast<00:02:39.680> now<00:02:40.640> people<00:02:41.209> just

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you they go away so fast now people just

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.120 
you they go away so fast now people just
they<00:02:41.690> don't<00:02:41.720> want<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.530> goes<00:02:42.740> away<00:02:42.860> fast

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
they don't want it so it goes away fast

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.730 
they don't want it so it goes away fast
and<00:02:43.490> then<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:44.380> recycle<00:02:45.380> them<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
and then you recycle them with the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.400 
and then you recycle them with the
average<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:46.790> also<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.390> your<00:02:47.540> formula

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
average and then also for your formula

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.940 
average and then also for your formula
synchron's<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.209> it's<00:02:50.420> basically

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
synchron's to so then it's basically

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.780 
synchron's to so then it's basically
even<00:02:51.950> more<00:02:52.130> better<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.950> soul<00:02:55.250> exchange<00:02:55.459> just

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
even more better to soul exchange just

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.750 
even more better to soul exchange just
before<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.150> would<00:02:56.450> say<00:02:56.660> donut<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.290> monarch<00:02:58.190> deck

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
before I would say donut a monarch deck

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.979 
before I would say donut a monarch deck
needs<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.209> play<00:02:59.360> three<00:02:59.720> but<00:03:00.319> now<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.920> them

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
needs to play three but now with them

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.310 
needs to play three but now with them
tangu<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.680> much<00:03:03.860> consistent<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.320> you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
tangu it's so much consistent and you

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.500 
tangu it's so much consistent and you
really<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:07.340> they<00:03:07.580> throw<00:03:07.760> out<00:03:07.970> wing<00:03:08.270> goes

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
really if they throw out wing goes

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.570 
really if they throw out wing goes
against<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.440> they<00:03:09.470> throw<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.100> fossil

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
against you and they throw out fossil

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.800 
against you and they throw out fossil
deniz<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:10.970> can<00:03:11.470> attack<00:03:12.470> with<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.769> tangu<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
deniz you can attack with the tangu and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.140 
deniz you can attack with the tangu and
kill<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> monster<00:03:15.320> so<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:16.519> isn't<00:03:16.850> as<00:03:16.970> bad

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
kill the monster so this isn't as bad

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.540 
kill the monster so this isn't as bad
two<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.200> good<00:03:18.290> i<00:03:18.470> wouldn't<00:03:18.920> go<00:03:19.010> down<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.310> one

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
two is good i wouldn't go down to one

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.360 
two is good i wouldn't go down to one
but<00:03:20.030> i<00:03:20.360> want<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.959> go<00:03:21.050> up<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.230> three<00:03:21.440> or<00:03:21.650> we'll<00:03:21.860> go

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
but i want to go up to three or we'll go

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.460 
but i want to go up to three or we'll go
down<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.610> one<00:03:22.820> because<00:03:23.239> three<00:03:24.019> is<00:03:24.140> too<00:03:24.320> much

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
down to one because three is too much

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.700 
down to one because three is too much
and<00:03:24.680> one<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:24.980> too<00:03:25.220> less<00:03:25.610> for<00:03:25.940> me<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.010> you're<00:03:28.160> not

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
and one is too less for me so you're not

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.710 
and one is too less for me so you're not
and<00:03:28.890> then<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.210> just<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.570> get<00:03:30.690> out

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
and then so one for one just to get out

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.100 
and then so one for one just to get out
you're<00:03:30.960> seeing<00:03:31.200> you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
you're seeing you

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.970 
you're seeing you
1<00:03:32.560> stars<00:03:32.860> faster<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.820> giant<00:03:34.750> shoe<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:34.960> a<00:03:35.080> dark

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
1 stars faster a giant shoe in a dark

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.290 
1 stars faster a giant shoe in a dark
hole<00:03:36.780> stable<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.380> monstery<00:03:38.770> more<00:03:39.300> stable

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
hole stable and a monstery more stable

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.340 
hole stable and a monstery more stable
so<00:03:41.110> there's<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.440> bag<00:03:41.620> 41<00:03:42.040> cards<00:03:43.050> now<00:03:44.050> for<00:03:44.260> the
