00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
unbeatable value but unfortunately it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
unbeatable value but unfortunately it
has<00:01:00.690> been<00:01:00.899> hard<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> find<00:01:01.649> since<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> early

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
has been hard to find since the early

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.299 
has been hard to find since the early
80s<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.899> almost<00:01:04.199> impossible<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
80s and now it's almost impossible to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.450 
80s and now it's almost impossible to
get<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.180> land<00:01:06.960> mine<00:01:07.290> industries<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.130> proud

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
get but land mine industries are proud

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.899 
get but land mine industries are proud
to<00:01:08.490> announce<00:01:09.020> my<00:01:10.020> loss<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.439> each<00:01:10.560> mulch<00:01:10.950> now<00:01:11.700> my

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to announce my loss of each mulch now my

to announce my loss of each mulch now my
Lhasa<00:01:12.119> bitch<00:01:12.390> mulch<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> bulk<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> bone

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
Lhasa bitch mulch is a bulk and bone

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
Lhasa bitch mulch is a bulk and bone
meal<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> slightly<00:01:15.330> coarse<00:01:15.780> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
meal and has a slightly coarse of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.109 
meal and has a slightly coarse of
texture<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> pole<00:01:16.950> potting<00:01:17.340> mix<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.000> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
texture than the pole potting mix but is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.820 
texture than the pole potting mix but is
much<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.630> refined<00:01:19.049> than<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> cheaper

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
much more refined than the cheaper

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.990 
much more refined than the cheaper
brands<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.939> African<00:01:21.479> stuff<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.700> don't

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
brands like that African stuff and don't

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
brands like that African stuff and don't
be<00:01:24.119> stingy<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.750> cuz<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.530> plenty

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
be stingy with it cuz there's plenty

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.450 
be stingy with it cuz there's plenty
more<00:01:26.130> where<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> came<00:01:26.790> from<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> earlier<00:01:29.130> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
more where that came from now earlier on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
more where that came from now earlier on
in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> week<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.180> went<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> factory<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
in the week I went out to the factory to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.810 
in the week I went out to the factory to
have<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> look<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.520> bag<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
have a look at how this little bag of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.120 
have a look at how this little bag of
wonder<00:01:33.240> comes<00:01:33.479> about

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.789 

so<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.850> is<00:01:40.000> where<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.299> process<00:01:40.780> begins<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
so this is where the process begins the

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.649 
so this is where the process begins the
raw<00:01:42.009> materials<00:01:42.700> are<00:01:42.850> broken<00:01:43.240> down<00:01:43.390> into

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
raw materials are broken down into

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.200 
raw materials are broken down into
different<00:01:43.899> bins<00:01:44.409> depending<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.430> origin<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
different bins depending on origin and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.289 
different bins depending on origin and
quality<00:01:47.049> I<00:01:47.729> probably<00:01:48.729> shouldn't<00:01:49.030> be<00:01:49.090> telling

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
quality I probably shouldn't be telling

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.999 
quality I probably shouldn't be telling
you<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.509> but<00:01:49.689> I<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.200> say<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.439> heard<00:01:50.740> them

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
you this but I just say to heard them

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.830 
you this but I just say to heard them
talking<00:01:51.520> about<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.880> probability<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.659> a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
talking about the probability of a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.990 
talking about the probability of a
Macedonian<00:01:53.679> product<00:01:54.070> being<00:01:54.579> available

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
Macedonian product being available

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.360 
Macedonian product being available
before<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.810> end<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.140> year

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.420 

so<00:02:04.000> from<00:02:04.270> those<00:02:04.480> bins<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.380> raw<00:02:05.590> materials

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so from those bins the raw materials

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.600 
so from those bins the raw materials
make<00:02:06.730> their<00:02:06.970> way<00:02:07.150> down<00:02:07.180> here<00:02:07.810> as<00:02:08.400> you<00:02:09.400> can<00:02:09.430> see

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
make their way down here as you can see

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.080 
make their way down here as you can see
this<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.810> where<00:02:11.020> they<00:02:11.200> churn<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.950> broken<00:02:12.820> down

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
this is where they churn and broken down
