00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello people with you mouse and this is the ninth 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.309
 the release of crash test transmissions we experience 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.730
 on the strength of a different technique from our 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.429
 games 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 but not in this release because 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.790
 you are in the comments 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 expressed a desire to test the power of a mine 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.410
 top british fri-shki fv215b 183 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.810
 and we will check as follows 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.390
 we take 15 lt from the first to the eighth 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.760
 level we build them in three ranks 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 five people and not gold mine 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.899
 shoot at the center stands ltshku 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.690
 note that you need to shoot carefully 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.969
 so that the landmine does not break through lte and explosion 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 happened outside the tank so we decided 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.200
 shoot the caterpillar and get it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 crash test thank the player with a nickname 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.270
 walking and giving him 1000 gold 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 sort of explained everything we can 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 start the first test and here we took 15 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.410
 tractors since this lt shki on 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.710
 first level most points 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.829
 strength 130 how do you think whether 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.829
 flash drive with one shot destroy all lt 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.450
 no only 11 tanks and 1695 damage i 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.320
 I think with a golden projectile could be 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.740
 beat out strike 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.980
 go to the second test here we have 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.040
 lt 2 levels in which and pyshechka more 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:30.040
 then the damage will be higher right now 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.580
 find out go to 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.730
 damage is really more in 1912 but 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.870
 frags will be less than 7 go 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.420
 to third test 3 third level test 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:50.220
 alt and step without further ado let's just 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.680
 Shoot and on fire 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 2189 damage and 6 destroyed tanks 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.650
 feel the damage grows slowly 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.350
 go further 4 test and here we already 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.240
 plump utyazhki and this means that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.430
 there must be more damage 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.430
 but how much more do you think 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 3016 damage 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.170
 but only two frags go to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.019
 the next test is test number 5 and it is not difficult 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.510
 guess what lt level 5 will be here 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:35.519
 how many frags and damage can flash drive 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:37.799
 cause them the answer 3000 488 damage and 5 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.189
 destroyed tanks heading to 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.489
 the sixth test where you are waiting for us 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:51.120
 country and lt level 6 can our pt 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:55.079
 break your record how do you think to 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.510
 Unfortunately there is no 3173 damage and only 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.920
 one fragment go to the last one 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.730
 dough namely to seventh slt seventh 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.590
 level look how sweet they are 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.659
 I just want to throw there a fugasik 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.659

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:20.109

 go to the last test number test 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.700
 eight top 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.069
 and most tenacious ltshke how much damage 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.650
 It will be applied this time and whether 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:38.769

 3313 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.389

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.129
