you get research points for getting rid

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.620 
you get research points for getting rid
of<00:03:51.160> them<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.549> it's<00:03:52.239> not<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.480> worst<00:03:52.630> thing<00:03:53.160> and

category every light different job type
and<00:06:28.479> then<00:06:28.990> you<00:06:29.289> can<00:06:29.440> make<00:06:29.620> a<00:06:29.649> hardware

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
and then you can make a hardware

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.670 
and then you can make a hardware
engineer<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.930> with<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.020> hardware<00:06:32.259> engineer

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
engineer and with the hardware engineer

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.200 
engineer and with the hardware engineer
you<00:06:32.770> can<00:06:32.949> develop<00:06:33.399> a<00:06:33.610> console

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
you can develop a console

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.330 
you can develop a console
and<00:06:34.389> that's<00:06:34.600> not<00:06:34.750> until<00:06:35.139> later<00:06:35.319> on<00:06:35.410> for<00:06:35.860> me<00:06:36.069> in

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
and that's not until later on for me in

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.840 
and that's not until later on for me in
this<00:06:36.880> game<00:06:37.150> but<00:06:37.620> so<00:06:38.620> you<00:06:38.979> can<00:06:39.130> make<00:06:39.220> a<00:06:39.280> console

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
this game but so you can make a console

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.939 
this game but so you can make a console
and<00:06:39.970> that's<00:06:40.120> really<00:06:40.509> helpful<00:06:40.990> in<00:06:41.470> some<00:06:41.770> extra

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
and that's really helpful in some extra

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.270 
and that's really helpful in some extra
sales<00:06:42.370> and<00:06:43.349> then<00:06:44.349> once<00:06:44.680> you<00:06:44.800> have<00:06:44.889> a<00:06:44.919> hardware

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
sales and then once you have a hardware

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.409 
sales and then once you have a hardware
engineer<00:06:45.669> and<00:06:45.789> you<00:06:45.849> get<00:06:46.000> the<00:06:46.120> hardware

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
engineer and you get the hardware

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.999 
engineer and you get the hardware
engineer<00:06:46.810> to<00:06:46.930> level<00:06:47.169> 5<00:06:47.349> you<00:06:47.530> can<00:06:47.560> get<00:06:47.740> a<00:06:47.770> hacker

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
engineer to level 5 you can get a hacker

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.879 
engineer to level 5 you can get a hacker
so<00:06:48.509> hackers<00:06:49.509> are<00:06:49.630> the<00:06:49.720> best<00:06:49.960> type<00:06:50.860> of

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
so hackers are the best type of

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.540 
so hackers are the best type of
employees<00:06:51.819> you<00:06:51.910> can<00:06:51.940> get<00:06:52.770> so<00:06:53.770> yeah<00:06:54.400> that's

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
employees you can get so yeah that's

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.629 
employees you can get so yeah that's
pretty<00:06:54.669> much<00:06:54.880> the<00:06:55.300> whole<00:06:56.490> everything<00:06:57.490> in<00:06:57.580> this

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
pretty much the whole everything in this

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.199 
pretty much the whole everything in this
game<00:06:57.910> yeah<00:06:58.479> see<00:06:59.110> ya
