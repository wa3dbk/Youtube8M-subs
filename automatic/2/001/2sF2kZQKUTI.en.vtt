00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.200
 good day want to give or company from 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
 reg today was not very kind 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.280
 Now on the territory of our channel 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 there are power representatives 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.529
 investigative committee and center for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.769
 counter terrorism explained to us 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.689
 what is the purpose of the presence of the security forces 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 And this is quite a large number 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.289
 people including a lot of people 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.960
 dressed booty 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 to full to full combat form and with 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 machines and they are now 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.680
 in almost every office so 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.160
 purpose their presence is seizures any 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.020
 Information on the events of February 26 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.330
 when the walls of the Crimean Parliament 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.060
 held a rally with the participation of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.710
 Crimean Tatars despite the fact that earlier 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.560
 we provided the investigative committee 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 and center to counter extremism 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.690
 all the information that we have 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.630
 requested 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.070
 today was someone apparently upstairs 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.280
 decided to hold this 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.650
 power share apparently our fault 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.060
 tv channel is that like all 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 other media 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.430
 covered these events we do not know what 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 end today's events but rather 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 all we have to turn off the server and the other 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.760
 technique and to r 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.530
 but at least for a while I 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.250
 I hope it is not for not forever 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.380
 could not go on the air according to our data 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 this action is most likely planned and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 organized by the Crimean government 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.770
 occasionally from r experienced pressure 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 on force sanctions against our 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.460
 TV channel still not decided 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 apply as we did not break 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 and did not break the law but apparently the current 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.659
 Crimean government does not suit itself 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.940
 the existence of uncontrolled and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.560
 TV channel power apparently does not suit 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.930
 the very existence of the first and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.330
 the world's only Crimean Tatar 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.880
 TV channel whose main goal is not 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.850
 language preservation and development policy 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.220
 the culture of his people power apparently not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.610
 satisfied with the existence of the channel as 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.750
 one of the main factors 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.940
 information presence of the Crimean 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.129
 Tatars on the peninsula of their full 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 homecoming after half a century 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.260
 deportations and the complexity of the first 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.629
 decades in a row and I don't know how after 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.939
 closure from toyota tr if there are such 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.250
 plans power will look straight eyes 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.200
 Crimean Tatars I do not know how these 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.689
 actions correlate with presidential decree 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.879
 Russia about the rehabilitation of the deportees 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.709
 peoples including the Crimean Tatars I 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.170
 I want to remind only one statement 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.569
 Vladimir Putin made them in the most 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.659
 the eve of the 70th anniversary of the deportation to Sochi 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.480
 It was May 16 when Putin said that 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.940
 cash registers for the rehabilitation of the Crimean Tatars 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.670
 for the progressive development of this 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.579
 people, however, I better quote the beginning 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.250
 quotes I very much hope to say 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.069
 Vladimir Putin that he decree will 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.500
 the basis of systematic activities related 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.480
 with cultural political rehabilitation 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 Rehabilitation is related to 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.099
 establish normal life activity 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.319
 create conditions for progressive 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.040
 development kramz Tatar people on 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.239
 to their homeland 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.980
 end of quotation we also counted on it 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.019
 but these calculations as well as cultural 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.030
 normal rehabilitation 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.730
 livelihood progressive 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.160
 development that are impossible without 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.269
 of the existence of single crimes 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.819
 Tatar channel 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.340
 apparently not satisfied with the local government 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.919
 canceling missing on May 18 she banned 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.819
 Crimean Tatars cry now she 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:40.790
 apparently wants to forbid them to hear 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.949
 and talk but we still have about 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.090
 expressively native land which we have 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.579
 no one takes 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.010
 and as long as we are alive we will be all legitimate 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.079
 ways to fight for 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.870
 Crimean Tatars survived 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.660
 their national television channel so we are not 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.519
 we say goodbye and wait for the development of events and 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.720
 further action by local authorities 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.930
 which i hope 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.579
 is aware of what blow she strikes 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.590
 not only in the Crimean Tatars 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.109
 but also by their own reputation and 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.030
 reputation of the federal government follow 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.030
 while it is possible for our airs
