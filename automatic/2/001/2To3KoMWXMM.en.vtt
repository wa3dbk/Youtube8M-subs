00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
really catch that well but if you user

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.860 
really catch that well but if you user
him<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.920> really<00:02:51.950> didn't<00:02:52.670> matter<00:02:52.820> he<00:02:53.630> could

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
him it really didn't matter he could

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
him it really didn't matter he could
just<00:02:54.080> intercept<00:02:54.770> he<00:02:55.190> could<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:55.640> jump<00:02:55.940> higher

than<00:02:56.210> anybody<00:02:57.050> else<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.710> was<00:02:57.860> awesome<00:02:58.340> to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
able to strafe you've got to be able to

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.420 
able to strafe you've got to be able to
pick<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> ball<00:03:58.569> up<00:03:58.629> force<00:03:59.290> turnovers<00:03:59.620> you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
pick the ball up force turnovers you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.490 
pick the ball up force turnovers you
really<00:04:00.879> just<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.359> even<00:04:01.689> out<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.260> game

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
really just have to even out the game

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.729 
really just have to even out the game
yet<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.790> have<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.299> do<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.140> think<00:04:05.530> they

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
yet you have to do that and I think they

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.949 
yet you have to do that and I think they
will<00:04:06.010> they've<00:04:06.370> got<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.790> engine<00:04:07.299> down<00:04:07.569> I

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
will they've got the engine down I

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.990 
will they've got the engine down I
really<00:04:08.319> like<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.709> physics<00:04:09.129> I<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.489> all<00:04:09.700> that

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
really like the physics I like all that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.809 
really like the physics I like all that
not<00:04:10.599> gonna<00:04:10.780> crap<00:04:11.079> on<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.829> think<00:04:12.549> that's

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
not gonna crap on it I think that's

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.300 
not gonna crap on it I think that's
great<00:04:13.120> just<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.290> defense<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.040> will<00:04:15.159> be

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
great just the defense and will be

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.670 
great just the defense and will be
offset<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.570> big<00:04:16.840> big<00:04:17.079> hopes<00:04:17.410> for<00:04:17.560> Madden<00:04:17.949> 14<00:04:19.680> my

a<00:04:35.830> great<00:04:36.070> game<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:36.610> that's<00:04:36.759> why<00:04:36.940> I'm<00:04:37.060> showing

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
a great game so that's why I'm showing

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
a great game so that's why I'm showing
it<00:04:37.599> I'm<00:04:38.080> gonna<00:04:38.229> shoot<00:04:38.500> him<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.770> message<00:04:38.949> just

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
it I'm gonna shoot him a message just

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.189 
it I'm gonna shoot him a message just
because<00:04:39.729> this<00:04:39.880> game<00:04:40.090> was<00:04:40.240> played<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.479> long<00:04:40.840> long

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
because this game was played a long long

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.689 
because this game was played a long long
time<00:04:41.470> ago<00:04:41.770> he<00:04:41.889> probably<00:04:42.160> doesn't<00:04:42.639> even

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
time ago he probably doesn't even

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.790 
time ago he probably doesn't even
remember<00:04:42.880> it<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:43.900> it<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.139> definitely<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.620> good

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.560 
remember it but it was definitely a good
one<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.010> goes<00:04:45.310> down<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.729> wire<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.330> one

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
one that goes down to the wire and one

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.510 
one that goes down to the wire and one
that<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.289> just<00:04:47.770> wanted<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.099> share<00:04:48.340> with
