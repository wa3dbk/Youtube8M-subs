00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.320
 In the early 1990s, SEGA was the only company that really challenged Nintendo, the market that controls the gaming game market. 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.320
 Genesis is the host responsible for confrontation 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.880
 Since the introduction of the North American market in 1989, until 1997. It seriously divided the market of Nintendo 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.480
 There are two versions of SEGA Genesis that everyone may be familiar with now. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 Model 1 is the original version. It's big and has some weird features. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.360
 "High-resolution image"? One headphone jack... volume control? 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.320
 Anyway~~ 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.380
 SEGA launched the Genesis Model 2 in 1993. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.580
 It's lighter and has stereo, the most common host version. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.580
 But in 1998, there were stores that started selling this product: 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.740
 Genesis 3? what? 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.640
 Majaesco sells Genesis 3 under the license of Sega under the model number MK-1461 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.620
 It comes with a six-button controller and retails for about $50 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.340
 Who is Majesco now? Er.. They are a video game publisher. Actually still exists until now 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 But back in the 1990s, their main focus was on replaying games. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.100
 It is said that the company will buy games that canâ€™t be sold from publishers. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.000
 Repack them, change the labels, and sell them. And all these actions are licensed by the original publisher. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.060
 Some famous Majesco heavy products include [Super Devil City IV], [Sonic Kid 3D] and [Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck] 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.700
 The biggest difference in Majesco's remastered version is packaging. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.140
 They are always sold in carton packs, and the manual is black and white. 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 It should also print "Assembling in Mexico" somewhere on the box. 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.520
 If you are buying a nostalgic game, you may buy Majesco remake at least once. 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.820
 Majesco is also responsible for the re-engineering of the SEGA GG mainframe in 2000. 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400
 So go back to Genesis 3. Let's take a look at the host itself 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 First of all, it is small, almost no weight 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.560
 Maybe even too light. Seriously, if you pull your controller a little, flying from the shelf may happen. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.160
 The host also lacks LED lights, similar to the other two redesigned hosts I mentioned earlier (referred to as NES and SNES). 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.440
 However, the Majesco mainframe is nice to have a bright orange display under the switch. 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.260
 Let you know if the host is open 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.960
 The cassette slots are also different. It has been modified so you can plug the game of Japan Mega Drive into the host 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.420
 As long as the game has no lock zone, you can play 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.240
 No need to change machine or converter 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.840
 The main unit contains a composite output plug and a power plug 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.960
 The wires you use on the Genesis 2 can also be used on this host. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.140
 Genesis 3 also has some internal fixes. 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.560
 In previous models, Genesis had a bug in the host's memory controller. 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 This was fixed in Model 3. 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:23.160
 But some games actually use this bug, such as [Night Dragon], which means that these games can't be played on Genesis 3. 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320
 Now let's take a look at some of the removed parts. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.000
 Genesis 3 lacks expansion terminals, so the Sega CD is not compatible. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.480
 It also cannot use Sega 32X, Power Base Converter or Galoob's Game Genie 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.860
 Any game that uses an extra processor will not work, such as [VR Racing] 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.780
 Overall, Sega Genesis 3 is a good version of this 16-bit host. 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.840
 Especially for new players, or for players who want to save some space. 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.840
 However, some games and hardware add-ons are not suitable for this host at all. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 Forget about it. This thing is just a Genesis. 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.860
 Their value today is between $30 and $40, but they are a bit hard to find. 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.240
 Majesco only sells the host for about a year. 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.880
 By the end of the year, they sold them for $19.99. 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.860
 Wow 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.720
 So should you buy a Genesis 3? Um.. I hope this video can help you make a decision. 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.660
