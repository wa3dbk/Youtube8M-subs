00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.150
 the c1000 and long lines with the empty shelves last Wednesday 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.340
 mushroom last opened the super is taken over by albert 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.979
 hey 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 The acquisition was part of a nationwide that even among more than 50 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.589
 c1000 branches must give way to albert heijn some paths have poulus 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.589
 difficulty in a case where it remains possible 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.489
 I prefer 2012 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.890
 I also do not understand very well why but her who must be out because 

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.890
 they are in the cell nearby 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.380
 And no, you will get a monopoly from but hey 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.620
 I don't think that's a good thing 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.840
 although not everyone is against it 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.560
 the effect 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.140
 9 right ankle 2008 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.620
 take a lot against it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.839
 that the customer focused 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.420
 much, much friendlier 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.060
 the pit 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.020
 at the moment there are fifteen albert heijn branches in the city with them still 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.260
 two new stores in the planning 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340
 the big grocers even have a monopoly position within the deep ring 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.690
 The supermarket chain is now by far the largest in Groningen and only at a distance 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.070
 follows directly knows super the farmer with seven branches 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.740
 to make it all right in the bowl 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.600
 took three reasons 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.049
 the power of a supermarket that may always be based on the a brands 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.260
 that they have their own brands what now also an I sat point is they have whole 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.840
 nice advertising campaign so that you look at the climate school of the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.750
 shop yourself 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.730
 albert heijn died to a significant degree 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.610
 very nice a campaign that with that final the manager another child and one 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 of the variants assignment with find it a nice advertisement 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.250
 frits van der heijden has 25 years as femsa is there for albert heijn 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.950
 worked 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.560
 he even wrote a book about it 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.540
 and now he guides both his sons who have two branches of Albert Heijn and the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.970
 national highway 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.070
 the newest of these is also a former C1000 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.090
 two branches in one street and seems a lot, but according to van der heijden first 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 consumers happy with it 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.330
 look beyond the second round 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.150
 score much higher than a 2000 the match so the that made especially the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.770
 rider 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.670
 According to the marketing expert, we are not there yet 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.330
 and slightly lurking competition such as the same bar 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.829
 actually one of my better albert heijn is from the area with 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.920
 and there are muse of jumbo but the demo shows that it can be even better 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.499
 That's never good here by confirming the numbers 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.449
 In the past four years, the retail chain has been chosen by consumers 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.930
 to best supermarket
