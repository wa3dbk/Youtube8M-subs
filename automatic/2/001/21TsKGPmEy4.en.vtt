just<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> weaken<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> enough<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> gets<00:01:22.380> down

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
just to weaken it enough so it gets down

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.060 
just to weaken it enough so it gets down
by<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.460> rocket<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.680> him<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
by one rocket you can see him do that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.040 
by one rocket you can see him do that
here<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> second

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.500 

and<00:01:32.260> then<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:32.890> shoot<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.310> rocket<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:33.820> i<00:01:34.240> miss

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
and then I shoot the rocket and i miss

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.370 
and then I shoot the rocket and i miss
because<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.350> fail<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.600> shoot<00:01:37.600> another<00:01:37.810> rocket

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
because I fail and shoot another rocket

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.030 
because I fail and shoot another rocket
and<00:01:38.590> I'm<00:01:39.580> not<00:01:39.850> sure<00:01:40.120> how<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.690> went<00:01:40.900> down

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and I'm not sure how it went down

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.820 
and I'm not sure how it went down
because<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.630> can't<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.470> with<00:01:44.650> just

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
because I you can't do that with just

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.310 
because I you can't do that with just
bullets<00:01:45.640> so<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.030> don't<00:01:46.210> know<00:01:46.270> there's<00:01:46.990> always<00:01:47.170> a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
bullets so I don't know there's always a

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.500 
bullets so I don't know there's always a
guy<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.980> right<00:01:48.010> always<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:48.940> every<00:01:49.270> single

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
guy to the right always is every single

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.290

time<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.780> played<00:01:50.020> there's<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.890> guy<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.190> right

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
time I played there's a guy to the right

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.810
