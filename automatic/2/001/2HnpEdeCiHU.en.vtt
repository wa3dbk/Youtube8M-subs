allow<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.770> able<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.340> what

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
allow all of you to be able to see what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.569 
allow all of you to be able to see what
I<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.320> cause<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:41.009> much<00:01:41.189> pain

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I see so it would not cause as much pain

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
I see so it would not cause as much pain
and<00:01:41.880> angst<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.780> watch<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.290> pet
