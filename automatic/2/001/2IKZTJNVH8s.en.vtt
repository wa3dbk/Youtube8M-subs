over<00:03:10.739> his<00:03:10.889> nose<00:03:11.540> because<00:03:12.540> his<00:03:13.470> parents<00:03:13.680> were

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
over his nose because his parents were

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.879 
over his nose because his parents were
embarrassed<00:03:14.400> ashamed<00:03:15.389> of<00:03:15.840> them<00:03:15.989> there's<00:03:16.799> a

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
embarrassed ashamed of them there's a

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.000 
embarrassed ashamed of them there's a
his<00:03:17.609> tail<00:03:17.910> serves<00:03:18.569> as<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> switch<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
his tail serves as the switch for the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.129 
his tail serves as the switch for the
light<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> see<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:23.250> does<00:03:23.549> nothing

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
light as you can see it does nothing

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.050 
light as you can see it does nothing
there<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> battery<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:25.829> his<00:03:26.160> carcass<00:03:26.519> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
there is a battery in his carcass that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.589

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
if you open up his belly I guess there's

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.759 
if you open up his belly I guess there's
no<00:03:30.690> other<00:03:30.720> place<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.169> could<00:03:31.260> really<00:03:31.379> put<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
no other place you could really put it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.300

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you could put the batteries in there but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.849 
you could put the batteries in there but
yeah<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.480> doesn't<00:03:36.900> work<00:03:37.109> such<00:03:37.919> a<00:03:37.949> shame

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859

Rudolph's<00:03:55.979> head<00:03:56.220> does<00:03:56.609> rotate<00:03:56.909> despite<00:03:57.900> the

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
Rudolph's head does rotate despite the

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.839 
Rudolph's head does rotate despite the
fact<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.349> he<00:03:58.500> has<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> light<00:03:59.069> feature<00:03:59.400> which<00:03:59.729> I

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
fact that he has a light feature which I

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.420 
fact that he has a light feature which I
like<00:04:00.650> doesn't<00:04:01.650> look<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.069> ball<00:04:02.220> joint

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
like doesn't look like it's a ball joint

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.309 
like doesn't look like it's a ball joint
just<00:04:02.760> swivels<00:04:03.209> back<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.510> forth<00:04:03.780> he<00:04:03.989> has<00:04:04.139> these

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
just swivels back and forth he has these

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.599 
just swivels back and forth he has these
swivel<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.889> his<00:04:05.040> legs<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.949> can<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.159> have<00:04:08.519> him

flying<00:04:10.190> or<00:04:11.190> leaping<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.940> guess<00:04:12.120> he'd<00:04:12.329> be

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
flying or leaping I guess he'd be

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.569 
flying or leaping I guess he'd be
leaping<00:04:12.750> by<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.319> point<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.040> movie<00:04:14.310> in

know the worst thing with DVD movies is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.210 
know the worst thing with DVD movies is
that<00:04:41.940> when<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.020> on<00:04:43.169> TV<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.800> go<00:04:43.949> out<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.130> your

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220

way to watch it when you have it on DVD

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
the O's seem to put off and put off and

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.090 
the O's seem to put off and put off and
put<00:04:48.240> off<00:04:48.389> watching<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.229> that's<00:04:49.830> what<00:04:50.009> I've

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.420 
done that's what this guy is done with
watching<00:04:52.259> Rudolph<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.860> am<00:04:53.039> gonna<00:04:53.220> make

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
watching Rudolph but I am gonna make

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.629 
watching Rudolph but I am gonna make
some<00:04:54.030> efforts<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.990> watch<00:04:55.800> Rudolph<00:04:56.160> this<00:04:56.430> year

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
some efforts to watch Rudolph this year

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.339 
some efforts to watch Rudolph this year
I<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.979> this<00:04:59.190> toy<00:04:59.460> quite<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.820> bit<00:05:00.060> and

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
I do like this toy quite a bit and

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.409 
I do like this toy quite a bit and
certainly<00:05:01.349> if<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.710> move<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.430> misfit<00:05:02.970> doll<00:05:03.180> out

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
certainly if I move the misfit doll out

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.150 
certainly if I move the misfit doll out
of<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.599> way<00:05:03.720> when<00:05:04.289> we<00:05:04.349> put<00:05:04.560> Rudolph<00:05:04.949> here

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
of the way when we put Rudolph here

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.670 
of the way when we put Rudolph here
certainly<00:05:08.160> this<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.759> a<00:05:08.789> prime<00:05:09.389> opportunity

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
certainly this is a prime opportunity

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.770 
certainly this is a prime opportunity
that<00:05:10.680> if<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.889> had<00:05:11.070> this<00:05:11.520> guy<00:05:14.479> you<00:05:15.479> could<00:05:15.630> have

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
that if you had this guy you could have

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.170 
that if you had this guy you could have
both<00:05:16.320> hermie<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.280> Bru<00:05:17.940> Dolf<00:05:18.150> together<00:05:19.639> Fame

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.930 

but<00:05:24.180> a<00:05:24.240> great<00:05:24.840> little<00:05:25.169> set<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:26.460> certainly<00:05:26.849> in

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
but a great little set and certainly in

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.249 
but a great little set and certainly in
Rudolph<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.449> could<00:05:27.570> probably<00:05:27.780> have<00:05:28.020> picked

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
Rudolph you could probably have picked

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.749 
Rudolph you could probably have picked
up<00:05:28.380> just<00:05:28.530> on<00:05:28.710> his<00:05:28.889> own<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.280> have<00:05:29.430> him<00:05:29.639> on

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
up just on his own and have him on

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.089 
up just on his own and have him on
display<00:05:29.940> whereas<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.020> hermes<00:05:31.380> kind<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.740> seems

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
display whereas the hermes kind of seems

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.700 
display whereas the hermes kind of seems
like<00:05:32.190> he<00:05:32.370> doesn't<00:05:32.460> fit<00:05:32.789> in<00:05:32.940> by<00:05:33.090> himself

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
like he doesn't fit in by himself

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.430 
like he doesn't fit in by himself
they're<00:05:34.710> misfits<00:05:35.159> man<00:05:35.340> they<00:05:35.460> don't<00:05:35.610> fit<00:05:35.760> in

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
they're misfits man they don't fit in

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.839 
they're misfits man they don't fit in
but<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.500> do<00:05:37.590> like<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:37.949> route<00:05:38.190> off<00:05:38.310> quite<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.580> bit

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
but I do like this route off quite a bit

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.409 
but I do like this route off quite a bit
