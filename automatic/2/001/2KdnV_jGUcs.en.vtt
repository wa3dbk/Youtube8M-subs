the the chainsaw and I took the tree out
that<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.600> crowding<00:01:13.050> it<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.700> took<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:15.030> the

the<00:01:18.180> tree<00:01:18.390> has<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.130> getting<00:01:20.460> shaded

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the tree has is not getting shaded

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.590 
the tree has is not getting shaded
because<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.330> cedar<00:01:21.720> tree<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.740> growing<00:01:23.009> up

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
because the cedar tree was growing up

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.730 
because the cedar tree was growing up
inside<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> apple<00:01:25.050> tree<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.440> can<00:01:25.560> see
