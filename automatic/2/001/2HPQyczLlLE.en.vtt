00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.859
 our house welcome to another forum is 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.300
 true that the htc watch bucks is a 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.339
 terminal that I've been on for a long time 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.139
 the market however as you know no 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.730
 we have been able to analyze it to date 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.530
 in an antro fault and we have not wanted 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.810
 pass up the opportunity to get closer 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.180
 to the hp stand to be able to test the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.720
 tablet from the Taiwanese manufacturer so 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.720
 let's see 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 let's start with the physical aspect 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.789
 of this show led giant goal maker 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.960
 Taiwanese htc the htc and quad maxi is 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.059
 true that takes your time in the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.160
 market but we did not want to miss the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.780
 good occasion little to say in mind 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.180
 the physical aspect we all know what 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.449
 are the benefits of the htc terminal is 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.190
 totally inspired by the htc one is a 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.430
 Vitaminized walsh agent is brought to the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.989
 extreme front sensor sensors 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.510
 exterior front 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.519
 htc bounce out the truth that we love 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.839
 this location of the speakers all a 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.460
 I always hit teams that are 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.900
 pointing towards us is a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.339
 great news 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.739
 besides this we find a 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.750
 front camera buttons in this case 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.150
 the stand is integrated directly 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.009
 of the device behind 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.979
 in this case the manufacturer's logo 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.170
 is lodged in the central part let's go 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.909
 to go to a side and let's see what 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.460
 offers us on the one hand we have the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.740
 unlock button a button to upload and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.509
 Volume down a chrome finish on this 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.430
 case as in laxe de guaminí we 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.170
 we found that it is coated with a 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.610
 plastic finish the truth that pretty 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.040
 very nice very 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.810
 exact but it's true something is subtracted 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 of finishing awards on the other side 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.060
 we only have a small sample 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.250
 that if we lower it and we can remove the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.140
 back cover in this case we remember that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.550
 this lid so it's removable and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.490
 we come to the aspects really 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.930
 important htc equal max as are 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.760
 the finished construction materials 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 metallic the truth that we love 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.200
 next very well at hand camera 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.150
 push-ups of which we will talk about 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 and one of the most interesting things that 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.560
 has this device is that we have a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.210
 fingerprint reader which 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.890
 will unlock the terminal and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.840
 also to activate the series of 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.430
 applications we are going to pass a section 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.320
 very important as is the hardware 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.420
 let's talk a little about the processor 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.180
 in this case it incorporates a qualcomm 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.370
 snapdragon 600 is a quad core that runs 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.830
 to 1.7 gigahertz in addition to this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.290
 we have 2 gigas of ram and for the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.739
 storage we will have two 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.030
 options with a part of 16 or 32 gb a 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.830
 Interesting ep is also that we are going to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.770
 be able to expand this storage 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
 using microsd connectivity cards 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.800
 the truth that does not lack anything either 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.970
 we have gp 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.610
 We have tarpaulins we have nfc bluetooth 4.0 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.920
 dlna and there is a very important detail that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.200
 every time it becomes more important is that 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.020
 This device is compatible with networks 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.090
 4g lte a very interesting detail that does not 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.950
 we can overlook in this 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.350
 case the htc equal max incorporates a 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.050
 pretty generous battery specifically 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.520
 of 3300 thousand but we will pass a 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.110
 outstanding aspect whenever we speak 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.330
 to determine them etc will always be the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.270
 sense word in this case could not be 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.700
 otherwise we have the 65.5 version 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.710
 and as always you know we all have 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.530
 the desks how is a page do 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.450
 horizontal and if we move we find 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.370
 links and one of the novelties in which 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 we will be able to agglutinate all our 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.410
 sentences all our social networks 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.970
 with this careful and beautiful design 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.620
 in the very intuitive way we will be able to 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.120
 as you can see the facebook application in 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.740
 this case logically is not 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.020
 configured but good for you 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.550
 get an idea of ​​the displacement as 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.920
 you all know from here we will be able to 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.150
 configure some parameters like that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.040
 we want you to influence 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.650
 if we want the calendar we want the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.060
 gallery also in this section from 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.400
 here we are going to go to the mobile apps 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.500
 in this case here we are all 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 the available applications that already 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.730
 they come preloaded in the terminal as 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.530
 for example the version of the cart 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.840
 version a flashlight demonstration and 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.090
 different applications that all already 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.040
 you know let's move to the screen 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.200
 main to the desks we are going to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.209
 perform a long press from the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.239
 which are we going to show you how we can 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.519
 create new new desktops for 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.319
 be able to include applications and how to 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.959
 this vertical displacement we are going to 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.810
 to be able to visualize all the widgets that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.510
 we have available for our htc and 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.090
 one man from here beginning with big 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.560
 think of we loved the possibility 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 of one of the updates and that is 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.030
 We could choose if to integrate it 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.979
 directly on a desk this had 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.780
 quite controversy in this case had 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.330
 a success on the part of htc power 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.560
 remove let's make use of the button 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.930
 of holmes to return to the screen 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.660
 main but if we do double 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.520
 pulsation we activate the multitasking a 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.199
 very simple way as you see 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.330
 to be able to discard the 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.970
 applications that we have in second 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 flat without any problem if there 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.599
 an aspect for which the geste stands out 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.699
 of one max in all for its screen in 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.620
 this case of a super lcd technology 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.419
 stress the truth that this technology that 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
 it is not usually used too much but 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.599
 from here in other forums the truth that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.280
 we love let's talk a little about 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.490
 size first we have a panel 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.280
 really big 5.9 inches is all 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.199
 fables there can be no doubt about the 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.270
 the resolution is also very important 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:13.750
 we find resolution hd is 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.449
 Specifically 1080 per thousand 900 pixels 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.130
 the truth that one of the solutions is 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.870
 true that this mobile world congress does not 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.889
 we are finding resolutions 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.930
 4k 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.849
 so we found it at the top of that 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.069
 paragraph important aspect as is the 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.330
 of the density of pixels per inch in 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:33.789
 this case we will have 373 the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.050
 it's not bad at all 373 you have to 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.030
 keep in mind that it is a very screen 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.039
 but that very large and in the section of 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.710
 protection a standard within the 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.880
 standards such as version 3 of 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.170
 gorilla glass 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.150
 well let's talk a little bit about the 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.310
 front camera in this case of htc 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.850
 what max we find with a camera 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.080
 of 2 megapixels let's switch to the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.210
 back which is the truly 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.920
 important good we have not left that 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.560
 the front camera also has a 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.880
 sensor bs and to try to improve the 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.530
 quality of it and be able to capture 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.510
 a lot more light but good said this 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.340
 we go to the back that is the important 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.110
 in this case we find a 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.570
 4 megapixel camera with the 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.370
 ultra pixel technology as you all know 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.100
 this is the technology that has already introduced 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.800
 htc the htc one few megapixels but 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.090
 with a much bigger sensor and the 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.100
 true that this was achieved 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.440
 images that in low light conditions 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.350
 the truth that I was getting quite breast in 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.390
 this case we have the htc and mike witt 2 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.520
 which is the image processing which 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.260
 it allows us to make some captures 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.180
 practically instantaneous as you can 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.920
 appreciate how it was removed from settings 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.200
 because there are some important details 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.240
 and that you must know on the one hand h 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.400
 sector we already know everyone is a 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.990
 software applied by htc which 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.060
 allows our images to charge 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.889
 life was good seconds before 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.360
 seconds 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.090
 and then we can make the curious 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.389
 new assemblies logically modes not that 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.189
 panoramic hdr mode and for being where 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.259
 it's interesting what we found in the 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.150
 dual camera a functionality that we 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.340
 we find in a lot of devices 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.319
 in which, as you can see, the 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.240
 front camera and in turn what 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.159
 We are registering with the back 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.229
 Well this has been reviewing that 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.550
 we have given the chet in guaymas already 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:13.469
 we try to indicate that we are going to do what 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.479
 possible to get it and make it a
