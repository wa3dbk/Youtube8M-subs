00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.510
 here we are hello to everyone and welcome to this 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.310
 new video review today in this 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.990
 new video we're going to talk to you about a 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.290
 new master cooler product ie 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.810
 the 6 woman 120 m we are talking about 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.500
 obviously a dissipator only one al 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.410
 liquid for processors of course 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.020
 to cool as many of you well 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.489
 will be more than everything and we do in 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 see the package as you can see 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.010
 very beautiful aesthetically with colors 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.739
 purple and black with these areas we say 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.840
 very very translucent in this area 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.780
 instead we have only the inscription again 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 here we have some small features in 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 multilingual with images while 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.399
 this area we have the characteristics 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.350
 techniques of this sink that will go 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.539
 to support it can be mounted on i 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.710
 complete intel sockets 2011 1300 66 56 50 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.940
 57 75 and the whole amd fm1 series to put 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.800
 more am3 am2 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.500
 we will have to see even if it will be later 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.050
 possible to mount it on the m2 and in the case 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.630
 there was the possibility we go to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.459
 open it then very well ordered the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.649
 pack as always to accommodate 

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.789
 all the components 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.250
 then first of all we have this 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.910
 small small user gartner is a way 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.940
 of saying 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:42.649
 we have a pretty big figure 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:45.200
 in assembly and this is the guarantee that 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.759
 we don't need it anyway when 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 let's take the little protection instead 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.380
 constructs tools for mounting the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:58.070
 heatsink on our secure socket e 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.650
 here we first have the fan then 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 okay between course is the classic of 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.510
 master cooler and of course there 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.490
 it would be missing from montano to them 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.259
 bundle then you can see the brand 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.810
 with the master quests having the fan 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.080
 sorry for the feature is a lot 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.970
 good according to us that first of all pvm 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 then to the integrated control of the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.680
 fan speed and also has a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 flow rate of about 86 cfm that later 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.110
 we will see if they are obviously 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.150
 royalty 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.459
 this is certainly excellent given that it will have to 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.020
 go and cool the liquid 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:37.060
 heat sink cooler is definitely it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.360
 very good from the side we say of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.280
 transportability 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.900
 consequently it will expel 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.270
 completely all the hot air of the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.530
 heatsink and will go to cool by 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.590
 consequently the liquid to make it come back 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 in a circle and that will go again 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.340
 obviously on the on the basis of the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.019
 water we go to take the part 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.500
 certainly central most important 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:05.299
 we owe this which is not needed then 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.070
 we talk very quickly about these two 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.600
 things then the radiator 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.330
 obviously all in aluminum like 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.880
 always with these little wings or that 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.380
 will go to collect all the heat e 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 later through the mail fan 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.640
 later it will eject the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.340
 heat to cool the water after that 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.190
 will be back in circulation from here after we have 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.799
 these two tubes that have the task of 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.810
 carry coolant and yes 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.660
 connect with the water block 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.130
 the good thing is that these tubes 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.120
 so they are enough folds hours 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.330
 we have the possibility of 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.250
 we say to install them easily 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.690
 in any part of our country 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.150
 always remember, however, that they must 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.769
 be an expulsion for a matter of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.230
 aesthetic with the master did this 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.790
 but a value because 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.790
 cooling down 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.500
 we obviously have the three-way controller 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.299
 pm which is what will obviously handle 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.989
 the water block while we have the base here 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.420
 it is completely copper and not pata 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.430
 mirror however that surely will have the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.129
 its qualities in terms of cooling 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.660
 after of course we will go and see and there 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.030
 we will actually realize how yes 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.669
 involves now we will go to mount e 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.060
 we will see all the various aspects concerning 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.070
 heads and various functions 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.350
 we finally assembled ours 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.160
 heat sink directly on the bench of 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.350
 work 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.539
 as you can see it is complete 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.300
 running right now is first 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.760
 the thing about it is the simplicity of 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.169
 installation now as in the turn 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.930
 of ten minutes cipe we could 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.280
 install it even if we had to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.289
 put the pasta directly on us 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.169
 Thermal as the remaining ones not 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.020
 prepares already provided first applied 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.530
 directly on the sink but provides 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.139
 the classic syringe regarding 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.710
 we use a status LED 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.930
 directly above the water block also 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.479
 if it is a matter of aesthetics only we say 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.340
 and there are no buttons above 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.570
 it and you can see that the fan is 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.150
 completely running and it's a lot 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.340
 silent even if we have to try it ad 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.010
 further regimes to see how it is 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.870
 involves in modality factor e 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.670
 let's call the curve I try to see the 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.030
 maximum of 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.320
 let's move or see the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.120
 temperatures 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.540
 then you can see that we have the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.220
 processor 4 gb 2 as usual, and also 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.630
 if at this time in idle with 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.020
 temperatures are around 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:40.190
 32 34 degrees which are certainly excellent 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.420
 with regards to and temperatures in one 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.520
 method precisely when we are not 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.770
 using the computer excessively 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.860
 let's go to a header and fast 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.900
 to see how it behaves 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.590
 then you can notice the frequency it has 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:59.750
 resumed its full 4 GB speed 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.400
 now obviously you also have to tend 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.920
 a few minutes is certainly the case 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.890
 test that should be done for half an hour 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.550
 or an hour even two hours and if you want though 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.650
 wanting to take a first look you can 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.840
 note that it still holds up very well of 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.950
 value you don't have the first choir has 49 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.960
 years 53 according to 47 to the third 52 the picture 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.780
 so anyway they are very good like 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.130
 values that surely and will allow 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.810
 to push our own further 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.270
 overclock processor 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.670
 in the case the maximum the possibility said 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.480
 we therefore want to thank 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.190
 master cooler because he gave us 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.260
 the opportunity to be able to test this 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.180
 great heat sink is also up to you for 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.730
 have it for viewing this video 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.100
 review please subscribe to

 our channel to see others 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.020
 our reviews our other tests e 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.280
 unboxing and so we can also follow 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.720
 on our site 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.440
 hello everyone and then the next 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.440
 video review
