00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
want to block you want the bind off edge
to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.149> really<00:00:27.479> stretchy<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:28.319> can<00:00:28.499> pin<00:00:28.679> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
to be really stretchy so you can pin it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.800 
to be really stretchy so you can pin it
out<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> bind<00:00:31.949> off<00:00:32.450> so<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> shouldn't

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
out and the bind off so that shouldn't

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.420 
out and the bind off so that shouldn't
you<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.290> doesn't<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.580> work<00:00:35.910> well

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
you before doesn't really work well

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.200 
you before doesn't really work well
before<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.580> because<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:38.940> end<00:00:39.120> up

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
before that because that can end up

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
before that because that can end up
being<00:00:39.450> pretty<00:00:39.660> tight<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.220> start<00:00:41.610> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
being pretty tight and so to start this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
being pretty tight and so to start this
bind<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.830> first<00:00:44.160> knit<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:45.000> stitch<00:00:46.550> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bind off you first knit one stitch like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.780 
bind off you first knit one stitch like
normal<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.470> then<00:00:49.470> you<00:00:49.710> knit<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.100> second<00:00:50.550> stitch

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
normal and then you knit a second stitch

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.790 
normal and then you knit a second stitch
so<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:51.450> you<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.630> two<00:00:51.990> stitches<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.710> your

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so then you have two stitches on your

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970 
so then you have two stitches on your
right<00:00:53.130> hand<00:00:53.340> needle<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.750> insert<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.620> left

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
right hand needle you insert your left

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
right hand needle you insert your left
needle<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> front<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.810> these<00:00:58.020> two

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
needle into the front of these two

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430 
needle into the front of these two
stitches<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.450> on<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:01.200> right<00:01:01.350> hand

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
stitches and then on the right hand

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.149 
stitches and then on the right hand
needle<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.040> wrap<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.550> yarn<00:01:02.579> around<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.540> pull

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
needle you wrap the yarn around and pull

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.830 
needle you wrap the yarn around and pull
through<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.399> pull<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.969> needle<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
through and pull off the needle so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.980 
through and pull off the needle so
you're<00:01:07.469> essentially<00:01:08.719> knitting<00:01:09.719> one<00:01:09.960> stitch

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you're essentially knitting one stitch

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.770 
you're essentially knitting one stitch
and<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.759> you're<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.240> knitting<00:01:12.509> these

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and then you're gonna be knitting these

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380 
and then you're gonna be knitting these
two<00:01:13.079> stitches<00:01:13.289> together<00:01:13.619> by<00:01:14.490> inserting<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
two stitches together by inserting the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.379 
two stitches together by inserting the
needle<00:01:15.780> into<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:16.020> front<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.679> stitches

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:17.389 
needle into the front of the stitches

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.629 
needle into the front of the stitches
wrapping<00:01:18.389> the<00:01:18.600> yarn<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.829> right<00:01:20.399> hand

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
wrapping the yarn around the right hand

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.660 
wrapping the yarn around the right hand
needle<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.270> pulling<00:01:22.170> through<00:01:22.649> so<00:01:23.520> you're

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
needle and pulling through so you're

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.459 
needle and pulling through so you're
kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.999> knitting<00:01:24.389> two<00:01:24.659> together<00:01:24.840> through

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
kind of knitting two together through

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.340 
kind of knitting two together through
the<00:01:25.619> through<00:01:26.609> the<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:26.909> loop<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.139> doing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the through the back loop but just doing

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
the through the back loop but just doing
it<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:29.069> right<00:01:29.189> hand<00:01:29.369> needle<00:01:29.549> instead<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
it on your right hand needle instead of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.989 
it on your right hand needle instead of
the<00:01:30.149> left<00:01:30.329> hand<00:01:30.569> needle<00:01:31.819> so<00:01:32.819> we<00:01:32.999> knit<00:01:33.209> one

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
the left hand needle so we knit one

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.029 
the left hand needle so we knit one
insert<00:01:35.999> the<00:01:36.659> left<00:01:36.869> hand<00:01:37.079> needle<00:01:37.439> through<00:01:37.770> both

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
insert the left hand needle through both

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.480 
insert the left hand needle through both
of<00:01:38.249> the<00:01:38.340> stitches<00:01:39.139> wrap<00:01:40.139> the<00:01:40.499> yarn<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
of the stitches wrap the yarn around the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
of the stitches wrap the yarn around the
right<00:01:41.639> hand<00:01:41.880> needle<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.109> pull<00:01:43.439> through<00:01:45.590> knit

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
right hand needle and pull through knit

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.069 
right hand needle and pull through knit
one<00:01:46.859> stitch<00:01:51.709> and<00:01:52.709> so<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> rhythm<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:54.079> can

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
one stitch and so the rhythm of this can

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
one stitch and so the rhythm of this can
you<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.529> actually<00:01:55.859> start<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.450> pretty

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
you can actually start going pretty

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.769 
you can actually start going pretty
quickly<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:59.249> rhythm<00:01:59.579> isn't<00:01:59.819> so<00:02:00.270> bad<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.599> all

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:00.779 
quickly the rhythm isn't so bad at all

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.260 
quickly the rhythm isn't so bad at all
and<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.979> I've<00:02:02.249> shown<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.849> know<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and as I've shown you know this is a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
and as I've shown you know this is a
very<00:02:03.749> nice<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.289> stretchy<00:02:04.560> bind-off<00:02:05.009> because

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
very nice and stretchy bind-off because

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.410 
very nice and stretchy bind-off because
you<00:02:06.599> aren't<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.740> guess<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.759> edge<00:02:09.030> isn't

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you aren't just I guess this edge isn't

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
you aren't just I guess this edge isn't
really<00:02:09.600> composed<00:02:09.900> of<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.410> single<00:02:10.619> stitch

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
really composed of just a single stitch

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550 
really composed of just a single stitch
over<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.700> there's<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> yarn<00:02:12.540> from<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
over and over there's the yarn from the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.290 
over and over there's the yarn from the
knit<00:02:13.860> stitch

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
knit stitch

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.240 
knit stitch
before<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.810> do<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> k2tog<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.670> helpful

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
before you do the k2tog that is helpful

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.150 
before you do the k2tog that is helpful
so<00:02:19.250> knit<00:02:19.610> one<00:02:20.320> stick<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.440> left<00:02:21.620> hand<00:02:21.830> kneel<00:02:21.980> on
