 hey for you we are marking you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.420
 rock and that is a comeback of some 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.790
 way of your husband rob schneider to the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 small screen in a project that the 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.610
 truth has taken all the affection all 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 the effort and all the work how it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.420
 already feel with this first sample of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.510
 real rock that is there in the networks 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 social 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:13.049
 and that we already saw of course this first 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 taste as you say and it is very very 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.360
 fun what we are seeing in the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.130
 screen 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 we know they were filming in the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.729
 angels in Orlando and that also 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 well of course it has a touch 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.399
 very mexican this series for someone 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.280
 well, we really found a lot 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.750
 in the life of rum and port the folklore 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 which includes having a Mexican wife and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.039
 what does it mean for you to see tell us 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.690
 what it's like to be short for you how it is 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.390
 be married to a movie star 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.340
 like as schneider rob and on the side of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.490
 rock like being married to a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.020
 Mexican as proactive as moved 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.340
 you and do at least for me and I think that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.770
 as I had already mentioned in a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.159
 previous interview 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.710
 it's an experience 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.649
 incredible in far away lack of photos and the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.100
 truth is that there was not very much 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:10.119
 then and is like father the toiletry bag 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.150
 with the movie star but 2000 photos 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.730
 of the steed's father and how it does not 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.459
 suppress for me hey but tell us a 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.980
 little bit of how is your life now like 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.790

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:32.970
 movie star married to a Mexican 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:36.190
 good the Mexican always two sides 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.120
 understood that the only thing that has to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.610
 to do is to say you have it already very 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.680
 trained then which is fine 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.620

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.760
 he wants to talk is not that to begin with 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.930
 must develop a tolerance to eat 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.110
 spicy things like red has 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.790

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.970
 super rich guacamole or can no longer 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.480
 eat chicken soup if you do not have chili 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.480
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:29.560
 as normal as any couple 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:32.380
 in our moments that is quite 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.300
 normal already we talked a little yes we 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.280
 you can advance what are the plans 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.650
 I know you are producers 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.209
 executives of the series series b les 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.800
 belongs to you and what is the 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.209
 next step are already excess 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.959
 working on the edition in the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.730
 post-production 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.019
 but a beast with this assembly that 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.880
 they have and the videos that we're already 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.310
 showing what the next step will be 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.560
 to sell the series and good to see it 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.110
 in several countries of the world good in 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.920
 these moments we are having several 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.200
 together with some with some channels 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.450
 who are interested in partnering with 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.910
 us how to discriminate is also 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.120
 injury then we still do not have 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.790
 we still do not have the house for the round 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.910
 but we are in talks and probably 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.829
 next week we already have the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.519
 and the beginning will remain and where the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.350
 mental 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.290
 hey let's talk to the people of 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.240
 chain 3 in the sister channel of 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.330
 ExcÃ©lsior TV so that you also come to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 talk and in one of those we see the show 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.710
 in Mexico through this clear signal 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.710
 that would be a great idea 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.060
 ask about something there 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.310
 there are three Mexicans in key positions in 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.440
 this production starting with you 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.150
 continuing for moral angels and good 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.340
 following the film photographer carlos 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.160
 hidalgo this in what way was impregnated 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.290
 the series that we will see that is manuel rock 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.070
 you can say that it impregnates a lot 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.830
 heart to the series he was always 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.210
 written with a lot of love with a lot of love 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.950
 It is very personal 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.780
 many of the all that are in the 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.910
 series because obviously they are things that we 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.550
 have happened in life really is a 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.730
 exaggerated version of our lives but 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.230
 I think that having Mexicans 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.200
 working 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.170
 like they put us a little bit more 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.810
 taste up the series and well obviously 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.660
 he has a cinematographer 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.540
 well with his Mexican eye of Latin and 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.360
 heart there to skin flower or be it 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:37.420
 I add all the necessary touches to 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.520
 that would be appreciated in a fantasy and 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.780

 Pending everything that happens with this 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.060
