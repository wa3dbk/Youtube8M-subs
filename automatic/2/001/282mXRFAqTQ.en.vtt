from over here alright so a little bit

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.760 
from over here alright so a little bit
closer<00:01:56.439> still<00:01:57.439> not<00:01:57.649> bad<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.899> little<00:01:59.899> bit<00:02:00.020> closer

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
closer still not bad a little bit closer

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.480 
closer still not bad a little bit closer
once<00:02:01.700> again<00:02:01.880> heal<00:02:02.270> yourself<00:02:05.950> okay<00:02:06.950> let's<00:02:07.220> wait

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.699 

yeah<00:02:16.190> still<00:02:16.549> quite<00:02:16.849> some<00:02:17.120> damage<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:18.590> only

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
yeah still quite some damage the only

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.520 
yeah still quite some damage the only
problem<00:02:19.459> is<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.480> slow<00:02:20.840> weapon

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
problem is that it's a slow weapon

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.280 
problem is that it's a slow weapon
yeah<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.549> will<00:02:22.790> cancel<00:02:23.209> up<00:02:23.569> most<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
yeah so that will cancel up most of the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.080 
yeah so that will cancel up most of the
high<00:02:24.440> damage<00:02:24.799> it's<00:02:25.190> getting<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.459> yeah<00:02:28.700> if<00:02:28.909> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
high damage it's getting so yeah if you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.430 
high damage it's getting so yeah if you
get<00:02:29.299> too<00:02:29.510> close<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.260> damage<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.480> depletes

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.039 

so<00:02:39.440> yeah<00:02:39.709> basically<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> long<00:02:41.450> slash

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
so yeah basically this is a long slash

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.490 
so yeah basically this is a long slash
moderate<00:02:43.010> weapon<00:02:43.489> it's<00:02:44.090> slow<00:02:44.690> I've<00:02:45.170> been

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
moderate weapon it's slow I've been

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.190 
moderate weapon it's slow I've been
comparing<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.099> other<00:02:49.220> long

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
comparing it to the to the other long

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.729 
comparing it to the to the other long
machine<00:02:51.200> gun<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:52.819> seems<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.989> little<00:02:54.379> bit

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
machine gun it seems to be a little bit

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.020 
machine gun it seems to be a little bit
slower<00:02:55.930> however<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.040> actually<00:02:58.519> does<00:02:58.790> a

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
slower however and it it actually does a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.899 
slower however and it it actually does a
little<00:02:59.660> bit<00:02:59.870> less<00:03:00.109> damage<00:03:00.590> it's<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:01.790> a

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
little bit less damage it's it's a

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.569 
little bit less damage it's it's a
little<00:03:02.030> bit<00:03:02.180> more<00:03:02.629> random<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:04.159> see<00:03:04.370> for

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
little bit more random you see for

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.699 
little bit more random you see for
example<00:03:04.609> you<00:03:05.000> take<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.269> normal<00:03:05.690> gun<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.560> of

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
example you take a normal gun one of

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.050 
example you take a normal gun one of
those<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.459> know<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:09.069> say<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.609> 249<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
those you know just say this in 249 and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.899 
those you know just say this in 249 and
it<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.359> goes<00:03:15.019> around<00:03:15.349> a<00:03:15.769> certain<00:03:16.129> value<00:03:16.489> it

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
it just goes around a certain value it

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.650 
it just goes around a certain value it
doesn't<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.900> doesn't<00:03:18.819> have<00:03:19.819> many

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
doesn't you know doesn't have many

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.250 
doesn't you know doesn't have many
values<00:03:21.290> outside<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.480> limited<00:03:23.480> range<00:03:23.780> while

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
values outside of a limited range while

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.860 
values outside of a limited range while
this<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:25.400> kind<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.819> its<00:03:26.630> kind<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.049> more<00:03:27.380> random

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
this it kind of its kind of more random

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.900 
this it kind of its kind of more random
however<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.019> has<00:03:30.230> more<00:03:30.590> accuracy<00:03:31.160> than<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
however it has more accuracy than the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.409 
however it has more accuracy than the
the<00:03:32.299> m249<00:03:32.959> or<00:03:33.379> any<00:03:34.030> normal<00:03:37.419> long-range

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
the m249 or any normal long-range

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.470 
the m249 or any normal long-range
machine<00:03:38.930> guns

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
machine guns

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.720 
machine guns
however<00:03:41.480> yeah<00:03:42.049> it's<00:03:42.379> it<00:03:42.709> will<00:03:42.859> probably<00:03:43.190> end

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
however yeah it's it will probably end

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.839 
however yeah it's it will probably end
up<00:03:44.209> with<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:45.069> lower<00:03:46.599> damage<00:03:47.599> output<00:03:48.079> since<00:03:48.849> you

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
up with a lower damage output since you

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.930 
up with a lower damage output since you
know<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.329> actually<00:03:50.900> deals<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.919> little<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.400> less

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
know it actually deals a little bit less

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.659 
know it actually deals a little bit less
damage<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.810> it's<00:03:54.470> slower<00:03:55.010> than<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:56.690> normal

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
damage and it's slower than the normal

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.390 
damage and it's slower than the normal
normal<00:03:58.669> long<00:03:59.060> range<00:03:59.389> machine<00:03:59.989> guns<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.220> yeah

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
normal long range machine guns so yeah

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.909 
normal long range machine guns so yeah
basically<00:04:01.639> that's<00:04:02.239> it<00:04:02.569> for<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.470> underworld

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
basically that's it for the underworld

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.509
