pointed precisely in the direction of
the<00:01:17.790> satellite<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> need<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> good<00:01:18.960> view

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the satellite so you need a good view

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.450 
the satellite so you need a good view
south<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:19.950> somebody<00:01:20.220> else<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
south if you get somebody else to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
south if you get somebody else to
install<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> cost<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:21.990> 60

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
install it for you the cost about 60

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.600 
install it for you the cost about 60
pounds<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.189> so

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
well that fingers crossed we should get

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.320 
well that fingers crossed we should get
those<00:01:25.170> first<00:01:25.530> pictures<00:01:25.770> coming<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.210> we

are and those first pictures of the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.770 
are and those first pictures of the
control<00:01:29.400> room<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> astra<00:01:30.060> headquarters<00:01:30.600> in

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
control room of astra headquarters in

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.280 
control room of astra headquarters in
Luxembourg<00:01:31.970> now<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.390> course<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:34.170> any

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Luxembourg now of course if there's any

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.899 
Luxembourg now of course if there's any
obstructions<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.100> trees<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.700> buildings

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
obstructions like trees or buildings

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.630 
obstructions like trees or buildings
then<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.659> lose<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.380> signal<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> if

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
then you will lose that signal and if

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
then you will lose that signal and if
you<00:01:38.759> live<00:01:38.970> north<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.570> Manchester<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you live north of Manchester then the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
you live north of Manchester then the
signal<00:01:40.770> gets<00:01:40.950> weak<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.579> you'll<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
signal gets weak there so you'll have to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
signal gets weak there so you'll have to
buy<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.390> larger<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:43.079> expensive<00:01:43.200> dish<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.750> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
buy a larger more expensive dish and the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
buy a larger more expensive dish and the
picture<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> television<00:01:46.770> set<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> their

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
picture on that television set is their

initially<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.110> Astra<00:02:37.680> channels<00:02:38.010> will<00:02:38.160> be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
initially the Astra channels will be

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100 
initially the Astra channels will be
free<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.850> soon<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.630> will<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.020> on

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
free but soon some will be on

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.229 
free but soon some will be on
subscription<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.489> means<00:02:41.760> buying<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
subscription and that means buying a

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.420 
subscription and that means buying a
decoder<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.930> unscramble<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> signal<00:02:44.040> as<00:02:44.220> well

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
decoder to unscramble the signal as well

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
decoder to unscramble the signal as well
as<00:02:44.580> paying<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.940> subscription<00:02:45.420> itself<00:02:45.780> right

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
as paying the subscription itself right

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520 
as paying the subscription itself right
so<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.880> about<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.390> BSB<00:02:48.750> system

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so what about the BSB system

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.030 
so what about the BSB system
well<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.430> costs<00:02:50.880> around<00:02:51.140> 250<00:02:52.140> pounds<00:02:52.560> but

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
well this costs around 250 pounds but

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.580 
well this costs around 250 pounds but
instead<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:54.090> dish<00:02:54.420> there's<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.050> small

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
instead of a dish there's a small

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.680 
instead of a dish there's a small
antenna<00:02:56.370> which<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.060> course<00:02:57.090> will<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.570> be

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
antenna which of course will have to be

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.960 
antenna which of course will have to be
pointed<00:02:58.019> at<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> BSB<00:02:58.560> satellite<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.519> this

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
pointed at the BSB satellite and this

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.720 
pointed at the BSB satellite and this
feeds<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.420> different<00:03:00.870> set<00:03:01.200> top<00:03:01.470> tuner<00:03:02.010> which

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
feeds a different set top tuner which

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.520 
feeds a different set top tuner which
actually<00:03:03.180> incorporates<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.930> subscription

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
actually incorporates a subscription

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.000 
actually incorporates a subscription
decoder<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:06.060> BSB<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.930> taking<00:03:07.290> advantage<00:03:07.410> of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
decoder but BSB is taking advantage of

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.280 
decoder but BSB is taking advantage of
new<00:03:08.250> technology<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.060> using<00:03:09.720> an<00:03:09.840> improved
