00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.520
 5 side posts 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.810
 Two packages of stainless steel tubes 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.810
 diameter 10 millimeters a pack of 5 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.840

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.120
 diameter 10 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 we are going to install a handrail for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
 protect these stairs that give access 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.340
 to a garret in our case we have 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 chosen an aluminum railing and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.840
 stainless steel composed of posts 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.909
 handrails pipes and glass panels 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 acrylic but the merlin leroy can you 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.360
 find several models of handrails 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.580
 clinical tube or cable with 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.600
 Different handrails in different types 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.009
 wooden 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.229
 we started by marking the place where 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 we will place the posts from one end 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.940
 to another of the ladder with a distance 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 of advisable of 1 meter between post and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.399
 post although it will depend on the place of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399
 installation 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.760
 we have to be careful that all 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.860
 the posts are level now we place 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.900
 the tubes and handrails 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 we cut them to the required size to 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 can adjust the angles we slide the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.730
 tube inside the nuts fixing 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.129
 that are on the pole 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.540
 to place the handrail we do it 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.540
 over the heads of the posts 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.330
 we join the tubes and the handrail with 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.840
 joints 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.840
 i 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.470
 We tighten the nuts when all the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.360
 tubes are placed with the possible 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.740
 joints or joints 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.840
 finally we put the kit 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.750
 protection we fix a glass panel 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.040
 acrylic of 1 meter between each 2 posts 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.040
 with the 4 fixings 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.510
 the material of the handrail resists 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.070
 both inside and outside with the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.720
 except that if we want to install it 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.910
 in places near the sea is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.230
 advisable to put the cable range for 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.230
 avoid solid corrosion 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.760
 and up to here our demonstration will 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.800
 We invite you to visit our stores
