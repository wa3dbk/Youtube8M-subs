photography because the rest of its out
of<00:02:35.820> focus<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.440> we've<00:02:37.620> got<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:40.650> I'll

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
of focus and we've got that one now I'll

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.470 
of focus and we've got that one now I'll
right-click<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.310> top<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> layer<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
right-click the top of the layer and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.460 
right-click the top of the layer and
just<00:02:42.900> merge<00:02:43.200> down<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:45.660> brings<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.050> down<00:02:46.230> onto

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
just merge down it brings it down onto

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.210 
just merge down it brings it down onto
the<00:02:46.590> other<00:02:46.770> layer<00:02:47.030> I'll<00:02:48.030> go<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.270> layers<00:02:49.220> mask

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the other layer I'll go to layers mask

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.580 
the other layer I'll go to layers mask
and<00:02:50.670> add<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.450> layer<00:02:51.720> mask<00:02:53.510> white<00:02:54.510> Paula<00:02:55.050> pasady

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
and add a layer mask white Paula pasady

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.449 
and add a layer mask white Paula pasady
once<00:02:55.739> again<00:02:57.110> now<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.320> work<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> bottom<00:02:59.130> half

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
once again now I work on the bottom half

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.380 
once again now I work on the bottom half
now<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.450> where<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:01.820> colors<00:03:02.820> are<00:03:03.030> will<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
now I know where my colors are will the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.720 
now I know where my colors are will the
brush<00:03:03.690> I'll<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.560> bring<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.070> into<00:03:05.340> focus

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
brush I'll just bring it that into focus

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.509 
brush I'll just bring it that into focus
now<00:03:05.940> by<00:03:06.150> using<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.660> mask<00:03:06.900> idea<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:08.280> why

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
now by using that mask idea that's why

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.850 
now by using that mask idea that's why
the<00:03:08.580> lines<00:03:08.910> are<00:03:09.120> there<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:09.870> go<00:03:10.799> too

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the lines are there so you don't go too

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.979 
the lines are there so you don't go too
far<00:03:11.370> into<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> other<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.330> blurred<00:03:12.570> all<00:03:12.810> that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
far into the other and blurred all that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.810 
far into the other and blurred all that
again<00:03:13.260> because<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.980> other<00:03:14.130> parties<00:03:14.610> are

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
again because the other parties are

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.050 
again because the other parties are
still<00:03:14.940> blurred<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.519> bottom<00:03:17.850> half

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
still blurred in the in this bottom half

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300 
still blurred in the in this bottom half
of<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.239> image<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.590> clean<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.010> all

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
of the image you just clean up all

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.850 
of the image you just clean up all
around<00:03:20.610> there<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.230> all<00:03:22.230> around<00:03:22.410> you'll<00:03:22.709> watch

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
around there and all around you'll watch

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.280 
around there and all around you'll watch
down<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> bottom<00:03:23.810> bring<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.930> all<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
down the bottom bring it all in the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.110 
down the bottom bring it all in the
focus<00:03:28.220> now<00:03:29.220> I've<00:03:29.400> been<00:03:29.519> going<00:03:29.730> enlarge<00:03:30.030> my

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
focus now I've been going enlarge my

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
focus now I've been going enlarge my
brush<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.489> brighten<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> felt<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.959> then

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
brush and brighten up the felt and then

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.289 
brush and brighten up the felt and then
you<00:03:34.410> need<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.709> be<00:03:34.799> reasonably<00:03:35.310> careful<00:03:35.519> just

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
you need to be reasonably careful just

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.110 
you need to be reasonably careful just
to<00:03:36.709> because<00:03:37.709> if<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:37.920> go<00:03:38.040> too<00:03:38.340> far<00:03:38.580> up<00:03:38.820> you

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to because if you go too far up you

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840 
to because if you go too far up you
start<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.630> blur<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.739> other<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.220> other<00:03:41.400> image

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
start to blur the other one other image

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.240 
start to blur the other one other image
on<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> top<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.500> we're<00:03:43.650> working<00:03:43.769> we're

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
on the top so we're working we're

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250 
on the top so we're working we're
bringing<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.730> bottom<00:03:45.269> image<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> view<00:03:46.049> by

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
bringing the bottom image in the view by

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.580 
bringing the bottom image in the view by
using<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:46.739> layer<00:03:46.980> mask<00:03:51.110> I'd<00:03:52.110> say<00:03:52.440> that's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
using this layer mask I'd say that's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.220 
using this layer mask I'd say that's
about<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.080> go<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.430> image

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
about it I just go and go to image

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.350 
about it I just go and go to image
guides<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.390> remove<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.630> guides<00:04:02.090> right<00:04:03.090> click

the<00:04:03.480> top<00:04:03.690> layer<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.170> flatten<00:04:04.799> image<00:04:06.079> and

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
the top layer and flatten image and

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.080 
the top layer and flatten image and
there's<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:08.040> tutorials<00:04:08.640> brought<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:09.000> all

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
there's the tutorials brought it all

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.979 
there's the tutorials brought it all
into<00:04:09.150> focus

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
into focus

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.740 
into focus
let's<00:04:10.830> call<00:04:11.130> photo<00:04:11.430> stacking

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
let's call photo stacking

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.120 
let's call photo stacking
and<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.350> used<00:04:13.530> for<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.830> type<00:04:13.890> of

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
and it can be used for this type of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.789 
and it can be used for this type of
thing<00:04:14.640> because<00:04:15.540> when<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> use<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.230> macro<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
thing because when you use the macro you

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.250 
thing because when you use the macro you
get<00:04:16.950> two<00:04:17.160> closing<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:17.970> only<00:04:18.540> part<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.930> its<00:04:19.080> in

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
get two closing and only part of its in

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.949 
get two closing and only part of its in
focus<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:19.920> it<00:04:20.640> can<00:04:20.790> be<00:04:20.910> used<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.299> flowers<00:04:21.780> you

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
focus so it can be used in flowers you

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.600 
focus so it can be used in flowers you
can<00:04:22.110> use<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.530> on<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> diamond<00:04:23.160> ring<00:04:23.310> where<00:04:23.550> you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
can use it on a diamond ring where you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.190 
can use it on a diamond ring where you
want<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:23.880> whole<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.390> ring<00:04:24.570> shown<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
want the whole of the ring shown and

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.380 
want the whole of the ring shown and
there's<00:04:26.190> quite<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> few<00:04:26.520> things<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:27.210> use

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
there's quite a few things you can use

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.420 
there's quite a few things you can use
it<00:04:27.540> on<00:04:27.630> because<00:04:28.230> normally<00:04:28.620> when<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:28.950> take<00:04:29.400> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
it on because normally when you take a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.890 
it on because normally when you take a
photo<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:29.910> want<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.300> background<00:04:30.720> out<00:04:30.870> of

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
photo you want the background out of

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.720 
photo you want the background out of
focus<00:04:31.020> that's<00:04:31.560> usually<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:31.920> portrait<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:32.610> it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
focus that's usually a portrait so it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.660 
focus that's usually a portrait so it
really<00:04:33.240> jumps<00:04:33.570> out<00:04:33.690> at<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:34.370> thank<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.490> for
