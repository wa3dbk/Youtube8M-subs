00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
what you really have to watch out for is

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.770 
what you really have to watch out for is
that<00:02:58.000> they<00:02:58.150> don't<00:02:58.360> get<00:02:58.480> scratched<00:03:00.600> but<00:03:01.600> you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
that they don't get scratched but you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
that they don't get scratched but you
know<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.170> inevitable<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> do<00:03:03.520> think<00:03:03.880> they

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
know it's inevitable but I do think they

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.050 
know it's inevitable but I do think they
hold<00:03:04.300> up<00:03:04.660> pretty<00:03:05.080> well<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.770> little<00:03:06.610> scratching

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
with this bag I do keep her stuffed but

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.750 
with this bag I do keep her stuffed but
that<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.130> something<00:04:06.489> I<00:04:06.760> started<00:04:07.270> recently<00:04:08.760> so

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that is something I started recently so

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.180 
that is something I started recently so
she<00:04:09.820> does<00:04:10.209> fall<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> little<00:04:10.989> here<00:04:11.680> on<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.920> side

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
she does fall a little here on the side

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.490 
she does fall a little here on the side
so<00:04:12.220> don't<00:04:12.519> know<00:04:12.820> if<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.060> yeah<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:14.080> can<00:04:14.260> see

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
so don't know if you yeah you can see

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.539 
so don't know if you yeah you can see
this<00:04:14.709> here<00:04:15.070> she<00:04:15.700> does<00:04:15.970> do<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.690> at<00:04:17.290> both<00:04:17.919> sides

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
this here she does do this at both sides

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.610 
this here she does do this at both sides
and<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.299> think<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:19.660> because<00:04:19.989> she's<00:04:20.200> heavier

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
and I think it's because she's heavier

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.750 
and I think it's because she's heavier
at<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.980> top<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.350> do<00:04:23.650> keep<00:04:23.950> her<00:04:24.160> stuff<00:04:24.430> now

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
at the top so I do keep her stuff now

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.710 
at the top so I do keep her stuff now
and<00:04:24.789> I<00:04:25.120> can<00:04:25.330> see<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.900> helps

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
and I can see that it helps

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.570 
and I can see that it helps
it<00:04:27.720> has<00:04:27.870> already<00:04:28.080> helped<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.949> that<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.250> really

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
it has already helped so that is really

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.100 
it has already helped so that is really
really<00:04:29.759> nice

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.100
