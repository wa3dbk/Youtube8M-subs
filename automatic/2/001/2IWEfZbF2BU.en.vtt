having<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.600> cut<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.110> off<00:03:13.500> right<00:03:14.490> there<00:03:14.850> in

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
having to cut this off right there in

having to cut this off right there in
order<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.350> keep<00:03:16.830> my<00:03:16.890> wheel<00:03:17.190> my

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
order to get so I can keep my wheel my

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.870 
order to get so I can keep my wheel my
tire<00:03:17.700> tucked<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.360> due<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> my<00:03:19.320> stretch

tire tucked in there due to my stretch

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.310 
tire tucked in there due to my stretch
so<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> rear<00:03:21.330> that's<00:03:21.900> what<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.170> looks

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
see I kind of messed up on the cut right

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.880 
see I kind of messed up on the cut right
here<00:03:55.180> since<00:03:55.359> my<00:03:55.540> previous<00:03:56.049> cut<00:03:56.290> fenders<00:03:56.650> must

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
here since my previous cut fenders must

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.580 
here since my previous cut fenders must
have<00:03:57.010> screwed<00:03:57.189> that<00:03:57.310> up<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:58.379> what<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.469> looks

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
have screwed that up but what it looks

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.979 
have screwed that up but what it looks
like<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:01.079> then<00:04:02.079> as<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.409> know<00:04:02.439> I<00:04:02.590> did<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:04.620> video

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
like and then as you know I did a video

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:22.430 
like and then as you know I did a video
here<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:20.500> how<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.680> do<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.099> turn<00:04:21.609> signal<00:04:21.970> mod

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
here on how to do this turn signal mod

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.710 
here on how to do this turn signal mod
so<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.680> way<00:04:23.830> your<00:04:24.070> outer<00:04:24.280> signal<00:04:25.180> blinks

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
so that way your outer signal blinks

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:39.539 
so that way your outer signal blinks
with<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.259> turn<00:04:26.440> signal<00:04:26.770> or<00:04:27.460> your<00:04:27.580> hazards

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
drag link and that's not street-legal

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.339 
drag link and that's not street-legal
so<00:04:58.129> hydro<00:04:58.639> cyst<00:04:58.969> I<00:04:59.239> did<00:04:59.839> the<00:04:59.929> deeper<00:05:00.169> self

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
so hydro cyst I did the deeper self

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.799 
so hydro cyst I did the deeper self
version<00:05:00.939> where<00:05:01.939> you<00:05:02.059> actually<00:05:02.179> attach<00:05:02.389> it

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:02.809 
version where you actually attach it

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:06.099 
version where you actually attach it
just<00:05:02.839> into<00:05:03.319> your<00:05:03.469> gearbox<00:05:04.039> and<00:05:04.929> then<00:05:05.929> run

now<00:05:35.389> this<00:05:35.629> Ram<00:05:35.809> is<00:05:35.959> actually<00:05:36.289> a<00:05:36.319> bigger<00:05:36.829> it's

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
now this Ram is actually a bigger it's

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.309 
now this Ram is actually a bigger it's
too<00:05:37.339> big<00:05:37.489> for<00:05:37.609> a<00:05:37.669> JK<00:05:37.999> I<00:05:38.209> did<00:05:38.869> that<00:05:39.019> since<00:05:39.229> you

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
too big for a JK I did that since you

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.859 
too big for a JK I did that since you
know<00:05:39.349> I'm<00:05:39.499> doing<00:05:39.679> an<00:05:39.739> actual<00:05:39.889> swap<00:05:40.509> and<00:05:41.509> so

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:41.869 
know I'm doing an actual swap and so

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.489

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
weld my rear track bar bracket and you

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.420 
weld my rear track bar bracket and you
can<00:06:35.750> see<00:06:35.870> it's<00:06:35.990> kind<00:06:36.199> of<00:06:36.229> turned<00:06:36.770> right<00:06:37.040> there

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430

so<00:06:38.330> my<00:06:38.449> axles<00:06:38.750> actually<00:06:39.050> shifted<00:06:39.380> over<00:06:39.440> about

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
so my axles actually shifted over about

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.270 
so my axles actually shifted over about
an<00:06:39.889> inch<00:06:40.010> too<00:06:40.220> far<00:06:41.590> and<00:06:42.590> when<00:06:42.740> that<00:06:42.860> happened

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
an inch too far and when that happened

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.920 
an inch too far and when that happened
it<00:06:43.370> used<00:06:43.760> to<00:06:43.880> be<00:06:44.030> about<00:06:44.240> three<00:06:44.510> inches<00:06:44.750> too<00:06:44.900> far

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
it used to be about three inches too far

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.920 
it used to be about three inches too far
to<00:06:45.860> where<00:06:45.919> my<00:06:46.160> drive<00:06:46.910> shaft<00:06:46.940> actually<00:06:47.600> smashed

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
to where my drive shaft actually smashed

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.420 
to where my drive shaft actually smashed
into<00:06:48.139> my<00:06:48.320> guessing<00:06:48.830> skin<00:06:49.510> but<00:06:50.949> I'll<00:06:51.949> Worldnet

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430
