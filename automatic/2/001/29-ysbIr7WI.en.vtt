basically so this you can buy this as a
bigger<00:00:35.700> bone<00:00:36.649> later<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
bigger bone later on when they come to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
three gigahertz and all of that in this

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
three gigahertz and all of that in this
box<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> basically<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.000> packs<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
box that is basically like two packs of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
box that is basically like two packs of
cigarettes<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.310> reason<00:01:26.549> why

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cigarettes or what the reason why

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
cigarettes or what the reason why
they're<00:01:26.790> calling<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.570> chocolate<00:01:27.990> box<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
they're calling it a chocolate box is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
they're calling it a chocolate box is
basically<00:01:28.920> because<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.640> bigger<00:01:29.850> than<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
basically because it's not bigger than a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.499 
basically because it's not bigger than a
box<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.710> chocolate<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:33.360> get

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
box of chocolate actually you get

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.870 
box of chocolate actually you get
everything<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.079> need

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
everything you need

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.120 
everything you need
whole<00:01:35.240> PC<00:01:35.659> basically<00:01:36.229> except<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:36.740> an<00:01:36.799> optical

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
whole PC basically except for an optical

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.330 
whole PC basically except for an optical
drive<00:01:37.930> so<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:38.990> end<00:01:39.229> up<00:01:39.380> with<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.979> device<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
drive so you end up with a device that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.270 
drive so you end up with a device that
is<00:01:40.670> very<00:01:40.909> powerful<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.600> still<00:01:41.990> tiny<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
is very powerful and still tiny on the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.560 
is very powerful and still tiny on the
biggest<00:01:43.820> platform<00:01:44.240> they<00:01:44.600> have<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:45.579> 4600<00:01:46.579> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
biggest platform they have on 4600 the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.660 
biggest platform they have on 4600 the
whole<00:01:47.720> system<00:01:48.140> consumes<00:01:48.590> about<00:01:48.740> 25<00:01:49.399> watts

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
whole system consumes about 25 watts

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.389 
whole system consumes about 25 watts
maybe<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.679> actually<00:01:51.860> actively

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
maybe and this one is actually actively

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:53.980 
maybe and this one is actually actively
cool<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:52.909> they<00:01:53.000> have<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.210> small<00:01:53.450> fan<00:01:53.689> in<00:01:53.810> here

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
cool so they have a small fan in here

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.050 
cool so they have a small fan in here
that<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.530> supposed<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:55.039> be<00:01:55.189> not<00:01:55.429> really<00:01:55.700> loud

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
that is supposed to be not really loud

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.690 
that is supposed to be not really loud
they're<00:01:56.390> saying<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:56.929> not<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.530> loud<00:01:57.740> let's

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
they're saying it's not that loud let's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.010 
they're saying it's not that loud let's
just<00:01:58.850> take<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.000> quick<00:01:59.179> look<00:01:59.329> around<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.899> I'll

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
just take a quick look around and I'll

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.020 
just take a quick look around and I'll
show<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.920> other<00:02:01.069> one<00:02:01.280> back<00:02:01.429> here<00:02:01.700> which

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
show you the other one back here which

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.139 
show you the other one back here which
is<00:02:02.179> actually<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:03.220> passively<00:02:04.220> cooled<00:02:04.579> system<00:02:04.789> so

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
is actually a passively cooled system so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.839 
is actually a passively cooled system so
no<00:02:05.509> noise<00:02:05.720> at<00:02:05.960> all<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.580> using<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> same

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
no noise at all and using the same

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.240 
no noise at all and using the same
platform<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:09.560> will<00:02:09.739> take<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> quick<00:02:10.130> look

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
platform this will take a quick look

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.710 
platform this will take a quick look
around<00:02:10.549> this<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.180> I'll<00:02:11.330> show<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
around this and then I'll show you the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
around this and then I'll show you the
PCB<00:02:12.170> they're<00:02:12.319> using<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.860> after<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.849> we'll

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
PCB they're using and after that we'll

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.199 
PCB they're using and after that we'll
talk<00:02:14.480> about<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.459> passively<00:02:16.459> cooled<00:02:16.790> model

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
talk about the passively cooled model

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.940 
talk about the passively cooled model
right<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.170> side<00:02:18.380> we<00:02:18.560> start<00:02:18.739> out

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
right here so on this side we start out

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.789 
right here so on this side we start out
with<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> USB<00:02:19.730> 3.0<00:02:20.269> port<00:02:20.299> full-size<00:02:21.200> that's

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
with a USB 3.0 port full-size that's

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.610 
with a USB 3.0 port full-size that's
recess<00:02:22.250> reset<00:02:22.819> button<00:02:23.209> right<00:02:23.420> there<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.810> on

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
recess reset button right there and on

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.339 
recess reset button right there and on
this<00:02:25.250> end<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.700> get<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.150> headset<00:02:26.750> jack<00:02:26.930> combined

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
this end you get a headset jack combined

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.009 
this end you get a headset jack combined
that's<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.220> check<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.610> audio<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.030> mic<00:02:29.329> you

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
that's a check for audio and mic you

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.170 
that's a check for audio and mic you
have<00:02:30.230> another<00:02:30.530> USB<00:02:31.519> 3<00:02:31.760> port<00:02:32.000> right<00:02:32.150> there

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
have another USB 3 port right there

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.490 
have another USB 3 port right there
that's<00:02:32.569> an<00:02:32.720> Ethernet<00:02:33.140> port<00:02:33.170> actually

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that's an Ethernet port actually

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.839 
that's an Ethernet port actually
integrated<00:02:34.099> where<00:02:34.220> there<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.459> some<00:02:34.640> mini

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
integrated where there are some mini

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.660 
integrated where there are some mini
HDMI<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.440> external<00:02:36.980> power<00:02:37.250> supply

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670

connector for your 12 volt power box on
the<00:02:42.049> other<00:02:42.200> side<00:02:42.380> that's<00:02:42.590> just<00:02:42.890> found<00:02:43.220> out

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the other side that's just found out

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.710 
the other side that's just found out
that's<00:02:43.519> right<00:02:43.760> there<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.209> that's<00:02:44.630> pretty

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
that's right there and that's pretty

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.580 
that's right there and that's pretty
much<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.079> on<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.410> one

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
much it on this one

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.630 
much it on this one
you<00:02:47.739> get<00:02:47.890> pretty<00:02:48.220> much<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> same

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you get pretty much the same

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.940 
you get pretty much the same
connectivity<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.950> passive-aggressively

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
connectivity on the passive-aggressively

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.979 
connectivity on the passive-aggressively
full<00:02:51.220> online<00:02:51.580> get<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.330> second<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
full online get to that in a second and

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.900 
full online get to that in a second and
this<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.319> basically<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.010> PCB<00:02:54.459> they're<00:02:54.640> using

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
this is basically the PCB they're using

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.369 
this is basically the PCB they're using
so<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> core<00:02:55.599> i7<00:02:55.989> in<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.170> middle

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
so you have the core i7 in the middle

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.259 
so you have the core i7 in the middle
right<00:02:56.440> here<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
right here on this one and the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.449 
right here on this one and the
connectors<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.680> side<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.310> it's

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
connectors on that side so it's

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.270 
connectors on that side so it's
basically<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.209> tiny<00:03:01.769> mobile<00:03:02.769> board

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
basically just a tiny mobile board

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.229 
basically just a tiny mobile board
adapted<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.780> be<00:03:05.379> used<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:06.340> small<00:03:06.610> box<00:03:06.910> on

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
adapted to be used in a small box on

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.420 
adapted to be used in a small box on
this<00:03:07.660> end<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.019> get<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.830> RAM<00:03:08.980> socket

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
this end you get just the RAM socket

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.740 
this end you get just the RAM socket
right<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:11.459> mini<00:03:12.459> pcie<00:03:12.819> express<00:03:12.910> or<00:03:13.540> M

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
right there and a mini pcie express or M

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.259 
right there and a mini pcie express or M
SATA<00:03:14.019> connector<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.430> other<00:03:15.610> end<00:03:16.000> right

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
SATA connector on the other end right

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.229 
SATA connector on the other end right
there<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.319> this<00:03:17.680> passively<00:03:18.459> whole<00:03:18.730> box<00:03:19.030> right

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
there and this passively whole box right

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.789 
there and this passively whole box right
here<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:19.630> connected<00:03:20.230> connected<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
here is actually connected connected to

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.589 
here is actually connected connected to
a<00:03:20.829> huge<00:03:21.190> TV<00:03:21.489> that's<00:03:21.790> actually<00:03:22.090> right<00:03:22.209> next<00:03:22.390> to

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
a huge TV that's actually right next to

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.860 
a huge TV that's actually right next to
me

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
me

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.800 
me
and<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:24.370> thing<00:03:24.610> gets<00:03:24.880> really<00:03:25.299> hot<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.660> mean

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
and this thing gets really hot I mean

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.259 
and this thing gets really hot I mean
like<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:27.130> putting<00:03:27.310> out<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.150> is

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
like it's putting out this one is

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.449 
like it's putting out this one is
actually<00:03:28.569> running<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.989> standard<00:03:29.440> 2.5<00:03:30.190> inch

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
actually running on a standard 2.5 inch

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually running on a standard 2.5 inch
hard<00:03:31.180> drive<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.569> you<00:03:31.630> can<00:03:31.720> have<00:03:32.019> up<00:03:32.049> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
hard drive so you can have up to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.860 
hard drive so you can have up to
whatever<00:03:32.920> those<00:03:33.310> two<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.790> happens<00:03:34.360> hard

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
whatever those two it happens hard

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.479 
whatever those two it happens hard
drives<00:03:35.110> actually<00:03:35.470> give<00:03:35.650> you<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.220> would

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
drives actually give you so I would

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.020 
drives actually give you so I would
guess<00:03:36.700> up<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.599> around<00:03:38.140> one<00:03:39.069> terabyte<00:03:39.459> or<00:03:39.730> more

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
guess up to around one terabyte or more

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.110 
guess up to around one terabyte or more
based<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.110> platform<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.890> again<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:43.090> end

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
based on that platform and again you end

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.520 
based on that platform and again you end
up<00:03:43.390> with<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.569> bunch<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.810> connectivity<00:03:44.230> options

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
up with a bunch of connectivity options

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.800 
up with a bunch of connectivity options
so<00:03:44.890> you<00:03:44.950> have<00:03:45.190> two<00:03:45.549> USB<00:03:45.700> sports<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.390> this<00:03:46.569> side

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
so you have two USB sports on this side

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.900 
so you have two USB sports on this side
that's<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> indicator<00:03:47.980> light<00:03:48.250> for<00:03:48.549> battery

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
that's the indicator light for battery

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.550 
that's the indicator light for battery
there's<00:03:49.360> Wi-Fi<00:03:49.540> integrated<00:03:50.260> than<00:03:50.349> this

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
