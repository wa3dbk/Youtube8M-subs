time value or shutter speed that's the

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.830 
time value or shutter speed that's the
dial<00:00:14.500> setting<00:00:15.280> on<00:00:15.429> the<00:00:15.759> top<00:00:15.969> of<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.630> camera

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.020 
dial setting on the top of the camera
and<00:00:17.200> if<00:00:17.740> I<00:00:17.860> were<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.130> change<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.550> dial<00:00:18.790> tis

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
and if I were to change the dial tis

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.710 
and if I were to change the dial tis
like<00:00:19.240> AV<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.890> is<00:00:21.130> your<00:00:21.760> aperture<00:00:22.150> setting

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
like AV which is your aperture setting

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.630 
like AV which is your aperture setting
you<00:00:22.840> can<00:00:22.990> then<00:00:23.170> dial<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:23.620> in<00:00:23.680> aperture

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
you can then dial that in aperture

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.080 
you can then dial that in aperture

it<00:00:25.240> doesn't<00:00:25.690> need<00:00:25.810> to<00:00:26.020> know<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.320> shutter<00:00:26.590> or

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
it doesn't need to know the shutter or

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.170 
it doesn't need to know the shutter or
you<00:00:27.220> don't<00:00:27.400> need<00:00:27.550> to<00:00:27.700> know<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:27.940> shutter

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
you don't need to know the shutter

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.000 
you don't need to know the shutter
because<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.660> compensates<00:00:29.020> for<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.560> if<00:00:29.890> you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
because it compensates for it if you

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.560 
because it compensates for it if you
were<00:00:30.130> in<00:00:30.190> a<00:00:30.280> manual<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.820> could<00:00:31.060> adjust<00:00:31.150> both

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
were in a manual you could adjust both

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.360 
were in a manual you could adjust both
and<00:00:31.840> both<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.020> them<00:00:32.320> are<00:00:32.410> up<00:00:32.529> there<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:32.920> if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
and both of them are up there and if

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.540 
and both of them are up there and if
you're<00:00:33.580> in<00:00:33.820> P<00:00:34.600> or<00:00:34.870> program<00:00:35.380> by<00:00:35.800> having<00:00:36.400> either

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
you're in P or program by having either

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.040 
you're in P or program by having either
up<00:00:36.760> there<00:00:37.000> that's<00:00:37.210> sort<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.570> telling<00:00:37.900> you<00:00:38.020> that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
up there that's sort of telling you that

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.510 
up there that's sort of telling you that
don't<00:00:38.440> worry<00:00:38.620> about<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:39.010> we'll<00:00:39.130> figure<00:00:39.370> out

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
don't worry about it we'll figure out

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.790 
don't worry about it we'll figure out
the<00:00:39.640> combination<00:00:40.300> of<00:00:40.360> both<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.780> we'll<00:00:41.440> keep<00:00:41.620> it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
the combination of both so we'll keep it

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.040 
the combination of both so we'll keep it
in<00:00:41.920> T<00:00:42.070> V<00:00:42.100> or<00:00:42.370> time<00:00:42.580> value<00:00:42.790> for<00:00:43.180> now<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.540> by<00:00:44.020> the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
in T V or time value for now and by the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.720 
in T V or time value for now and by the
way<00:00:44.260> if<00:00:44.380> you<00:00:44.470> want<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.740> do<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.890> jest<00:00:45.190> time<00:00:45.400> value

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
way if you want to do a jest time value

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.819 
way if you want to do a jest time value
you<00:00:45.880> hit<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.120> cue<00:00:46.390> button<00:00:46.570> use<00:00:47.230> your<00:00:47.410> four-way

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
you hit the cue button use your four-way

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.890 
you hit the cue button use your four-way
controller<00:00:48.250> on<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.550> back<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.210> get<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.720> and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
controller on the back to get to it and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.810 
controller on the back to get to it and
then<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:50.620> can<00:00:50.770> change<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.340> this<00:00:51.460> case<00:00:51.640> your

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
then you can change in this case your

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.770 
then you can change in this case your
shutter<00:00:52.030> speed<00:00:52.650> so<00:00:53.650> moving<00:00:54.130> on<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.540> right

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
shutter speed so moving on to the right

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
shutter speed so moving on to the right
you<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.770> your<00:00:56.820> ISO<00:00:57.820> here<00:00:58.239> plus<00:00:58.899> the<00:00:58.930> d-pad

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
you have your ISO here plus the d-pad

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.889 
you have your ISO here plus the d-pad
and<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.399> D<00:01:00.579> plus<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.360> highlight<00:01:01.720> tone

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
and the D plus the highlight tone

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.840 
and the D plus the highlight tone
priority<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:02.920> works<00:01:03.460> with<00:01:03.670> your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
priority so that works with your

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.330 
priority so that works with your
contrast<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.720> your<00:01:04.809> highlights<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.470> we'll

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
contrast and your highlights and we'll

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.640 
contrast and your highlights and we'll
be<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:06.700> into<00:01:06.970> that<00:01:07.090> on<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.870> DVDs<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> little

be going into that on the DVDs a little

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.399 
be going into that on the DVDs a little
later<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.250> then<00:01:09.900> we're<00:01:10.900> going<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.110> move<00:01:11.260> to

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
later and then we're going to move to

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.320 
later and then we're going to move to
the<00:01:11.530> next<00:01:11.740> row<00:01:11.950> here<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:13.000> I'm<00:01:13.060> going<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.210> hit

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
the next row here so I'm going to hit

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.910

dial to go back and forth and this is
your<00:01:27.280> exposure<00:01:27.610> compensation<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.630> if<00:01:28.780> I'm

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
your exposure compensation so if I'm

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.630 
your exposure compensation so if I'm
filming<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.440> musician<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.070> a<00:01:30.190> tent<00:01:30.460> and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
filming a musician in a tent and

filming a musician in a tent and
everything's<00:01:31.299> white<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> background<00:01:32.170> the

everything's white in the background the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.430 
everything's white in the background the
exposures<00:01:32.799> may<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> little<00:01:34.479> darker<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.380> you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
exposures may go a little darker so you

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.230 
exposures may go a little darker so you
want<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.799> basically<00:01:35.950> tell<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.520> camera<00:01:36.820> hey<00:01:37.000> I

want you to overexpose or suppose you're
in<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.220> situation<00:01:42.820> where<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.240> don't<00:01:43.390> know<00:01:43.780> how

in a situation where you don't know how
the<00:01:44.710> shots<00:01:45.189> are<00:01:45.369> going<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.549> come<00:01:45.729> out

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the shots are going to come out

the shots are going to come out
overexposed<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.689> underexposed<00:01:46.890> you're<00:01:47.890> going

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
overexposed or underexposed you're going

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.100 
overexposed or underexposed you're going
to<00:01:48.100> use<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.369> front<00:01:48.640> dial<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.210> then<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.900> could

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
to use the front dial and then you could

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.170 
to use the front dial and then you could
have<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.530> auto<00:01:50.770> exposure<00:01:51.159> bracketing<00:01:51.580> which

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
have the auto exposure bracketing which

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.149 
have the auto exposure bracketing which
means<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.900> take<00:01:53.110> three<00:01:53.380> pictures<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.010> one's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
means you take three pictures and one's

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.999 
means you take three pictures and one's
going<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.400> be<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.600> case<00:01:55.840> one<00:01:56.229> stop<00:01:56.590> under

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
going to be in this case one stop under

pick the shot you want afterwards that's

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.060 
pick the shot you want afterwards that's
great<00:02:01.659> for<00:02:01.810> landscapes<00:02:02.020> especially<00:02:02.590> when

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070

more<00:04:35.270> pictures<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.530> see<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.860> can<00:04:37.010> dial

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
more pictures and you see you can dial

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.070 
more pictures and you see you can dial
it<00:04:37.370> all<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.639> way<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:37.790> that's<00:04:38.510> with<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> raw

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it all the way up that's with the raw

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.260 
it all the way up that's with the raw
and<00:04:39.620> then<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.160> could<00:04:40.310> dial<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:40.940> get<00:04:41.060> rid

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
and then you could dial it up to get rid

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.379 
and then you could dial it up to get rid
of<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.449> raw<00:04:41.600> they<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.500> not<00:04:42.850> 999<00:04:43.850> pictures

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.810 
of the raw they have not 999 pictures
now<00:04:44.570> keep<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.960> mind<00:04:45.199> that<00:04:45.830> it's<00:04:46.190> actually<00:04:46.580> more

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
now keep in mind that it's actually more

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.240 
now keep in mind that it's actually more
than<00:04:46.970> 199<00:04:47.720> pictures<00:04:48.110> that's<00:04:48.560> how<00:04:48.800> much<00:04:49.010> the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
than 199 pictures that's how much the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.530 
than 199 pictures that's how much the
counter<00:04:49.610> goes<00:04:49.790> up<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.270> there<00:04:51.050> so<00:04:51.520> there<00:04:52.520> is<00:04:52.760> the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
counter goes up to there so there is the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.350 
counter goes up to there so there is the
