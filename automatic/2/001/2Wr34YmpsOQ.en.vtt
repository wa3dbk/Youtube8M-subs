not<00:03:09.400> quite<00:03:09.610> sure<00:03:11.520> most<00:03:12.520> of<00:03:12.760> us<00:03:12.910> are<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.270> of

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
not quite sure most of us are out of

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.190 
not quite sure most of us are out of
breath<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.960> have<00:03:14.290> headaches<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:17.110> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
breath and have headaches because of the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:43.600 
breath and have headaches because of the
altitude

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.890 

so<00:03:45.220> for<00:03:46.220> those<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:47.380> climb<00:03:48.380> on<00:03:48.410> these<00:03:48.680> reps

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
so for those of you climb on these reps

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.400 
so for those of you climb on these reps
that<00:03:50.900> couldn't<00:03:51.320> come<00:03:51.590> here<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.170> court

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
that couldn't come here to the court

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:01.150 
that couldn't come here to the court
ideally<00:03:54.770> I<00:03:54.800> blanka's<00:03:55.690> what<00:03:56.690> eyes<00:03:57.520> this<00:04:00.160> is

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
ideally I blanka's what eyes this is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.840 
ideally I blanka's what eyes this is
Lake<00:04:01.460> 69<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:04.130> it's<00:04:04.280> called<00:04:04.520> one<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
Lake 69 I think it's called one of the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.340 
Lake 69 I think it's called one of the
most<00:04:05.090> beautiful<00:04:05.240> lakes<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:06.020> not<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.320> most

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
most beautiful lakes if not the most
