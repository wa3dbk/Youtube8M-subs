00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:31.470
 Well, my name is David and everyone 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 our kids a curro jiménez 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.520
 and for another study of the load 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.110
 sergio the guitar in curro jiménez 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 I met the guides of Mike 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.790
 Well, I'm Jordi and I've been here for a year and 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 half with them playing bass and 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.230
 truth is that very well 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.800
 yes 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 Well, since we 're looking for a man 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.230
 it turns out that the former memo bassist 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.290
 always in our hearts' 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.450
 I spent a day going up from July 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.330
 jiménez and he and I were really blown away 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.790
 with the series it seemed incredible is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.280
 authentic to all the values ​​of those who 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.510
 he talked about everything we thought was incredible and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.510
 in the rain of 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.190
 well then in all that suddenly 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.230
 it arose not be the kill in curro jiménez 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.560
 hosts and curro jiménez jiménez el 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.570
 perfect name and surname is already there and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.370
 there he stayed 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 we did the analogy with groups 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.670
 Americans as Charles Bronson groups 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.190
 of hardware ita that were then that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 also a fictional character and not if 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.740
 they have a room, they are doing something 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.030
 logically because we are cooler than 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030
 an eight that happened of madrid 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.180
 Well, it is clear that Jorge Mérida 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.990
 spoke of those who talk a lot in the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:08.509
 values of friendship loyalty of 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.970
 Help the helpless from help to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.690
 village 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.580
 and the rich fight for what you fight 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 Exactly yours and take care of you 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.909
 same 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.900
 to fight for what belongs to you and already 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.900
 is fighting for your kisses 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.060
 four years if we go already 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.060
 four years leads corregimientos 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.239
 We were when the previous band 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 we 3 played together before 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.750
 We were about 7 years 80 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.720
 what we were lengthened two others by 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.960
 there just two or three and then we live in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960
 this group 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.930
 the biggest influence is everything comes from 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.800
 from the hardcore 80s spoon always 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 everything that has always been created at 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.650
 end of the 70s and early 80s 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.650
 bands like clicking the flag 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.569
 to pains 3 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.490
 since it is known if there is a million 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.380
 bands you know all the hack about everything 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.380
 leave with an ash size 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.390
 above all they have influenced us a lot 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.430
 the groups that came out in 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.430
 in American escape videos 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.959
 a bit the reference of the bands that 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.590
 for example is one of the bands that 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.390
 right now I think that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.680
 our influence a lot even by 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.019
 example bands like rock sport the crypt 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.739
 also in many things they influence us 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.170
 those are bands that do not all come from 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.569
 those videos that we watched but have also 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.239
 emerged the roots of those groups that 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.459
 we saw other bands go out and you go 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.190
 knowing like a lot of bands and 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.610
 clear suddenly when the time passes 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.019
 you're getting to know more bands of others from 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.099
 same style even more modern we 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.370
 they are arriving 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.650
 what amused me what I can 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.709
 to have fun is to make the music that I 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.239
 I listened when I had fun with what 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.760
 we like it more when we are so last 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.920
 edition or if this already sounds like such and 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.410
 comes that moment when old but 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.959
 rich with 16 years old he went by found skate 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.180
 with your colleagues is freaking out in the 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.330
 only small joint where they would put it if 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.430
 you were freaking out of them, that's 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.820
 the roll of perhaps the influences of 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.820
 the bands 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 there are many bands that we liked 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.099
 but I think the vital influence more 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.689
 what they are and things that are obviously there 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.590
 because the sound is there the music is 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:44.050
 there but it's more an influence 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.969
 we come a tradition because the point is 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.349
 music obviously but for us the 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.830
 punt that is everything for us the 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.110
 public because that's what it is for you is what 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.479
 that we have not raised are the ideas are 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.219
 ideas are the locals the first ones in 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.650
 we were all our friends 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.740
 together all the people of Móstoles are 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.199
 with colleagues have fun 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.500
 and that is doing what we do 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.970
 then liked almost 40 tacos and follow 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.449
 doing the same as when we have and 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.000
 that's why we really continue with the same 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.400
 history is the one that does nothing we comment 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.940
 one thing that is important that is how 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.340
 when I come to me to my local 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.009
 essay should all bakalas as if they're going 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.229
 to his cartwheel and his cow things 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.669
 I was going to my rehearsal room with 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.660
 my colleagues and crashing first I went from 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.660
 fucking mother with them 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.530
 is in that suddenly one day sergio I 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:52.080
 we had recently addition and we said 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.139
 uncle fuck I've seen fulano seen 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.940
 mengano and as time has passed put 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.730
 know if we 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.190
 we continue the same we do not continue the same 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.260
 we follow now better we have matured more 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.630
 of our life I have my job ten 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.630
 jobs but we keep doing this 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.410
 it's because at that moment they made us 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.230
 happy and at this moment I do not 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.220
 let's make it so long maybe we touch 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.300
 much more than equal or more equal or more 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.880
 happy 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.430
 they are surprised that he still has the same 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.690
 and moriles when I was 16 years old and is 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.670
 I'm still going to a concert of a look 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.410
 of a band that I like and follow me 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.000
 putting the hair on end and I continue 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.840
 feeling the same as then or more 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.480
 because I fuck I 'm an old fucking 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.020
 and I'm pretty much old government 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.699
 but I'm not 15 years old anymore, although 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.199
 4.000 we give four thousand laps to 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.750
 Any 20-year-old kid in any 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.750
 thing in party and feel things 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.820
 a hard spirit we are athletes of 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.820
 elite 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.160
 and that is 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.440
 well I throw the TV I said
