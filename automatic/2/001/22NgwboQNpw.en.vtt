00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
the real colors so it will give you the

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.260 
the real colors so it will give you the

will has deep colors on the Gameboy and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.670 
will has deep colors on the Gameboy and
it's<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:22.780> you're<00:04:23.110> playing<00:04:23.260> on<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.500> field

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
it's like you're playing on the field

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.340 
it's like you're playing on the field
Gameboy<00:04:24.420> next<00:04:25.420> step<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> go<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.140> boy<00:04:26.320> I

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
Gameboy next step in the go to the boy I

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.920 
Gameboy next step in the go to the boy I
already<00:04:26.740> set<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> normal<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.390> that's

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
already set it to normal and that's

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.050 
already set it to normal and that's
really<00:04:29.500> does<00:04:29.710> any<00:04:29.890> what<00:04:30.070> priority<00:04:30.580> does<00:04:30.820> but

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
really does any what priority does but

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.850 
really does any what priority does but
it's<00:04:31.210> like<00:04:31.540> set<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.080> normal<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.560> guess

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
it's like set it to normal I guess

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.190 
it's like set it to normal I guess
and<00:04:33.640> that's<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.880> good<00:04:34.030> filters<00:04:34.540> not<00:04:34.810> here<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200
