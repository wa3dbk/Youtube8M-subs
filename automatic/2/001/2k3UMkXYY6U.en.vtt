dr. functional medicine today I want to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.339 
dr. functional medicine today I want to
talk<00:00:11.190> about<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> benefits<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.030> l-glutamine

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
talk about the benefits of l-glutamine

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.799 
talk about the benefits of l-glutamine
powder<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.969> l-glutamine<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.240> an<00:00:15.389> amino<00:00:15.690> acid

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
powder and l-glutamine is an amino acid

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
powder and l-glutamine is an amino acid
that<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:16.980> very<00:00:17.160> abundant<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> human

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
that is very very abundant in the human

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.820 
that is very very abundant in the human
body<00:00:18.270> especially<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:18.990> musculoskeletal

tissue and l-glutamine is used primarily

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
tissue and l-glutamine is used primarily
today<00:00:24.210> actually<00:00:24.750> first<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.230> used<00:00:25.410> mostly

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
today actually first it was used mostly

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
today actually first it was used mostly
by<00:00:25.830> people<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> fitness<00:00:27.390> industry<00:00:27.689> people

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
by people in the fitness industry people

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630 
by people in the fitness industry people
that<00:00:28.349> were<00:00:28.439> looking<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> preserve<00:00:29.220> muscle

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that were looking to preserve muscle

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.720 
that were looking to preserve muscle
tissue<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.420> both<00:00:30.990> lose<00:00:31.380> weight<00:00:31.710> burn<00:00:32.130> fat<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
tissue so both lose weight burn fat and

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
tissue so both lose weight burn fat and
gain<00:00:32.910> muscle<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> most<00:00:34.200> common<00:00:34.590> uses<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
gain muscle for the most common uses of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
gain muscle for the most common uses of
l-glutamine<00:00:35.130> powders<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.210> see

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
l-glutamine powders then you can see

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.200 
l-glutamine powders then you can see
l-glutamine<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> basically<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.370> sort

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
l-glutamine is basically it's this sort

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.680 
l-glutamine is basically it's this sort
of<00:00:39.329> white<00:00:39.600> powder<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.690> there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of white powder here you can see there

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
of white powder here you can see there
on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> tip<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.230> finger<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.250> just

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
on the tip of my finger but it's just

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.830 
on the tip of my finger but it's just
it's<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.760> amino<00:00:45.000> acid<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's just an amino acid which is a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's just an amino acid which is a
building<00:00:46.260> block<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> protein<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.149> are

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
building block of protein but there are

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
building block of protein but there are
many<00:00:48.600> benefits<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.230> l-glutamine<00:00:49.550> along<00:00:50.550> with

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
many benefits of l-glutamine along with

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
many benefits of l-glutamine along with
so<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> mentioned<00:00:51.719> building<00:00:52.350> muscle<00:00:52.829> losing

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so I mentioned building muscle losing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
so I mentioned building muscle losing
weight<00:00:54.030> burning<00:00:54.510> fat<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.140> addition<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
weight burning fat in addition to that a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
weight burning fat in addition to that a
glutamine<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> help<00:00:57.570> heal<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.050> repair

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
glutamine also can help heal and repair

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.529 
glutamine also can help heal and repair
your<00:00:58.530> gut<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.789> millions<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.480> people

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
your gut so there are millions of people

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
your gut so there are millions of people
today<00:01:00.960> struggling<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> condition<00:01:02.100> called

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
today struggling with a condition called

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
today struggling with a condition called
leaky<00:01:02.489> gut<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:04.320> basically<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> main

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
leaky gut which is basically the main

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.760 
leaky gut which is basically the main
cause<00:01:05.729> today<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> autoimmune<00:01:06.720> disease<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
cause today of autoimmune disease the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
cause today of autoimmune disease the
main<00:01:07.920> cause<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> thyroid<00:01:08.939> issues<00:01:09.210> like

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
main cause of thyroid issues like

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
main cause of thyroid issues like
Hashimoto's<00:01:10.170> disease<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.189> causes

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Hashimoto's disease it also causes

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870 
Hashimoto's disease it also causes
arthritis<00:01:12.409> skin<00:01:13.409> issues<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> psoriasis<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
arthritis skin issues like psoriasis and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.070 
arthritis skin issues like psoriasis and
so<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.229> caused<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:16.710> leaky<00:01:17.159> gut<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
so that's caused by leaky gut and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.539 
so that's caused by leaky gut and
l-glutamine<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> number<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.189> amino<00:01:20.430> acid

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
l-glutamine is the number one amino acid

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
l-glutamine is the number one amino acid
your<00:01:21.540> gut<00:01:21.900> needs<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.830> help<00:01:23.100> heal<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.759> repair

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
your gut needs to help heal and repair

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
your gut needs to help heal and repair
leaky<00:01:24.509> gut<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.710> any<00:01:26.070> type<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
leaky gut and so if you have any type of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.730 
leaky gut and so if you have any type of
digestive<00:01:27.180> issue<00:01:27.299> whatsoever<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
digestive issue whatsoever what I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.069 
digestive issue whatsoever what I
believe<00:01:29.130> by<00:01:29.369> far<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.060> most<00:01:30.240> important<00:01:30.930> amino

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
believe by far the most important amino

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.310 
believe by far the most important amino
acid<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> need<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:31.979> diet<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
acid you need in your diet is

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
acid you need in your diet is
l-glutamine<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> regular<00:01:35.520> basis<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
l-glutamine on a regular basis and so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
l-glutamine on a regular basis and so
again<00:01:36.600> using<00:01:36.810> l-glutamine<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> great<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
again using l-glutamine is great but I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
again using l-glutamine is great but I
recommend<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.180> typically<00:01:39.509> between<00:01:39.960> 2<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> 5

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
recommend is typically between 2 to 5

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.420 
recommend is typically between 2 to 5
grams

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450 
grams
twice<00:01:42.119> daily<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.649> two<00:01:43.890> forms<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
twice daily and there are two forms of

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.649 
twice daily and there are two forms of
l-glutamine<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.420> regular

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
l-glutamine you can get regular

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
l-glutamine you can get regular
l-glutamine<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.829> what's<00:01:47.220> called<00:01:47.399> it's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
l-glutamine and it's what's called it's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270 
l-glutamine and it's what's called it's
free<00:01:47.880> form<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.500> taken<00:01:49.950> with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
free form and that should be taken with

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.870 
free form and that should be taken with
food<00:01:50.750> ideally<00:01:51.799> because<00:01:52.799> basically<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.790> it's

not taken with food it's not absorbed as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
not taken with food it's not absorbed as
well<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:56.909> another<00:01:57.299> type<00:01:57.689> of

well or there's another type of
l-glutamine<00:01:58.500> called

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
l-glutamine called
