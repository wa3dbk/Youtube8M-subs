 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.610
 and that's how we read the title 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.610
 to talk about oil and stains 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.070
 surely someday you have seen some 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.020
 image where the author used the spots 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.419
 good but what do I mean with the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.480
 stains as such as well as 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.759
 listeners do not paint with spots and 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:46.900
 there are indeed many paintings and there are 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:48.760
 many authors who use it all that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.370
 once a teacher told me to master the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.200
 stain is something very very complex and he 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.990
 told a story I said I went to a 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.690
 exhibition then and some paintings that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.120
 They were great and I went up to 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.910
 see them carefully and I realized 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 that were pure spots was incredible the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 effect 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.890
 and I 'm not going to tell you to do this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.050
 type of paintings is very much required 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.060
 knowledge but that is required 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.490
 great practice because you have to know 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.340
 about the color on the tones on the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.160
 contrast to be able to use each spot to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.830
 your favor as well as pencil drawing 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.620
 the line is very important and with a 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.750
 line you can create great things like 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.340
 in painting techniques also if 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.130
 you know how to master the stain 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.230
 you can create very interesting things 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.840
 and above all it takes away that feeling 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.270
 as a detail and leaves it as in a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.670
 sketch but a sketch that looks very good 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:53.470
 personally I like this technique 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 a lot then if you like it you already know how 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.150
 you can start practicing simply 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.520
 grabbing your brush the spatula or in a 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.980
 digital program like this one that is art 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.320
 Reich and start practicing 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.290
 principle is a bit complex but you're going to 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.840
 see over time the base go dominating and 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.310
 the result will be awesome look 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.760
 these artists what they have got 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 do 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.170
 and good friends this was all for this 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.900
 video remember the stain is very 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940
 important was a short video but that 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.950
 does not mean that this is not great 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.810
 value so remember if you use 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.750
 traditional techniques like oil 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.820
 acrylic wash the stain will give you a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.820
 very nice touch to your paintings
