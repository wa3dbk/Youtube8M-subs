00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I've still got a chance regardless of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
I've still got a chance regardless of
whether<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.250> not<00:00:44.340> I've<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> specs<00:00:44.910> left<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
whether or not I've got the specs left I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
whether or not I've got the specs left I
don't<00:00:45.480> feel<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.410> biggest<00:00:46.770> point<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
don't feel like my biggest point of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't feel like my biggest point of
damage<00:00:48.059> dealing<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> ER<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.760> granite

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
damage dealing is the ER is the granite

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
damage dealing is the ER is the granite
Moore<00:00:51.149> itself<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> feel<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> ovum

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
Moore itself I feel like it's the ovum

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
Moore itself I feel like it's the ovum
all<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> DDS<00:00:53.460> most<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> time<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.300> since

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
all in the DDS most the time but since

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.240 
all in the DDS most the time but since
we<00:00:54.870> don't<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> tedious<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> album<00:00:56.070> all

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
we don't have the tedious the album all

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.950 
we don't have the tedious the album all
will<00:00:56.610> obviously<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.780> made

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
will obviously do but I think we made

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
will obviously do but I think we made
I've<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.590> speck<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.010> left<00:00:59.210> against<00:01:00.210> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
I've got one speck at left against this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
I've got one speck at left against this
but<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.260> point<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:02.370> we're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
but now it's at the point where we're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.630 
but now it's at the point where we're
both<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> spec<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.250> low<00:01:05.489> on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
both out of spec but I'm very low on

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
both out of spec but I'm very low on
food<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:07.380> could<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.740> been

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
food right now and that could have been

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.280 
food right now and that could have been
a<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.340> decent<00:01:08.580> hit<00:01:08.909> had<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> I'm<00:01:09.659> kept<00:01:09.990> going

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
a very decent hit had it I'm kept going

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
a very decent hit had it I'm kept going
but<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.549> he's<00:01:11.729> we've<00:01:12.060> both<00:01:12.270> drained<00:01:12.600> each

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
but yeah he's we've both drained each

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.800 
but yeah he's we've both drained each
other's<00:01:13.049> food<00:01:13.229> quite<00:01:13.979> well<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:15.600> should

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
other's food quite well and they should

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
other's food quite well and they should
end<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.770> yeah<00:01:17.100> there's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
end up well I don't think yeah there's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
end up well I don't think yeah there's
gotta<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.750> will<00:01:18.960> allow<00:01:19.500> him<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> do

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
gotta be much that will allow him to do

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
gotta be much that will allow him to do

gym or it could have been nice but I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170 
gym or it could have been nice but I
think<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:25.319> happened<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:27.150> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
think what happened there is what I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.809 
think what happened there is what I
didn't<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.319> my<00:02:28.680> correct<00:02:29.400> amulet

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
didn't actually have my correct amulet

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.760 
didn't actually have my correct amulet
on<00:02:29.910> at<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> time<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.500> would<00:02:31.620> have

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
on at the time so that would have

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.860 
on at the time so that would have
actually<00:02:31.980> helped<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.550> lot<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.180> did<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.540> but

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
actually helped a lot if I did that but

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.230 
actually helped a lot if I did that but

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
where he was putting it but hopefully he

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.720 
where he was putting it but hopefully he
does<00:03:58.290> he<00:03:58.470> doesn't<00:03:58.890> hit<00:03:59.100> too<00:03:59.130> high<00:03:59.519> on<00:03:59.549> the

does he doesn't hit too high on the
Rambo's<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:00.600> looks<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.079> he<00:04:01.290> didn't<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.860> fact

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
had it been so much higher I think 46 is

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.320 
had it been so much higher I think 46 is
my<00:05:54.900> max<00:05:55.170> here<00:05:55.440> I<00:05:55.620> can<00:05:56.520> neither<00:05:56.730> confirm<00:05:57.060> nor

my max here I can neither confirm nor

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.840 
my max here I can neither confirm nor
deny<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.900> but<00:05:58.440> it'd<00:05:58.980> be<00:05:59.100> nice<00:05:59.310> if<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.610> can<00:05:59.760> it

deny that but it'd be nice if I can it

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.910 
deny that but it'd be nice if I can it
somewhere<00:06:00.270> around<00:06:00.360> that<00:06:00.540> ballpark<00:06:00.780> oh<00:06:01.230> I<00:06:01.530> she

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
somewhere around that ballpark oh I she

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.990 
somewhere around that ballpark oh I she
ate<00:06:02.070> there<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.840> 44<00:06:03.840> there<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.200> goes<00:06:04.410> its<00:06:04.790> 12<00:06:05.790> more

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.240 
ate there I 44 there it goes its 12 more
higher<00:06:06.390> and<00:06:06.720> then<00:06:07.230> we've<00:06:07.470> hit<00:06:07.650> our<00:06:07.680> max<00:06:08.040> here<00:06:08.220> I

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
