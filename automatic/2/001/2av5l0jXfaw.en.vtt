make way for nocturnal strike you're
just<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.390> Powerball<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.959> back<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
just going to Powerball you back and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.570 
just going to Powerball you back and
forth<00:02:23.470> he's<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.739> slowly<00:02:23.920> ramp<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.400> his

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
forth he's in the slowly ramp up his

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.960 
forth he's in the slowly ramp up his
speed<00:02:24.850> that's<00:02:25.030> not<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> big<00:02:25.690> deal<00:02:26.970> so

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
speed that's not really a big deal so

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.520 
speed that's not really a big deal so
this<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.239> where<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> strategy<00:02:29.200> comes<00:02:29.410> into

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
this is where the strategy comes into

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.360 
this is where the strategy comes into
play<00:02:29.770> are<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.070> hit<00:02:30.130> him<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.340> that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
play are going to hit him with that

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.699 
play are going to hit him with that
nocturnal<00:02:31.000> strike<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.780> see<00:02:31.810> he's

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
nocturnal strike and as you can see he's

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.590 
nocturnal strike and as you can see he's
real<00:02:33.100> low<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.550> life<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.000> we<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:34.330> this

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
real low in life but we have this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.510 
real low in life but we have this
grounding<00:02:35.320> effect<00:02:35.650> on<00:02:35.830> him<00:02:35.980> from<00:02:36.100> his<00:02:36.280> grasp

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
grounding effect on him from his grasp

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640 
grounding effect on him from his grasp
so<00:02:36.880> we're<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.510> going<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.750> pass<00:02:38.020> these<00:02:38.320> next

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
so we're just going to pass these next

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.550 
so we're just going to pass these next
rounds<00:02:39.010> until<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:40.239> grass<00:02:40.540> becomes<00:02:40.989> free<00:02:41.410> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
rounds until that grass becomes free and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.259 
rounds until that grass becomes free and
we're<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.370> go<00:02:42.459> ahead<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.760> hit<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> pet

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
we're going to go ahead and hit the pet

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.910 
we're going to go ahead and hit the pet
switch<00:02:43.540> into<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.170> tune<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.620> we're<00:02:44.769> going<00:02:44.860> to
