 [Music] 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.020
 there is a huge chance that you will know 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.000
 who is jaspion or actually justin 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 main character of the course series 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.399
 of metal heroes that today the Tucson or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 justin the mega special investigator 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.420
 justin beasts that was translated into 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.360
 brazil like jaspion the original name 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.729
 just that one was a junction of words 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 justice and champion literally champion 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.709
 of justice 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.049
 the series originated in Japan in 1985 though 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.929
 It was very popular in Brazil, not 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.939
 It was like that in Japan and I do not know why. 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.709
 The whole episode is already ending with 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.789
 he frantically dancing you 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.679
 I would imagine it would be a success. 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.630
 but you probably already 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.549
 You know all that you might not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.799
 know that one of the great influences 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.319
 on spatial sheriffs as fair 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.670
 was surgery in the stars 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.039
 original of the three teams that were 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.379
 launched in 1977 81 83 and the first series 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.810
 metal heroes space floor they stayed 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.209
 was released in 1982 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.709
 believe in these dates are not for nothing 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.100
 after the Second World War 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.290
 finished in 1945 both Japan and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.840
 United States were in a process of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.609
 economic and cultural reconstruction and a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.769
 of the major elements used to 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.519
 entertaining the people or the economy post 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 war 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.480
 with the advent of television productions 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.310
 aimed at children with the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.410
 goal of generating income and moving 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.769
 economy and from this era we have a 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.019
 big explosion of animation productions 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.940
 series of superhero movies and the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.790
 same time a huge and rich history 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.569
 between the United States and awe 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.970
 Japan 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.280
 numerous collaborative works and the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.410
 influenced by one another. 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 and one of the works that best shows 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.540
 this correlation is the first film of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.730
 star wars episode 4 when compared to 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.829
 jazz time series we have soon in the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.620
 first episode our young hero is 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.959
 innocent of the dangers of space in his 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.480
 simple white clothing walking plaque 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.459
 desert and poorly developed until it 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.489
 knows one of hermits with powers 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.030
 that reveals secrets and the name of the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.359
 villain 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.850
 the great villain of the satanic series 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.070
 literally ghost of satan 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.950
 and at the same time literally darth 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.290
 vader he is so vader art that satan goals 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.000
 are two five-letter words and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.370
 darth vader are also two words 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.590
 five letters and both names seem 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.360
 fuck and does not mean anything at all 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.460
 just a wheel 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.110
 Incidentally the Japanese side of jaspion is well 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.300
 visible when we say that it is about 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.220
 a series where the hero follows the prophecy 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.050
 of the bible to find the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.280
 galaxy van guitars 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.050
 I'm not exaggerating this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.780
 entirely the story of jazz trio 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.540
 which besides has two companions 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.480
 the first line the android that serves you 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.610
 help, and then I 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.860
 to a small being who also keeps 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.720
 secrets and does not communicate right alias 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.670
 the scene where we met her being 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.070
 attacked by hooded thugs in a 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.960
 valley in the desert and soon after 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.420
 to be the brother to a city in the 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.340
 assistance and entered a 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.890
 club full of music and races 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.989
 aliens from other planets and the 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.880
 At the same time he seems to have innocent fun. 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.070
 and people who are not necessarily 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.710
 good sindonis over there and this is evident 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.020
 enough for you and I think it's mine 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.240
 it is not that I have already brought a full copy of 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.040
 star wars say this is ignorance until 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.320
 because soon after you have the path of the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.050
 giant robot fighting the monsters 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.880
 giants star wars do not have this 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.650
 I probably should have maybe 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.550
 would have made the new technology not be 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.440
 crap 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.570
 and it is not that the bridges influences 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.000
 just star wars 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.950
 in the second episode there is a scene that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.320
 is a direct tribute to a scene from the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.910
 film 2001 an odyssey in space and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.010
 A lot of people like to say that 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.100
 darth vader was influenced by another 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.780
 japanese toco villain 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.840
 specifically to fall see a villain of the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.850
 series that has fallen since 1972 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.550
 five years before the first film of 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.040
 star wars very obvious relevance right 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.750
 in fact not this information is 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.640
 assigned an interview that nobody saw 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.160
 nobody knows where it came from and no one 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.260
 can confirm is an internet myth 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.600
 propagated at seven winds without any 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.820
 evidence or evidence what is well known is 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.980
 that george lucas confirmed that there are 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.110
 Japanese influences in the design of 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.640
 schneider in particular of the armors 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.410
 traditional samurai 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.249
 but another influence confirmed by the 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.619
 own lucas for the character of giving 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.969
 sell is the lightning villain of the series of 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:41.609
 american tv fighting gave the docs of 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:44.399
 1938 not only in visible influence and 

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:46.019
 bridging this influence is 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.399
 noticed that it is there also left 

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:49.499
 elements that influenced the 

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:50.939
 Star Wars stormtroopers 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.669
 if someday you meet someone 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.339
 saying that jackson copied star wars 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.499
 who is the Japanese website co-pilots of a 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.599
 slap in the mouth of this ignorant Diego 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.589
 caps lock ticket sent 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.989
 to do this 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.669
 This is not a simple copy. Plagiarism is 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:08.429
 the true cultural element of 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.869
 history a bridge in two nations if 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:12.839
 rebuilding after a war 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:16.949
 devastatingly finding common admiration in 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:19.319
 fiction, imagination and fantasy of one another 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.449
 these effects reflect multiple 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.789
 mobile work uganda was 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:26.369
 influenced by stellar troops 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.589
 jiban was influenced by robocop and 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.879
 this admiration influence endures until 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.949
 today 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.799
 and this is the true story that counts 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.689
 It's worth being told and I hope you 

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:38.759
 have also tended to scratch themselves 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.889
 the surface of a large series of 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.869
 past as it was jaspion and that perhaps 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.549
 you open your eyes to look at 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.649
 some of the series to his childhood and 

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:48.719
 maybe go back there a touch of another 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:50.849
 mythology culture because in addition to 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.159
 surface there is much more than 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.199
 mere stories for children 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:07:00.349
 My name was use this is the channel that 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.349
 locke and I'll see you in the next video
