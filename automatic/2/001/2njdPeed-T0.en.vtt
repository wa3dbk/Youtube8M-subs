what<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> deal<00:00:15.150> was<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.289> for

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
what what the deal was what was that for

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.580 
what what the deal was what was that for
some<00:00:17.580> odd<00:00:17.850> reason<00:00:17.990> I'm<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.170> entirely<00:00:19.470> sure

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
some odd reason I'm not entirely sure

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.250 
some odd reason I'm not entirely sure
why<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.939> I've<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> few<00:00:21.480> theories<00:00:21.840> but

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
why this was I've got a few theories but

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.400 
why this was I've got a few theories but
for<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:22.980> reason<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.060> Centaur<00:00:24.510> camp<00:00:24.779> spawned

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
for some reason the Centaur camp spawned

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.540 
for some reason the Centaur camp spawned
champions<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.750> only<00:00:28.160> camp<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

with the sent us now the exception to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.650 
with the sent us now the exception to
that<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.770> additional<00:00:41.340> events<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.969> cool

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that was the additional events so cool

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
excess flame Legion that kind of event
that<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.780> spawn<00:00:46.050> champions<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.559> well<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that would spawn champions as well so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.340 
that would spawn champions as well so
you<00:00:47.129> had<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> bit<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> variety<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.350> obviously

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you had a bit of variety there obviously

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.799

Luke<00:00:54.719> banks<00:00:55.610> but<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.789> some<00:00:57.000> weird<00:00:57.030> reason

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Luke banks but for some weird reason

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.560 
Luke banks but for some weird reason
there<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.260> always<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:59.070> three<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.550> four<00:00:59.579> sent

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there was always two three or four sent

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
there was always two three or four sent
our<00:01:00.780> champions<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.620> obviously<00:01:02.609> they'd<00:01:03.000> go

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
our champions and obviously they'd go

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
our champions and obviously they'd go
down<00:01:03.510> really<00:01:03.719> quickly<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.260> they're

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
down really quickly because they're

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.880 
down really quickly because they're
facing<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.040> zerg<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.320> they'd<00:01:07.320> respond<00:01:07.770> very

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
facing a zerg and they'd respond very

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.440 
facing a zerg and they'd respond very
quickly<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> idea<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
quickly because that's the idea of this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.640 
quickly because that's the idea of this
area<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.850> back<00:01:11.850> farming<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.930> pretty

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
area so back farming was was pretty

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.880 
area so back farming was was pretty
ludicrous<00:01:13.890> I'll<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.490> honest<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.290> I'd<00:01:16.290> known<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
ludicrous I'll be honest but I'd known I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.230 
ludicrous I'll be honest but I'd known I
think<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.490> either<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> problem<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
think that was either a problem with the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.330 
think that was either a problem with the
scaling<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.170> areas<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:20.189> weren't

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
scaling of the other areas they weren't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.310 
scaling of the other areas they weren't
scaling<00:01:20.850> properly<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> allow<00:01:21.659> champions<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
scaling properly to allow champions to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.170 
scaling properly to allow champions to
spawn<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.280> centaurs<00:01:23.700> were<00:01:23.880> scaling

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
spawn all the centaurs were scaling

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.990 
spawn all the centaurs were scaling
wrong<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.400> was<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.790> complete

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
wrong or it was just a complete

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
wrong or it was just a complete
oversight<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.810> Reno<00:01:28.080> Nets<00:01:28.320> part<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.829> either

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
oversight on a Reno Nets part but either

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069 
oversight on a Reno Nets part but either
way<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> best<00:01:30.540> place<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> found

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
way that was the best place to found

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.210 
way that was the best place to found
champions<00:01:31.610> not<00:01:32.610> anymore<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:34.009> we're<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
champions not anymore so we're back to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
champions not anymore so we're back to
the<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.579> old<00:01:35.759> question<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> dungeons<00:01:36.780> verse

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.249 
got so i'm probably heading back to
Queens<00:02:03.630> Dale

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.900 

so<00:02:08.259> my<00:02:08.560> main<00:02:08.770> question<00:02:09.009> when<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.520> comes<00:02:09.670> to

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
so my main question when it comes to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.660 
so my main question when it comes to
champion<00:02:10.330> farming<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.840> what<00:02:11.319> counts<00:02:11.680> because

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
champion farming is what counts because

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.750 
champion farming is what counts because
obviously<00:02:13.480> they're<00:02:14.200> making<00:02:14.530> exceptions<00:02:14.860> they

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
obviously they're making exceptions they

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.309 
obviously they're making exceptions they
actually<00:02:16.150> made<00:02:16.300> exceptions<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
actually made exceptions for the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.680 
actually made exceptions for the
champions<00:02:17.770> included<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.970> jaw<00:02:19.209> mag<00:02:19.390> event

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
champions included in the jaw mag event

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.040 
champions included in the jaw mag event
which<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.500> curious<00:02:21.480> considering<00:02:22.480> i<00:02:22.750> did<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
which was curious considering i did a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.350 
which was curious considering i did a
video<00:02:23.230> talking<00:02:24.069> about<00:02:24.610> whether<00:02:24.850> they<00:02:25.090> will<00:02:25.239> be

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
video talking about whether they will be

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.260 
video talking about whether they will be
included<00:02:25.750> or<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:27.700> also<00:02:27.970> now

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
included or not but they also now

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.050 
included or not but they also now
removed<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.170> champion<00:02:29.890> centaurs<00:02:30.489> from<00:02:30.880> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
removed the champion centaurs from the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.270 
removed the champion centaurs from the
loot<00:02:31.209> list<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.080> whereas<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.860> might<00:02:32.890> be

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
loot list so whereas it might be

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.410 
loot list so whereas it might be
champion<00:02:34.150> inverted<00:02:34.900> commas<00:02:35.260> loot<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:37.180> seems

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
champion inverted commas loot it seems

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
champion inverted commas loot it seems
to<00:02:37.569> be<00:02:37.600> specific<00:02:38.319> champions<00:02:38.980> loot<00:02:39.519> which

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
to be specific champions loot which

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.440 
to be specific champions loot which
obviously<00:02:41.980> becomes<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.880> problem<00:02:43.030> if<00:02:43.330> you're

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
obviously becomes a problem if you're

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.880 
obviously becomes a problem if you're
trying<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.720> look<00:02:43.900> at<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.080> best<00:02:44.290> way<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> farm

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
trying to look at the best way to farm
