 fact number one coatings is the fusion 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 between song breads and trance the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.090
 by performing the fusion dance 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.329
 It is said that one had two hotels 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.399
 his first appearance in the busacca yes 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.280
 He was also in the complete series only 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.640
 to see in busacca yes he has 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.670
 also appear in films but how 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 said in series were only in the busacca 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.350
 there number three 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 to carry out the fusion at all 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 could have had song offerings and chance 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.219
 These are first taught song 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 bochum led them the movements 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.299
 together with piccolo before them 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 knew what you need to do song broken 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.470
 Of course, after a set 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.540
 dead back to the afterlife 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 so piccolo was training for the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.940
 both responsible fact number four 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 the perfect fusion worked only when 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.660
 third try the other two times 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 screwed it up 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 the first time this funny appeared 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.630
 thick stallion who had barely endurance 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.420
 So totally unsuitable for one 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.090
 That's why the fight had to wait 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.730
 and try the fusion again 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.270
 the second time it was still 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.040
 worse then came this old one 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.050
 struggle 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.600
 so they had to wait again and at the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.350
 third try then it worked 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.680
 fact number 5 the character of boatengs 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.130

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.990
 and drank yes for example he is arrogant and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.090
