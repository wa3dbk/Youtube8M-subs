00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.230
 no it's round this morning on lacanau 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.520
 hello to all of you when 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 start the day with a time that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160
 is released at variable a temperature 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.540
 outside at creysse in front of a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 water temperature at 16 degrees a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.989
 swamp that is finishing off 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 up the plan and at 9:40 with 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.570
 coefficients of 62 on this end of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 rising tide 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.890
 the wind has passed is north-east - 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 strong words a jester the body of water is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.489
 quite smooth again a little bit restless 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 stormy and we have a swell and that was 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.480
 the long with 13 seconds periods 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.700
 West to West and North West 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 swell returning multi spike upward 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.910
 however the series are widely spaced 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.189
 bigger series then between them 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.159
 almost all waters where all 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.350
 ten minutes it 's banging on those big 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.000
 served to put a being 30 green 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 but when there are these three series that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 what does it happen the ars did 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 outline with lots of spades in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.500
 the lines that shifts a lot ago 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.330
 a few rare spots where his rival 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.560
 it's a bit to unwind a bit but 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.870
 spades are linked together it's a little fast 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.940
 but a few openings and if not the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.410
 majority of other areas it looks like 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.050
 that of eva that happens to double and has 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.040
 closed together so terrible it 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.330
 makes that Czech surfers 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.550
 conditions are not very busy at 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.960
 water and surfers focus the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.310
 rare surfers focuses on 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.140
 places where it happens to unfold a little 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.300
 but beware these agitated it's not 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.380
 obvious caught because most of the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.090
 time there are little hands when he 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.270
 there are no series at the height of 1 m 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.320
 and here we are board and small peaks that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.729
 gets to spend but when there are 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.800
 big series like that happens with bacon 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.020
 that it thinks to those bekale his bar 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.070
 it's not obvious what the evolution for 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.479
 the rest of the day where he goes 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.369
 continue to swell the wind make me a 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.930
 little like yesterday still weak enough in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.050
 first part of the day maybe 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.880
 strengthen north-northwest in the after 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.369
 noon until you have a water plan 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 sheepish or not or maybe the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.600
 have coast arcachon went successful and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.760
 1 59 seconds to 13h we should have a 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.590
 meter twenty meters 50 or the west and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.780
 west and northwest 12 second period 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.060
 so is often north or east of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.489
 beaufort of 80 little bit weaker and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 at 17h to put 50 or west to west 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.970
 north-west 12 second period and one 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.709
 often waits north northwest three 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.940
 strong words that tax or 3 4 with 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.299
 a few drops we will see what's going 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.250
 give 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.959
 I'll let you know the next 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.110
 could be 11:30 at all to go to 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.110
 bed 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.650
 here
