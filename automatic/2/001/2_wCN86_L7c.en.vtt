00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
wall alright so the first thing I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
wall alright so the first thing I
noticed<00:02:50.610> from<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.849> person<00:02:51.239> who's<00:02:51.360> sitting<00:02:51.630> here

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
noticed from a person who's sitting here

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
noticed from a person who's sitting here
and<00:02:52.079> their<00:02:52.200> point<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.530> view<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:52.920> they

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and their point of view is that they

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.470 
and their point of view is that they
have<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> truck<00:02:53.519> directly<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.120> front<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.420> them

have a truck directly in front of them

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940 
have a truck directly in front of them
so<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.079> think<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.410> myself<00:02:55.530> they're

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
so then I think to myself they're

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.710 
so then I think to myself they're
probably<00:02:56.130> looking<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.880> towards<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.329> left

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
probably looking more towards the left

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.960 
probably looking more towards the left
over<00:02:58.019> here<00:02:58.349> possibly<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.579> window<00:02:59.790> to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
over here possibly up in the window to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.210 
over here possibly up in the window to
the<00:03:00.120> left<00:03:00.209> or<00:03:00.780> maybe<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.349> dirt<00:03:01.590> path<00:03:01.950> on

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the left or maybe on the dirt path on

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.250 
the left or maybe on the dirt path on
the<00:03:02.280> left<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.760> finally<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.840> very<00:03:03.989> likely

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the left and finally but not very likely

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.910 
the left and finally but not very likely
near<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.069> tractor<00:03:05.519> over<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> right

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
near this tractor over here on the right

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
near this tractor over here on the right
alright<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.099> keeping<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.549> mind<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.819> they

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
alright so keeping in mind that they

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.460 
alright so keeping in mind that they
have<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.180> difficult<00:03:09.569> time<00:03:09.599> seeing<00:03:09.989> directly

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
have a difficult time seeing directly

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.870 
have a difficult time seeing directly
ahead<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.799> them<00:03:10.920> what<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> want<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.519> do<00:03:11.670> is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
ahead of them what you want to do is

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.430 
ahead of them what you want to do is
jump<00:03:12.060> right<00:03:12.239> up<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.510> top<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:13.049> propane

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
jump right up on top of this propane

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.140 
jump right up on top of this propane
tank<00:03:13.680> right<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.430> most<00:03:14.700> people<00:03:14.819> don't

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
tank right here which most people don't

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
tank right here which most people don't
think<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.450> can<00:03:15.569> actually<00:03:15.720> jump<00:03:16.049> up<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.349> top<00:03:16.530> of

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
think you can actually jump up on top of

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.110 
think you can actually jump up on top of
and<00:03:16.920> shoot<00:03:17.370> them<00:03:17.459> directly<00:03:17.790> through<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
and shoot them directly through the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.240 
and shoot them directly through the
fence<00:03:18.329> it's<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.900> pretty<00:03:19.109> easy<00:03:19.350> shot<00:03:19.470> pretty

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
fence it's a pretty easy shot pretty

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
fence it's a pretty easy shot pretty
simple<00:03:20.579> but<00:03:20.880> again<00:03:21.000> not<00:03:21.510> very<00:03:21.780> commonly<00:03:22.170> used

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
simple but again not very commonly used

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.990 
simple but again not very commonly used
and<00:03:22.709> it's<00:03:22.859> very<00:03:23.130> difficult<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.730> enemy<00:03:23.970> to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
and it's very difficult for the enemy to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.059 
and it's very difficult for the enemy to
see<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:28.139> next<00:03:28.410> spot<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.590> want<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.889> show<00:03:29.010> you

going to be able to be looking down a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.520 
going to be able to be looking down a
scope<00:03:46.019> when<00:03:46.230> you<00:03:46.350> run<00:03:46.590> past<00:03:46.829> him<00:03:48.350> alright<00:03:49.350> so

what I recommend you do to counter this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.360 
what I recommend you do to counter this
is<00:03:51.450> run<00:03:51.840> directly<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.560> your<00:03:52.650> left<00:03:52.889> as<00:03:53.100> soon<00:03:53.220> as

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
is run directly to your left as soon as

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.039 
is run directly to your left as soon as
you<00:03:53.489> spawn<00:03:53.760> putting<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.359> head<00:03:54.540> down<00:03:54.569> making

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
you spawn putting your head down making

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.870 
you spawn putting your head down making
yourself<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.530> smaller<00:03:55.799> target<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.400> then<00:03:56.790> you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
yourself a smaller target and then you

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.339 
yourself a smaller target and then you
should<00:03:57.060> use<00:03:57.209> your<00:03:57.329> mini-map<00:03:57.750> for<00:03:57.959> direction

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
should use your mini-map for direction

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.839 
should use your mini-map for direction
to<00:03:58.530> make<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.160> block<00:03:59.519> right<00:03:59.549> here

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
to make it to this block right here

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.849 
to make it to this block right here
stand<00:04:00.720> up<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:00.959> top<00:04:01.139> of<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.680> should

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
stand up on top of it and you should

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.530 
stand up on top of it and you should
have<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.220> perfect<00:04:02.670> line<00:04:02.819> of<00:04:02.940> sight<00:04:03.150> directly

have a perfect line of sight directly

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.660 
have a perfect line of sight directly
into<00:04:03.900> their<00:04:04.019> spawn<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.829> should<00:04:05.040> be<00:04:05.069> an<00:04:05.430> easy

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
into their spawn this should be an easy

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.940 
into their spawn this should be an easy
kill<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.359> they<00:04:06.540> will<00:04:06.690> never<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.170> coming

show you is how to quickly kill anybody
running<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.950> be<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.570> predictable<00:04:22.970> so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
running to be and not be predictable so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.640 
running to be and not be predictable so
because<00:04:24.330> most<00:04:24.599> people<00:04:24.900> will<00:04:25.110> run<00:04:25.320> directly

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
because most people will run directly
