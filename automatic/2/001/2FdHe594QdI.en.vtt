00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.890 
a design still going to stand on its
feet<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.100> going<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.280> fall<00:01:46.490> apart<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.480> we

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
feet is it going to fall apart so we

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.050 
feet is it going to fall apart so we
made<00:01:48.080> sure<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.470> part<00:01:49.370> of<00:01:49.430> our<00:01:49.550> job<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:50.030> to

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
made sure of that part of our job is to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.910 
made sure of that part of our job is to
come<00:01:50.330> up<00:01:50.480> with<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.690> real<00:01:50.960> pure<00:01:51.200> theme<00:01:51.530> or

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
come up with a real pure theme or

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710 
come up with a real pure theme or
something<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.790> know<00:01:52.880> people<00:01:52.910> identify

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
something that you know people identify

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.600 
something that you know people identify
immediately<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.860> know<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.190> can<00:01:55.340> relate<00:01:55.550> to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
immediately you know they can relate to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.750 
immediately you know they can relate to
the<00:01:55.880> original<00:01:56.810> cars<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:58.040> progressive<00:01:58.550> but

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the original cars and is progressive but

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.280 
the original cars and is progressive but
something<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.270> could<00:01:59.630> translate<00:02:00.020> into

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
something that could translate into

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.950 
something that could translate into
production<00:02:00.800> as<00:02:01.190> well<00:02:01.250> I'm<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.450> interior<00:02:02.900> I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
production as well I'm the interior I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.740 
production as well I'm the interior I
think<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.400> theme<00:02:04.670> translated<00:02:05.540> really

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
think the the theme translated really

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.139 
think the the theme translated really
well<00:02:05.900> obviously<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.340> concept<00:02:07.760> i<00:02:07.970> took

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
well obviously in the concept i took

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.540 
well obviously in the concept i took
some<00:02:08.330> some<00:02:08.899> liberties<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.890> had<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.250> make<00:02:10.399> some

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
some some liberties and had to make some

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.630 
some some liberties and had to make some
compromises<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.920> wouldn't<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.400> able<00:02:13.459> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
compromises that you wouldn't be able to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.250 
compromises that you wouldn't be able to
do<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.849> production<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> angle<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
do in production like the angle of the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.130 
do in production like the angle of the
IP<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.129> center<00:02:16.430> stack<00:02:16.780> pretty<00:02:17.780> much<00:02:17.930> took

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
IP in the center stack pretty much took

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.380 
IP in the center stack pretty much took
all<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.530> out<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.069> for<00:02:19.610> production<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.300> know

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
all that out but for production you know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.330 
all that out but for production you know
we<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.750> certain<00:02:21.440> radios<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.010> things<00:02:22.190> that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we have certain radios and things that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.759 
we have certain radios and things that
we<00:02:22.400> use<00:02:22.550> HVAC<00:02:23.060> systems<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.500> know<00:02:24.590> are

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
we use HVAC systems that you know are

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.709 
we use HVAC systems that you know are
going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.040> be<00:02:25.129> incorporated<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.420> design

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719 
going to be incorporated in the design

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.730 
going to be incorporated in the design
but<00:02:27.079> as<00:02:27.409> far<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
but as far as the you know the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
but as far as the you know the
and<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.220> doors<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.790> important<00:02:30.270> parts

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and the doors and the important parts

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.780 
and the doors and the important parts
that<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.620> want<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.040> communicated<00:02:32.550> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that I really want to get communicated I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.490 
that I really want to get communicated I
think<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.210> did<00:02:33.390> an<00:02:33.480> excellent<00:02:33.870> job<00:02:34.050> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
think they did an excellent job it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.590 
think they did an excellent job it's
it's<00:02:34.860> really<00:02:35.010> going<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> show<00:02:35.460> sometimes<00:02:36.450> you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
it's really going to show sometimes you

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.280 
it's really going to show sometimes you
see<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.990> trade-offs<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:39.180> most<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
see the trade-offs and I think most the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.170 
see the trade-offs and I think most the
trade-offs<00:02:40.770> they've<00:02:41.100> done<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.400> try<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:41.910> get

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
trade-offs they've done to try and get

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720 
trade-offs they've done to try and get
it<00:02:42.300> into<00:02:42.420> production<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:43.200> been<00:02:43.490> really<00:02:44.490> good

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
it into production have been really good

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
it into production have been really good
decisions<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.760> right<00:02:47.790> sometimes<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
decisions but you're right sometimes you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.750 
decisions but you're right sometimes you
think<00:02:48.780> wow<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.440> know<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.830> wonder<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.640> could

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
think wow you know I wonder if we could

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160 
think wow you know I wonder if we could
have<00:02:50.880> done<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.300> little<00:02:51.540> bit<00:02:51.750> differently

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
have done that a little bit differently

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.040 
have done that a little bit differently
or<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.740> but<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> think<00:02:54.030> overall<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:54.900> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
or this but I think overall that all the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.080 
or this but I think overall that all the
decisions<00:02:55.500> were<00:02:55.620> made<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.100> were<00:02:56.220> we're

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
decisions were made on it were we're

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.240 
decisions were made on it were we're
really<00:02:57.300> good<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:57.960> think<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.590> couple

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
really good and I think the couple

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.000 
really good and I think the couple
things<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.810> may<00:03:00.810> lack<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.110> tiny<00:03:01.650> bit<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
things that may lack a tiny bit of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.660 
things that may lack a tiny bit of
purity<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.490> think<00:03:02.940> will<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.300> overlooked

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.339 

cool<00:03:09.910> too<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.240> we<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.690> melting<00:03:10.959> pot

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
cool too is we have a good melting pot

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.050 
cool too is we have a good melting pot
of<00:03:11.380> designers<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.280> know<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.580> gallons<00:03:12.940> from

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.480 

mine<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:43.879> basically<00:05:44.599> just<00:05:44.710> kind<00:05:45.710> of<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.949> an

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
mine is basically just kind of a an

mine is basically just kind of a an
architectural<00:05:47.180> type<00:05:47.449> lettering<00:05:47.930> but<00:05:48.349> it's

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
architectural type lettering but it's

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.050 
architectural type lettering but it's
completely<00:05:48.650> different<00:05:49.129> than<00:05:49.430> what<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.759> signed

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
completely different than what I signed

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.999 
completely different than what I signed
checks<00:05:50.419> would<00:05:50.599> so<00:05:50.990> it's<00:05:51.229> just<00:05:51.500> kind<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.800> my

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
checks would so it's just kind of my

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.520 
checks would so it's just kind of my
sketch<00:05:52.569> signature<00:05:53.569> but<00:05:53.990> it's<00:05:54.139> somewhat

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
sketch signature but it's somewhat

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.439 
sketch signature but it's somewhat
legible<00:05:54.949> where<00:05:55.310> my<00:05:55.520> check<00:05:55.879> one<00:05:56.090> is<00:05:56.240> just

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
legible where my check one is just

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.279 
legible where my check one is just

come up with a unique see so I started

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.460 
come up with a unique see so I started
doing<00:06:07.669> this<00:06:07.909> sort<00:06:08.120> of<00:06:08.210> backwards<00:06:08.479> stroke<00:06:09.139> see

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.779 
that crossed the tea and kind of just
stuck<00:06:12.560> so<00:06:12.830> I've<00:06:12.949> been<00:06:13.069> doing<00:06:13.430> it<00:06:13.550> ever<00:06:13.669> since

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
stuck so I've been doing it ever since
