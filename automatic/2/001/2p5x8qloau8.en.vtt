00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
and then you've got the unconscious bar
so<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.420> wait<00:00:27.660> until<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
so you have to wait until the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.980 
so you have to wait until the
unconscious<00:00:29.250> bar<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> pretty<00:00:29.910> big<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.330> well<00:00:30.630> so

unconscious bar is pretty big as well so
until<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> taming<00:00:32.070> beats<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.790> much

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

dinosaurs right if you're going into
that<00:02:54.760> inventory<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.930> sitter<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.500> their

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that inventory a sitter have like their

that inventory a sitter have like their
own<00:02:56.769> weight<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.400> stuff<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.209> can<00:02:58.239> just

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
own weight and stuff so you can just

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.870 
own weight and stuff so you can just
store<00:02:58.840> everything<00:02:59.799> on<00:02:59.920> these<00:03:00.069> guys<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.519> try

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
to put berries on them because I think

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.890 
to put berries on them because I think
berries<00:03:03.280> don't<00:03:03.489> go<00:03:03.730> off<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.269> they're<00:03:04.510> inside<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
berries don't go off if they're inside a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.750 
berries don't go off if they're inside a
dinosaur<00:03:05.410> quite<00:03:05.950> me<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.220> I'm<00:03:06.340> wrong<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:06.700> I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
dinosaur quite me if I'm wrong but I

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520 
dinosaur quite me if I'm wrong but I
think<00:03:06.849> they<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.420> think<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:07.930> slower<00:03:08.290> or

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
think they I think it's slower or

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.900 
think they I think it's slower or
something<00:03:08.799> they'd<00:03:08.980> they<00:03:09.160> don't<00:03:09.610> like

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
something they'd they don't like

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.240 
something they'd they don't like
disappear<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.019> it's<00:03:11.590> pretty<00:03:11.709> good<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.010> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
disappear so it's pretty good so I just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.339 
disappear so it's pretty good so I just
keep<00:03:12.370> all<00:03:12.580> my<00:03:12.640> berries<00:03:13.090> on<00:03:13.299> my<00:03:13.690> dinosaur<00:03:14.170> most

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
keep all my berries on my dinosaur most

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.710 
keep all my berries on my dinosaur most
the<00:03:14.440> time<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.860> also<00:03:15.310> my<00:03:15.580> seeds<00:03:15.880> anything<00:03:16.600> that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the time and also my seeds anything that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.900 
the time and also my seeds anything that
I<00:03:16.750> don't<00:03:16.900> really<00:03:17.320> need<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.709> carry<00:03:18.010> like<00:03:18.400> often

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
I don't really need to carry like often

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.330 
I don't really need to carry like often
so<00:03:19.090> normally<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> put<00:03:19.660> some<00:03:19.840> fiber<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.829> them<00:03:21.040> so

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
so normally I put some fiber on them so

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220 
so normally I put some fiber on them so
I<00:03:21.489> just<00:03:21.670> use<00:03:21.820> them<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> carry<00:03:22.329> my<00:03:22.510> things<00:03:22.780> most

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
I just use them to carry my things most

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.780 
I just use them to carry my things most
of<00:03:23.380> time<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.859> also<00:03:24.190> we're<00:03:24.280> gonna<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.519> tame

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
of time and also we're gonna go tame

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.030 
of time and also we're gonna go tame
another<00:03:25.150> dinosaur<00:03:25.570> which<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.230> power<00:03:26.620> pair

more narco berries that guy took about

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.890 
more narco berries that guy took about
70<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.010> 80<00:04:12.040> narco<00:04:12.880> berries<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.329> keep<00:04:13.480> down<00:04:13.630> not

long<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:51.099> we're<00:04:51.370> put<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.699> blue<00:04:52.120> bit<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.509> the

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
long so we're put the blue bit of the

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.360 
long so we're put the blue bit of the
purple<00:04:52.990> berries<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.349> find<00:04:53.620> work<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.159> bit<00:04:54.310> better

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
purple berries I find work a bit better

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.159 
purple berries I find work a bit better
this<00:04:54.819> is<00:04:54.879> my<00:04:55.120> opinion<00:04:55.539> I<00:04:55.659> don't<00:04:55.719> know<00:04:55.930> if<00:04:56.050> they

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
this is my opinion I don't know if they

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.529 
this is my opinion I don't know if they
do<00:04:56.229> actually<00:04:56.979> work<00:04:57.159> I<00:04:57.520> haven't<00:04:58.000> really<00:04:58.210> got<00:04:58.419> it

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
do actually work I haven't really got it

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.480 
do actually work I haven't really got it
if<00:04:58.659> it's<00:04:58.810> like<00:04:58.990> full-on<00:04:59.529> combos<00:05:00.129> of<00:05:00.340> this

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
if it's like full-on combos of this

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.760 
if it's like full-on combos of this
stuff<00:05:00.729> but<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.180> think<00:05:01.719> that<00:05:01.840> works<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.560> also

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
stuff but I think that works and also

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.499 
stuff but I think that works and also
put<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.129> red<00:05:03.310> berries<00:05:03.699> in<00:05:03.849> there<00:05:04.029> and<00:05:04.150> see<00:05:04.300> how

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
put the red berries in there and see how

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.510 
put the red berries in there and see how
that<00:05:04.569> goes<00:05:05.050> let's<00:05:05.500> have<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:05.680> look<00:05:05.889> at<00:05:05.979> his<00:05:06.129> thing

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
that goes let's have a look at his thing

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.540 
that goes let's have a look at his thing
now<00:05:06.840> yeah<00:05:07.840> it's<00:05:07.990> 55%<00:05:08.830> that's<00:05:09.069> good<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.279> think

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
now yeah it's 55% that's good I think

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.459 
now yeah it's 55% that's good I think
it's<00:05:09.879> the<00:05:10.029> more<00:05:10.150> hungry<00:05:10.509> years<00:05:10.719> as<00:05:10.930> well<00:05:11.110> it'll

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
it's the more hungry years as well it'll

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.260 
it's the more hungry years as well it'll
increase<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.129> percentage<00:05:12.580> but<00:05:12.789> anyways<00:05:13.060> it's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
increase the percentage but anyways it's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.600 
increase the percentage but anyways it's
55<00:05:13.779> of<00:05:14.020> 54<00:05:14.589> percent<00:05:14.979> now<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:15.279> that's<00:05:15.430> pretty

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
55 of 54 percent now so that's pretty

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.540 
55 of 54 percent now so that's pretty
good<00:05:15.849> but<00:05:16.270> anyways<00:05:16.479> I'll<00:05:16.599> be<00:05:16.719> back<00:05:16.990> when<00:05:17.469> he's

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
good but anyways I'll be back when he's

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.700 
good but anyways I'll be back when he's
fixed<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.729> ready<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.120> go<00:05:19.449> okay<00:05:20.289> guys<00:05:20.469> I<00:05:20.650> think

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
fixed and ready to go okay guys I think

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.040 
fixed and ready to go okay guys I think
dinosaurs<00:05:21.490> like<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.819> purple<00:05:22.419> berries<00:05:22.810> better

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
dinosaurs like the purple berries better

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.749 
dinosaurs like the purple berries better
so<00:05:23.259> if<00:05:23.319> you<00:05:23.409> get<00:05:23.529> the<00:05:23.620> purple<00:05:23.889> of<00:05:24.400> these

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
so if you get the purple of these

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.850 
so if you get the purple of these
berries<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.360> think<00:05:26.050> they<00:05:26.139> like<00:05:26.379> them<00:05:26.589> more

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
berries I think they like them more

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.769 
berries I think they like them more
because<00:05:27.099> they<00:05:27.310> focus<00:05:27.879> on<00:05:28.029> them<00:05:28.300> more<00:05:28.629> than

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
because they focus on them more than

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.649 
because they focus on them more than
anything<00:05:29.729> yes<00:05:30.729> he<00:05:30.879> improved<00:05:31.240> yeah<00:05:31.389> almost

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
anything yes he improved yeah almost

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.480 
anything yes he improved yeah almost
everything<00:05:32.259> so<00:05:32.500> yeah<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:32.889> grows<00:05:33.099> things

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
everything so yeah it grows things

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.760 
everything so yeah it grows things
faster<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:34.419> yeah<00:05:34.870> I<00:05:34.900> think<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.439> percentage

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
faster so yeah I think the percentage

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.889 
faster so yeah I think the percentage
yeah<00:05:36.099> the<00:05:36.189> percentage<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.669> going<00:05:37.000> up<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.449> think

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:37.899 
yeah the percentage is going up I think

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.469 
yeah the percentage is going up I think
I<00:05:38.349> know<00:05:38.860> it's<00:05:39.009> not<00:05:39.069> going<00:05:39.310> down<00:05:39.399> still<00:05:39.879> but

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
I know it's not going down still but

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.790 
I know it's not going down still but
actually<00:05:40.779> no<00:05:40.930> it's<00:05:41.080> going<00:05:41.199> up<00:05:41.379> it's<00:05:41.529> going<00:05:41.680> up

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
actually no it's going up it's going up

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.439 
actually no it's going up it's going up
it's<00:05:41.919> going<00:05:42.009> up<00:05:42.219> that's<00:05:42.490> pretty<00:05:42.699> good<00:05:42.849> so<00:05:43.270> the

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
it's going up that's pretty good so the

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.119 
it's going up that's pretty good so the
purple<00:05:43.779> berries<00:05:43.960> yeah<00:05:44.229> see<00:05:44.439> focus<00:05:44.919> on<00:05:45.039> the

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
purple berries yeah see focus on the

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:46.889 
purple berries yeah see focus on the
purple<00:05:45.460> berries<00:05:45.759> and<00:05:45.939> the<00:05:46.300> purple<00:05:46.629> berries

purple berries and the purple berries

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.769 
purple berries and the purple berries

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
increase their late taming faster which

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.480 
increase their late taming faster which
