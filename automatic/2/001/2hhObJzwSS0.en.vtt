their radio real old $20 and it's a

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.999 
their radio real old $20 and it's a
little<00:00:16.670> expensive<00:00:17.300> for<00:00:17.330> this<00:00:17.630> but<00:00:18.020> I<00:00:18.289> went

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
little expensive for this but I went

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.290 
little expensive for this but I went
ahead<00:00:19.099> and<00:00:19.400> did<00:00:19.580> it<00:00:19.730> it's<00:00:19.880> kind<00:00:20.089> of<00:00:20.119> like<00:00:20.269> a

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
ahead and did it it's kind of like a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.320 
ahead and did it it's kind of like a
little<00:00:20.570> pig<00:00:20.810> nose<00:00:21.019> you<00:00:21.289> know<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.330> little

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
little pig nose you know with the little

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.140 
little pig nose you know with the little
handle<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:24.830> can<00:00:25.009> plug<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.400> in<00:00:25.550> or<00:00:25.849> do

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
handle you can plug it in or do

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.179 
handle you can plug it in or do
batteries<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.050> I'm<00:00:27.410> gonna<00:00:27.589> go<00:00:27.800> ahead<00:00:27.919> and

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
batteries but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.099 
batteries but I'm gonna go ahead and
remove<00:00:28.460> all<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:28.789> wires<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.570> everything<00:00:29.960> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
remove all this wires and everything and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.659 
remove all this wires and everything and
just<00:00:30.140> go<00:00:30.289> batteries<00:00:30.859> get<00:00:31.009> rid<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.310> antenna

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
just go batteries get rid of the antenna

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.279 
just go batteries get rid of the antenna
and<00:00:31.820> everything<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:34.899> going<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:35.960> see<00:00:36.140> what

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
and everything and going to see what

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.750 
and everything and going to see what
this<00:00:36.469> is<00:00:36.789> little<00:00:37.789> lamps<00:00:38.239> big<00:00:38.600> tone<00:00:39.760> my

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
this is little lamps big tone my

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.370 
this is little lamps big tone my
daughter's<00:00:41.180> here<00:00:41.359> to<00:00:41.539> inspect<00:00:41.989> it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.960 

okay<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> show<00:00:47.580> you<00:00:47.640> how<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
okay and I'm going to show you how it

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.840 
okay and I'm going to show you how it
did<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.710> let<00:00:49.710> me<00:00:49.740> turn<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.040> off<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
did it let me turn it off this really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
did it let me turn it off this really
needs<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> work<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:55.680> tapped<00:00:55.950> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
needs a lot of work I just tapped in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.070 
needs a lot of work I just tapped in
right<00:00:56.400> into<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.000> right<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:58.580> and<00:01:00.080> I'm

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
right into the back right there and I'm

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.080 
right into the back right there and I'm
sure<00:01:01.110> there's<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.770> gazillion<00:01:02.489> different<00:01:02.730> ways

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
sure there's a gazillion different ways

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.720 
sure there's a gazillion different ways
but<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:04.470> only<00:01:04.559> two<00:01:04.650> wires<00:01:04.980> coming<00:01:05.400> from

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
but there's only two wires coming from

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.630 
but there's only two wires coming from
the<00:01:06.090> guitar<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.690> positive<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> negative

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the guitar the positive and negative

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.090 
the guitar the positive and negative
negative<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> positive<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> overrode<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.620> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
negative and positive and overrode it so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.290 
negative and positive and overrode it so
there's<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.550> FM<00:01:11.940> radio<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.970> really

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
there's no more FM radio and it really

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.450 
there's no more FM radio and it really
sounds<00:01:15.690> we're<00:01:15.870> really<00:01:16.080> great<00:01:16.410> it's<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sounds we're really great it's got the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
sounds we're really great it's got the
right<00:01:17.610> size<00:01:17.940> it's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:18.570> small<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> don't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
right size it's not too small you don't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.040 
right size it's not too small you don't
want<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.410> too<00:01:19.560> small<00:01:19.860> okay<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.690> done

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
want it too small okay so it's all done

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.620 
want it too small okay so it's all done
I've<00:01:25.380> hack<00:01:26.310> wired<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:27.090> transistor

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I've hack wired this little transistor

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.219 
I've hack wired this little transistor
radio<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:29.550> sounds<00:01:30.090> almost<00:01:30.300> identical<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
radio and it sounds almost identical to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.430 
radio and it sounds almost identical to
a<00:01:31.380> pig<00:01:31.740> nose<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.430> gonna<00:01:33.150> play<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.320> then

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
a pig nose I'm gonna play it and then

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.890 
a pig nose I'm gonna play it and then
I'll<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> pig<00:01:35.100> nose<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.300> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I'll play the pig nose and you can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
I'll play the pig nose and you can
barely<00:01:37.170> hear<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.560> difference<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.130> both

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
barely hear the difference they both

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.400 
barely hear the difference they both
drive<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.450> same<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.050> think<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.350> have

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
drive the same that think they have

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.640 
drive the same that think they have
similar<00:01:41.040> circuitry<00:01:41.670> um<00:01:43.070> here<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:45.650> I'll

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
similar circuitry um here it is I'll

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.789 
similar circuitry um here it is I'll
open<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.130> back<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.369> show<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.759> how<00:01:47.910> I<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.150> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
open the back and show you how I did it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
open the back and show you how I did it
not<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> batteries<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:51.630> camera<00:01:51.869> dying<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
not the batteries on my camera dying so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850 
not the batteries on my camera dying so
I<00:01:52.619> got<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:52.979> two<00:01:53.189> minutes

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.120 

and<00:01:57.310> that's<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.000> about<00:01:58.090> half<00:01:58.480> setting<00:01:59.130> so

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
and that's it about half setting so

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
and that's it about half setting so
let's<00:02:00.430> go<00:02:00.610> into<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:03.190> pig<00:02:03.430> nose

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.790 

it's<00:02:16.100> almost<00:02:16.340> identical<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:18.590> has<00:02:18.770> a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's almost identical and this has a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.040 
it's almost identical and this has a
much<00:02:19.040> smaller<00:02:19.190> speaker<00:02:19.820> too<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.240> way

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.950 

so<00:02:24.560> overdrive<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.940> need<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.660> little

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
so overdrive it's gonna need a little

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.120 
so overdrive it's gonna need a little
bit<00:02:27.110> of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
bit of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.940 
bit of
so<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.850> is

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.910 

you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.940 

okay<00:02:44.519> my<00:02:44.670> camera<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.239> flashing<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.019> let<00:02:46.709> me<00:02:46.830> go

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
okay my camera is flashing so let me go

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.530 
okay my camera is flashing so let me go
ahead<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.310> show<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.700> inside<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.330> turn

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
ahead and show you the inside and turn

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.940 
ahead and show you the inside and turn
it<00:02:48.690> off<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:51.200> guitar<00:02:52.200> cable<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.769> has<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
it off a guitar cable just has a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.780 
it off a guitar cable just has a
positive<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.730> negative<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.810> ground

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
positive and negative so you just ground

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.729 
positive and negative so you just ground
let<00:02:56.790> me<00:02:56.909> just<00:02:57.780> keep<00:02:57.989> from<00:02:58.200> pulling<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.590> apart

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
let me just keep from pulling this apart

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.949 
let me just keep from pulling this apart
you<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.790> ground<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.299> guitar<00:03:00.660> don't<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.900> if

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
you just ground the guitar don't know if

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
you just ground the guitar don't know if
you<00:03:01.049> can<00:03:01.200> see<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.370> back<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.760> the

this part little and you just ground the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.490 
this part little and you just ground the
the<00:03:12.180> ground<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> guitar<00:03:13.049> cable<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.440> just

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
the ground of the guitar cable and just

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.289 
the ground of the guitar cable and just
start<00:03:13.799> touching<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.159> positive<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.790> t<00:03:15.000> hit<00:03:15.180> the

start touching the positive to t hit the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.720 
start touching the positive to t hit the
right<00:03:15.420> one<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:16.829> it<00:03:17.099> that's<00:03:17.489> all

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
a lot of stuff that I wasn't using just

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.140 
a lot of stuff that I wasn't using just
so<00:03:24.359> I<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.540> more<00:03:24.780> space<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.640> wasn't<00:03:26.910> so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
so I have more space and it wasn't so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.569 
so I have more space and it wasn't so
clogged<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.870> there<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:29.069> is<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> great

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
clogged up in there so this is a great

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.199 
clogged up in there so this is a great

clear setting and then I'm going to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.039 
clear setting and then I'm going to
overdrive<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.489> pull<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.540> microphone<00:04:00.750> a

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.870 
overdrive it and pull the microphone a
little<00:04:01.169> bit<00:04:01.410> back<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.099> volumes<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.669> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
little bit back so the volumes are the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.629 
little bit back so the volumes are the
same<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:04.049> then<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.709> overdrive<00:04:05.310> and

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
same but then that that overdrive and

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.789 
same but then that that overdrive and
that<00:04:06.239> clear<00:04:06.569> Bell<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.139> they'll<00:04:07.560> mix

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
that clear Bell like they'll mix

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.409 
that clear Bell like they'll mix
together<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.400> make<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.579> little<00:04:08.849> song<00:04:09.180> or

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
together and make a little song or

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.129 
together and make a little song or
something<00:04:09.660> mono

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
something mono

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.720 
something mono
