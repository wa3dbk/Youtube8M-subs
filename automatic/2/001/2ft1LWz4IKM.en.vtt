like that but we do as you can see back

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.009 
like that but we do as you can see back
here<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.429> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.699> we<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> baby<00:00:45.420> growing

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.829 
here as you know we have a baby growing
here<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.359> to<00:00:48.449> get<00:00:48.539> hit<00:00:48.719> by

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
here so I don't want it to get hit by

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.299 
here so I don't want it to get hit by
Frost<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.499> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.010> would<00:00:50.190> be

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
Frost because I don't think it would be

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
Frost because I don't think it would be
able<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.519> survive<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.999> because<00:00:51.269> it<00:00:51.510> doesn't

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
able to survive it because it doesn't

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.549 
able to survive it because it doesn't
have<00:00:51.809> any<00:00:52.370> any<00:00:53.370> tuber<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:54.839> corn<00:00:55.320> or

gonna take this in before it gets hit by

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.320 
gonna take this in before it gets hit by
Frost<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.370> is<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.730> that<00:01:05.940> might<00:01:06.120> end

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
Frost and this is the one that might end

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.010 
Frost and this is the one that might end
up<00:01:06.510> growing<00:01:06.780> through<00:01:08.240> next<00:01:09.240> year<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.690> me<00:01:09.810> I'll

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
up growing through next year for me I'll

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
up growing through next year for me I'll
see<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.440> this<00:01:10.620> one<00:01:10.830> does<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.340> might<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
see how this one does it might be a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
see how this one does it might be a
little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.940> too<00:01:12.150> big<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.570> maybe<00:01:12.660> I<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.990> give

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
little bit too big but maybe I can give

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.440 
little bit too big but maybe I can give
it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> friend<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> bigger<00:01:13.920> yard<00:01:14.450> we'll

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it to a friend with a bigger yard we'll

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.740 
it to a friend with a bigger yard we'll
see<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.840> goes<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> spring<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
see how that goes in the spring so but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.320 
see how that goes in the spring so but
right<00:01:18.900> now<00:01:19.080> I've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> pot<00:01:20.160> full<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.590> just<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
right now I've got a pot full of just a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.700 
right now I've got a pot full of just a
water<00:01:24.330> retentive<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> I'll<00:01:25.080> mix<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.440> one<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
water retentive so I'll mix this one is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.370 
water retentive so I'll mix this one is
the<00:01:26.570> Miracle<00:01:27.570> Grow<00:01:28.160> moisture<00:01:30.380> moisture

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the Miracle Grow moisture moisture

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940 
the Miracle Grow moisture moisture
something<00:01:31.950> uh-huh<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.420> generally<00:01:34.380> speaking<00:01:34.410> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
something uh-huh so generally speaking I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.500 
something uh-huh so generally speaking I
don't<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> stuff<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.910> most<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.450> my

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
don't use this stuff for most of my

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.330 
don't use this stuff for most of my
plants<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.410> does<00:01:37.590> retain<00:01:38.040> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
plants because it really does retain so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
plants because it really does retain so
much<00:01:38.520> moisture<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.530> things<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.950> these

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
much moisture but for things like these

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.650 
much moisture but for things like these
elephant<00:01:41.550> ears<00:01:41.760> or<00:01:44.030> bananas<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.300> something

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
elephant ears or bananas or something

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.340 
elephant ears or bananas or something
that<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:47.330> it<00:01:48.330> really<00:01:48.750> works<00:01:49.110> well

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that they really it really works well

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.610 
that they really it really works well
you<00:01:50.210> don't<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.390> water<00:01:51.600> every<00:01:51.750> five

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
you don't have to water every five

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.260 
you don't have to water every five
minutes<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.330> can<00:01:54.330> get<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.540> under<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.930> leaf

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
minutes I can get in under this leaf

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.430 
minutes I can get in under this leaf
there's<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.660> any<00:01:57.900> root<00:01:58.170> development

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
there's really not any root development

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.100 
there's really not any root development
yet<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.550> little<00:02:00.030> guy<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:00.900> gonna

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
yet on this little guy I'm just gonna

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.870 
yet on this little guy I'm just gonna
snip<00:02:01.470> off<00:02:01.650> its<00:02:01.890> little<00:02:02.130> umbilical<00:02:02.610> cord<00:02:02.820> here

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
snip off its little umbilical cord here

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.580 
snip off its little umbilical cord here
just<00:02:05.360> get<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.689> little<00:02:05.930> close<00:02:06.140> up<00:02:06.350> here<00:02:07.989> as<00:02:08.989> you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
just get a little close up here as you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.610 
just get a little close up here as you
can<00:02:09.770> see<00:02:09.970> maybe<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:12.020> where<00:02:12.170> was<00:02:12.319> attached

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
can see maybe this is where was attached

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.420 
can see maybe this is where was attached
to<00:02:12.770> a<00:02:12.890> plant

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
to a plant

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.259 
to a plant
there's<00:02:14.300> little<00:02:14.540> nubbins<00:02:14.870> here<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:17.060> think

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
there's little nubbins here so I think

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.320

grows<00:02:36.080> I'm<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> little<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.840> little<00:02:38.840> worried<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
grows I'm a little a little worried that

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.039 
grows I'm a little a little worried that
there<00:02:40.700> was<00:02:40.819> no<00:02:40.910> not<00:02:41.239> enough<00:02:41.450> root<00:02:41.630> growth<00:02:41.840> on

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
there was no not enough root growth on

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:42.309 
there was no not enough root growth on
it

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
it

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.750 
it
again<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.709> wanted<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.160> leave<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.519> there

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
again I wanted to leave it on there

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.089 
again I wanted to leave it on there
until<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.269> started<00:02:44.599> growing<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:45.049> its<00:02:45.200> own<00:02:45.349> in

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
until it started growing on its own in

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.089 
until it started growing on its own in
the<00:02:46.160> soil<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:47.530> unfortunately<00:02:48.530> frost<00:02:48.799> comes

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
the soil but unfortunately frost comes

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.030 
the soil but unfortunately frost comes
quickly<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:51.290> might<00:02:51.530> not<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:51.980> much

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
quickly and it might not have that much

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160 
quickly and it might not have that much
time<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.880> coming<00:02:53.060> into<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.420> warmth<00:02:53.690> it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
time so it's coming into the warmth it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.449 
time so it's coming into the warmth it
