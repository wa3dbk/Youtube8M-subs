00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080 
but this is really awesome for this I'm
using<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.440> piece<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.650> card<00:02:36.070> stock<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.610> liquid

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
using a piece of card stock and liquid

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.600 
using a piece of card stock and liquid
gilding<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:38.170> pencil<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.100> I'm<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.430> using

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
gilding and a pencil and I'm just using

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.810 
gilding and a pencil and I'm just using
the<00:02:39.820> eraser<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.630> make<00:02:40.750> polka<00:02:41.110> dots<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> got

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
the eraser to make polka dots so I got

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.220 
the eraser to make polka dots so I got
the<00:02:42.940> inspiration<00:02:43.240> from<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.720> background<00:02:44.140> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
the inspiration from the background of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.310 
the inspiration from the background of
my<00:02:44.260> computer<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.420> make<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:47.020> bunch

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
my computer and if you just make a bunch

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.980 
my computer and if you just make a bunch
of<00:02:47.440> polka<00:02:47.650> dots<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.160> put<00:02:48.250> them<00:02:48.400> randomly

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
of polka dots you can put them randomly

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.480 
of polka dots you can put them randomly
everywhere<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.320> then<00:02:50.950> you're<00:02:51.100> gonna<00:02:51.190> want<00:02:51.430> to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
everywhere and then you're gonna want to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.960 
everywhere and then you're gonna want to
let<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.820> dry<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.570> an<00:02:52.660> hour<00:02:53.640> after<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.790> you

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
let this dry for an hour after that you

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.090 
let this dry for an hour after that you
can<00:02:55.150> measure<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.780> against<00:02:56.320> your<00:02:56.530> frame<00:02:56.830> and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
can measure it up against your frame and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.280 
can measure it up against your frame and
cut<00:02:57.459> off<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.850> extra<00:02:58.240> so<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> fits<00:02:59.080> inside

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
cut off the extra so that it fits inside

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.380 
cut off the extra so that it fits inside
the<00:02:59.560> frame<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.070> then<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.090> place<00:03:01.360> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the frame and then you can just place it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.460 
the frame and then you can just place it
inside<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:02.850> close<00:03:03.850> it

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.820 

and<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.090> done<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.930> glass<00:03:09.170> works<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
and it is done the glass works as a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.440 
and it is done the glass works as a
whiteboard<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:11.000> write<00:03:11.180> things

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
whiteboard so you can just write things

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.570 
whiteboard so you can just write things
to<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.620> wrote<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.310> should

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
to do on it I wrote that you should

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.520 
to do on it I wrote that you should
thumbs<00:03:14.030> up<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.300> video<00:03:14.450> because<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.320> should

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
thumbs up this video because you should

thumbs up this video because you should
totally<00:03:15.800> do<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.310> right<00:03:16.490> now

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.870 

okay<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.260> really<00:03:24.440> easy<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.860> make<00:03:24.980> take

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
okay so this is really easy to make take

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.970 
okay so this is really easy to make take
some<00:03:26.240> painters<00:03:26.780> tape<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.290> just<00:03:27.380> place<00:03:27.950> it

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
into a square and then paint the inside

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.310 
into a square and then paint the inside
of<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.460> square<00:03:40.670> with<00:03:40.970> chalkboard<00:03:41.510> paint

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320
