00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 you never feel a little chef i don't have 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 no title in the kitchen but I have to 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.639
 admit that there are some recipes that 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 make me so happy to make me believe 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.240
 to be a real coca and between 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
 these happy recipes certainly can't 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 miss the crunchy octopus that I love 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.990
 and today I will propose you together with one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.380
 delicate sail always for today we see the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 recipe for preparing crispy octopus 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 with peppers we need to order 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 the main ingredient we have a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 kilo of octopus already boiled a clove 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.980
 of garlic a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 extra virgin a sprig of parsley 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 we have fresh peppers and sauce 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 400 g of peppers 30 thousand liters of milk 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.300
 salt and pepper just a tablespoon of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.969
 extra virgin olive oil optional for the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 accompanying frosting we have 5 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.350
 spoons of balsamic vinegar 10 grams of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 sugar 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.340
 the first thing to do is of course in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 clean and cook the octopus them 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.969
 overlay you can find the link 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.949
 of reference of the specific recipe 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.689
 however cleaning is relatively 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.119
 simple let's say I bought it 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.850
 thawed then I removed the roster 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.830
 therefore evident the clean from the eyes and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.350
 then I cooked them in water 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
 aromatic with a little carrot a little 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.380
 celery for 18 minutes by calculating 18 20 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 minutes per kg of octopus and then I have it 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 left to cool completely in the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 cooking liquid to soften 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 the meats and this is the result 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.310
 now we leave it aside 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 we dedicate to the accompanying cream 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.409
 that I chose with the peppers I 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.299
 cut the peppers after cleaning them 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.240
 then remorse internal filaments and i 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.729
 seeds cut into layers 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.620
 now we move to a little casserole 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.140
 let's go rosell with peppers 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.850
 I heated the saucepan I poured a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.520
 spoon of extra virgin olive oil not 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.520
 abound it is not necessary then we pour 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.680
 the peppers are browned for good then 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.590
 sustained flame for 2 3 minutes 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.000
 turning them over often for this stage then 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.070
 we can add salt and pepper to taste after 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 of which we will lower the plain e 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.240
 we will cook for another 10 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.580
 minutes until they become 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.800
 for the soft ones we are waiting for i 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.390
 peppers wither we do the 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.140
 glaze with balsamic vinegar 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 we are not in a small pan 45 in short 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.720
 spoons of balsamic vinegar therefore not 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.980
 be precise with the doses in this case 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.570
 we are also sugar a teaspoon 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.170
 we mix for good than in until 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.990
 dissolve 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.910
 let's raise the temperature a little bit 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.690
 we always continue to mix and now 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.960
 we will evaporate half the liquid up 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.910
 when we see that the vinegar begins 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.860
 to thicken ok then we will leave it 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.550
 intimidate and you will see you will be found with 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.550
 that relaxes 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.730
 after a few minutes of boiling you say 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
 that our senses are thickening 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.420
 slowly and well reduced 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.520
 now as I said before we leave it 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.590
 you will see them when the comes down 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.810
 temperature will also begin to thicken 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.480
 expect the peppers to be cooked not 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.980
 perfectly then we proceed 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.140
 we have thus finished cooking i 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.280
 peppers we tie and let cool and 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.850
 this result 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.350
 now we have to make a creamy sauce 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.710
 pour the peppers 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:49.570
 inside a mixer or better than a 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:54.790
 so becker then we add the milk e 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.070
 then my name is so we made the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.190
 our cream the peppers if you want you can 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.690
 also filters through a colander 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.050
 I keep it that way because I like it 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.140
 a bit lumpy what we miss now 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.470
 the realization of the crunchy octopus that 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.530
 it is nothing more than a sautÃ©ed octopus 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.260
 we put the whole port with the pieces 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.880
 that I had previously cut like this 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.980
 we can decide if it is Italian in pieces 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.880
 little ones or if you leave the beautiful ones 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.520
 tentacles 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.140
 I like long tentacles with le 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.510
 suckers if you don't like suction cups 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.250
 clearly take them off I do so i 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.070
 tentacles too long as in this one 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.320
 case we can also cut myself true if 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.660
 you do n't want it to be castor you can in 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.660
 use them with a toothpick and then 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.400
 proceed with browning but if instead 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.400
 be light a little don't mind 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.640
 here it is 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.849
 we are also cut off the head a lot more 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.730
 as you can see I also left the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.250
 skin if you don't like it 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.130
 Also in this case it removes them as well 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.990
 poured 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.100
 inside a pan I choose 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.470
 of the pans in stone that me 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.190
 they allow to use little fat 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.150
 I'm also flavoring oil with one 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.310
 clove of garlic in shirt and now 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.190
 that the oil and warm we can also 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:40.840
 brown in 80 strainers we use a couple of them 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.540
 of mutilated per side and then proceed the 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.880
 flame cooking for another 5 6 minutes 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:53.620
 however moderate 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:56.140
 we lower common and this is the octopus 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.420
 crunchy now let's proceed with 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.960
 the chin implant 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.030
 then I got an ok soup dish 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.600
 we put a base with the sauce ai 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.250
 heated peppers the first we do 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.550
 we also have a nice base 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.860
 more 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.860
 ok then his lawns we arrange in a group 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:42.930
 then what is a bit of parsley 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:46.230
 fresh above and our last touch 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.950
 class with balsamic vinegar and yes it is 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.950
 solidified 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.710
 our dish is me 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.840
 clearly veil served with a base of 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.420
 peppers, however, to make it even more 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.420
 delicate the senses 1 you can replace it 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.260
 with a potato-based sauce or 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.710
 also with peas 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.710
 enjoy your meal
