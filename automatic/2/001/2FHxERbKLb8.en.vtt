00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
of the way but I guess that's it we

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
of the way but I guess that's it we
tried<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.299> film<00:03:42.510> as<00:03:42.630> much<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:42.959> surgery<00:03:43.410> day<00:03:43.590> as

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.860 
tried to film as much as surgery day as
possible<00:03:43.890> but<00:03:44.370> they<00:03:44.549> wouldn't<00:03:45.390> really<00:03:45.450> let<00:03:45.720> us

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
possible but they wouldn't really let us

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.539 
possible but they wouldn't really let us
film<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.290> much<00:03:46.380> back<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.769> pre-op<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.400> stuff

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
film that much back in pre-op and stuff

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.860
