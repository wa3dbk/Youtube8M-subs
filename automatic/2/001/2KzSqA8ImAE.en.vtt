 the now is for 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.420
 already doing flights in three dimensions greater treasures 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.830
 the people in charge 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.840
 to take 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.080
 conceptual arts concepts and pass it will go to three dimensions 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.669
 the animators 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.000
 are the people 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.939
 who are responsible for giving life 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.840
 all the character models and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560
 Vehicles or objects created 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.609
 work promo 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.289
 the level designers are 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.510
 a team of people who are in charge 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.710
 to create the physical space over which the game will be developed 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.940
 i 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 they usually work within what is called a development engine of a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.740
 game yes 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.150
 and what were their levels 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.470
 and they take care of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.110
 see the bad ones with some of the objects created by the moderators 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.440
 the visual effects specialist tesia weighed more 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.640
 the person charged with what 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.940
 by sexes for example from 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 lightning use 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.890
 Explosion effects 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 iu in an amount of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.750
 d 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.350
 of special effects as they can be 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.540
 takes him to osaka oy 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600
 Olympic Village Mind 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.049
 the faith programmers are the ones who are responsible for integrating all the 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.280
 contents 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.450
 the design of the game 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 woo logic talk about 16 the game 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 i loave that also with some other 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.340
 with some other needs according to the platform 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.260
 in which the game is being developed 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.870
 and integrate poper to the east 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.060
 d multi integral player cooperations 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.009
 d choose certify if 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.009
 take quantity 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 and of technical problems as they are development are 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.310
 solution to his back to urinate the audio sectors people people who 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160
 they take care of 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.270
 produce 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.159
 two audio effects and the entire network and the soundtrack 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.039
 the whole part 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.849
 that has to do with the sound of the game 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.599
 the testes as already and materially people who are in charge of the pro 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.150
 the alpha and beta injuries of the software 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.879
 to debug errors and when you leave asobal market with full monster 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.769
 of 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.819
 I pass you 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.279
 ok problems 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.859
 game bugs 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.859
 content production 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.809
 p in fact the content 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.189
 we found a story one 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.979
 although there is not always, for example, the case of tetris 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.439
 that was a very very interesting game 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.169
 in his time then 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.540
 it was one of the best selling and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.540
 I did not have any locks just a fun villa game 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.259
 but then most of the games 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.639
 that nowadays they are selling that are competitive get press must 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.909
 put a story in a plot and the mess and they can depend on having a person 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.269
 expert in writing 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 toole in the history of and the development of the game 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.299
 the design but as we said earlier fishing by the lord of the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.679
 game and is based on two 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.809
 pose the rules of the game 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.009
 art design 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:24.229
 henson the conceptual arts of characters costumes decoration in 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:25.489
 vehicles 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.799
 graphics production 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.920
 from in it are produced graphics two and a half vetoes the 3d 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.569
 in English or they are called is country 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.069
 our expressed author of the method graphics that are integrated within 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.049
 of the show art 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.039
 of the video game 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.809
 the design of levels 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.809
 it is also an important part of content destruction 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:50.910
 the development of the whole set 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.679
 of all the sounds 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.319
 who has the game 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 the interface 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.710
 g oÃ­ means graphics and usher inter felisuco 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.629
 graphical user interface 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.629
 the interface by maya which he 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:12.340
 kellner good player then adequate or with figure his game 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.379
 in the action of 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.809
 on June 8 of the Senate 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.209
 jadad display 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.189
 sd es 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.669
 Those are the 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.830
 graphic elements that appears at the moment we are playing for example 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.870
 the life bar 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.659
 of a player oo of the map 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.659
 ercolini who adds father of tracking 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.610
 that you see in some interface of the monkey fires 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.430
 then all that requires a design 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 and all this comes this the toxic process the content 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.080
 programming 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 the programming has many details 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.860
 some of the most important ones as the construction of the rules of the game 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.889
 all artificial intelligence solutions 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.520
 among which are added to the coach 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.889
 of the problems his case is more important the Pope in bilbo 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.360
 oppression of roads 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.509
 of this from all sectors 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.960
 of all the characters that are that have 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.960
 characters or elements that should have 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.580
 a prediction 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.870
 fingers of a 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.870
 proper displacement for what 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.389
 seem to have life 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.340
 elche and well what if the solution of how they are going to see the materials course 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.229
 the sixth special spec 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.360
 the propagation of sound 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.280
 is very important because it allows you to create a user environment in three 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.599
 dimensions 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.289
 physical simulation 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.189
 allows to simulate fluid collisions 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.800
 explosions 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 allows simulate percent 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.889
 multiplayer platform 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.759
 then the public loan that players for what they do is develop 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.759
 games so that a 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.039
 a certain player connects with another English player standing up to all 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.389
 due use 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.529
 in day is certain if this data 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.080
 why then there is a 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.940
 an interaction between both players his multiplayer platform is one of 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.499
 the 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:27.889
 of those of the problems that most strongly attached sold that solves a 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.099
 a good schedule of a videogame online services nowadays 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.430
 with all the platforms etc are using online services you can 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.749
 important that the programming is taken into account 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.779
 an online service solution for the game
