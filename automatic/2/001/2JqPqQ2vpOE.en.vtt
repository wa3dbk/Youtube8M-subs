00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.430
 I am thijs and I am here at make-up 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.040
 that is a theater company in almere 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.200
 then spectacular show 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.970
 when i was as old as you i saw you 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.920
 for the first show and I found 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.290
 it fantastic 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.970
 and now I do an internship here 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.830
 I am very curious that this one 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.160
 make performances 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.910
 I am looking hi I am thijs hi I am 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.620
 arjen anchor 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 artistic director of viserys and if 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 Artistic leader 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.750
 I help to invent the show 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.290
 you don't do that just being there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 all kinds of smart nice people out there too 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.030
 help and the second thing you do is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 you try all disciplines together 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.870
 to be and disciplines 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.989
 For example, decorbouw or steered to make 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 or compose music or play 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 well how do they come back after we 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.520
 brainstorm about what we would all do 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.320
 can do and and of the important 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.510
 things to add is that we like to do something 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.990
 so current is what occupies people 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.220
 or 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.049
 likely to do in the future 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.979
 and the other is where it plays 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.240
 wondering 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.280
 that they are very important to us because we 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.689
 make visual come so the image 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.219
 what you see is therefore public 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.259
 important there must also be a lot of fun 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.180
 are or nice options or 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 so surprisingly have a surprise 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.439
 Which 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 Second where is it that can be men with 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.570
 the decor would do just that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.490
 important 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.500
 and is that what you made first yes there is 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090
 a model of the decor 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.939
 at least from a part of the performance 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 it also changes all those models 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.010
 so all those little trees and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.260
 roads and behind those little roads 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.750
 and in trees and under the grass, eh 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.590
 no in all kinds of places where special 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 effect is hidden 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.850
 but we don't just have a model 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.950
 with which we shape the performance 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.510
 there is also such a thing as a script script 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.020
 that is one 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.350
 well iphone so thick book you 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.730
 and in which not only all dialogues 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.820
 so what do people say to each other 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.020
 but also just described in what the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.790
 action is what people do 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.900
 want to get so also you do not have anything 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.610
 to say a moment 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 state the anyway and you walk to the right or 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.810
 and you get in a car or you disappear 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.810
 in a hatch or falls into the water 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.420
 then well that is even though a scrub 7x it 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 is a story about two brothers fat and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.380
 barryvan race and they have one 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.540
 successful business 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.500
 family business and that's called the van 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 cultured meat once was a butcher 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.709
 but now they grow meat without that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.150
 there still need to be animals for it 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.790
 sex 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.600
 this is really very secret work in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.610
 progress' that is nice, isn't it 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.040
 this is with my brother i play the role 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.870
 van bonnie van race am youngest brother 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.590
 fat my old farmer 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.510
 we have a family business in meat 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 it used to be that my 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.140
 great grandfather mine 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.070
 my grandfather who had a butcher 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.690
 row 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.000
 but we have that company bigger 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.880
 we are now a company in 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.820
 cultured meat cultured meat is a new one 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.000
 product no longer reaches a slaughterhouse 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.100
 pass 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.989
 no more animals are killed 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.680
 it is simply made in one 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.310
 laboratory 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.040
 avi 7 parts can't hurt 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.890
 put it handy for you or you 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.090
 head 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.760
 oui or not i play dick of race together 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 with barryvan race for mik the management 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.990
 of race racing meat 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.130
 and this company has except it 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.050
 cultured meat also a completely different one 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.010
 departments very important department 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.620
 I think 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.670
 limbs and organs is aging the world 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.620
 more 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.900
 limb organs that are 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.730
 spare parts anyone can quite one 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.489
 use the realization part 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.709
 and we can be ourselves in the long term like me 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.540
 the development continues by move also 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.880
 cloning you can not yet use the buttons 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.739
 sit down from life but then it is 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.880
 so old fashioned this is progress where i am 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.260
 I actually go machine 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.260
 why should I not clone myself 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.900
 when i get the brothers disagreement on 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.120
 the moment the oldest fat 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.820
 the colony itself starts out well 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.470
 the flight and adventurous spectacular 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.470
 flee into the future 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 it starts with reading the script 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.009
 and with the conversation with the director and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.009
 with the makers of visa vie 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.130
 and then I make a picture myself 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.349
 my head of the characters and do that 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.930
 for example through the 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.699
 modpodge that sees a wall hanging here 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.699
 so then I start looking for pictures 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.710
 magazines and in books and on the internet 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.810
 so that is really starting point and then 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.819
 I will make sketches then I really make 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.780
 costume designs 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.199
 and then start looking for the right one 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.430
 fabrics and then I go to him I have a team 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.190
 of seamstresses 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.449
 those costumes and going to perform I love 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.699
 sure it does if it is a bit 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.680
 separate is that it is not really from the real 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.750
 world comes that are not just clothes 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.810
 but that it is 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.670
 what fancy fancy dress costumes are 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.650
 and this performance we look there 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.280
 also really test that they are resting and 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.889
 that they can last for 2 years and 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.430
 because you play outside and it goes like this 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.920
 to rain 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.920
 so many things that matter to you 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.060
 work for almost 20 years now 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.950
 sound done and lightly played along 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.600
 and now again some phrases 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.400
 sound and tessa imagine that 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.790
 means I think where speakers 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.410
 how many speakers it is 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.280
 there are more than 30 in this case 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.560
 that means that during the 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.020
 show the music in a later effect 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.360
 sounds in start and because the text is 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.610
 in the show we are also channels 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.610
 and I care well for the actors 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.700
 I am you want of dish I do 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.220
 actually there is no coffee service 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.440
 set design so I am he a bit 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.700
 the point of contact how things look 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 finally come out 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.840
 and together with the direction with the players 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.400
 look at what it can do 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.780
 there is a lot of technology in advice or you 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.300
 always do a lot with technology 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.680
 well to make crazy effect and there 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.320
 he actually becomes design like it 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.850
 ware with the jacket cast around 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.000
 you have a desk logical to none of 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.530
 those performances and then comes the 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.020
 second part to the second part 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.460
 shifts on a big band hope very 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.760
 spectacular with a lot seen until now 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.860
 So far then you look inside park 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.480
 whole show exist we have one 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.800
 large part 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.629
 visual effects 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.039
 the child must not include films and years 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.199
 theater 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.819
 we try that out do each tom 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.009
 to get people think that this is bro 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.720
 may you live to just sit 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.919
 watching everything in the film can be paper here 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.919
 actually as much to 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:26.130
 now it is still a big chaos here 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:29.130
 but later when you are here 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:33.840
 then there is a great prince here 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:36.199
 he owes me here lisa anyway 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.199
 please
