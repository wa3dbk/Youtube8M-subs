the mud battle staff and the sirico

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
the mud battle staff and the sirico

Kings so I got the D hatchet we did stay
for<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.149> believe<00:01:45.630> three<00:01:45.990> hours<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.710> roughly

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
for I believe three hours it was roughly

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.550 
for I believe three hours it was roughly
30<00:01:47.250> 06<00:01:47.549> /<00:01:47.939> Laplace<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.380> three

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
30 06 / Laplace so you know about three

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170 
30 06 / Laplace so you know about three
hours<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.369> count<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> time

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
hours but then you got it count the time

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
hours but then you got it count the time
that<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.450> took<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> run<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that it took to run there because the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
that it took to run there because the
guy<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.640> going<00:01:53.909> what's<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.270> lost<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.840> it

guy was going what's got lost and it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
guy was going what's got lost and it
took<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> while<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.090> Dagon<00:01:57.390> off

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
without really suck because that would

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.449
