00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.340
 and hello friends with you china burns and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.860
 Today I will complain to you 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 chinese power bank from xiaomi why 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.210
 just complain because I'm him 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 got and as always me and asked him 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.219
 try that is like me and the previous one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.869
 put on my battery I charged you 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.600
 completely then several phones 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 that is, one phone charged 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 then charged another phone well, and so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 Makar could determine though 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 Approximately the capacity of this battery is stated 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 10,000 400 times now with me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.980
 maximum is the maximum that I could squeeze it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 with him six half tyra 7000 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.679
 Milliamper hours that is, on the ceiling 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.499
 and now I have a doubt that 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.479
 concerns its originality of course 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.149
 the seller swears there that he 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.159
 it is the original but I doubt something 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.360
 I'll tell you now 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.900
 subscribers said the original should 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.110
 be here the same as mine 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.409
 such a piece of paper then some kind of cardboard 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.229
 maybe it's cardboard on them so damn well 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.210
 judging by this already original yes but we go 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.250
 farther 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.649
 unpack it beautifully everything we have 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.240
 here there is an instruction here 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.880
 I think everything is a sign of how it works 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.890
 so here we are going to charge 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.039
 the reverse side will charge themselves 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.000
 phones and tanks then another dodge here you are 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.770
 what do friends say firstly it's easy 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 secondly he's some kind of empty inside me 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.039
 so it seems here is a very bad build then 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.530
 there is a backlash and here it is pressed 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.869
 cracks if you click it a little bit here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 sticks out here a little bit dented from this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.020
 hand, I do not know may still need 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.439
 can we take one more 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.490
 it may be like here everything seems to be 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:15.210
 the original damn there is still a logo 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.519
 are present but I don't know about charging 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.349
 he is also pretty fast i mean he 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.090
 should charge for a long time from usually 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.950
 Charging which I have 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.739
 Ampere gives it charges where there is well 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.030
 probably not to cheat for three hours 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.290
 half seems to me for ten thousand 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 four hundred it should charge more 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.890
 but plus of course he gives less 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.599
 what should he when he should charge 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.510
 if you even take two phone batteries 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.360
 and a half of two thousand 500 milliamps 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.129
 hours must charge 4 phones and with 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.640
 pennies should still be enough there on 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.209
 someone's 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 but he doesn't charge it all he understand 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.069
 charges a maximum of almost 3 like this 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.019
 Well, no matter how I want to say that 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.519
 I was the original I just do not know what 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.579
 do here too vitya on the edge 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.400
 furnished here on the buttons like lit up 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.250
 all as it should be on the elevator note thiago 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 center i'm pushing back and forth his god 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.930
 knows mean I got caught 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.579

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.290
 assembly I am right upset do not know okay 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:31.200
