as you can see there's some little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.809 
as you can see there's some little
carabiner<00:01:17.549> or<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.119> rope<00:01:18.389> pulls<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.549> all<00:01:20.549> four

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
carabiner or like rope pulls on all four

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:29.989 
carabiner or like rope pulls on all four
sides<00:01:21.469> two<00:01:25.340> three<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.469> four<00:01:28.469> right<00:01:28.649> there<00:01:28.999> and

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
sides two three and four right there and

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.349 
sides two three and four right there and
then<00:01:31.159> you<00:01:32.159> guys<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.849> we<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
then you guys can see we have like a

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.589 
then you guys can see we have like a
pulley<00:01:33.659> system<00:01:33.889> and<00:01:34.889> what<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.389> things<00:01:36.389> when

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
pulley system and what we do things when

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.209 
pulley system and what we do things when
we<00:01:36.719> need<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.929> store<00:01:37.109> this<00:01:37.200> thing<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
we need to store this thing we just

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.669 
we need to store this thing we just
attach<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.359> then<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.899> pull<00:01:40.169> those<00:01:40.349> ropes

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
attach this and then we pull those ropes

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.819 
attach this and then we pull those ropes
up<00:01:40.919> and<00:01:41.279> it<00:01:41.609> literally<00:01:42.179> like<00:01:42.539> lifts<00:01:42.959> up<00:01:43.139> into

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
up and it literally like lifts up into

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.349 
up and it literally like lifts up into
our<00:01:43.950> attic<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.999> it's<00:01:45.149> better<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.569> storage<00:01:47.359> now

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
our attic so it's better for storage now

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.749 
our attic so it's better for storage now
as<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.719> see<00:01:48.779> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.109> sides<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:50.340> made<00:01:50.549> our

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
as you can see on the sides we made our

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.409 
as you can see on the sides we made our
little<00:01:51.090> switches<00:01:52.969> stuff<00:01:54.169> and<00:01:55.789> then<00:01:56.789> this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.389> a

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:57.419 
little switches stuff and then this is a

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:59.479 
little switches stuff and then this is a
surprise<00:01:57.749> for<00:01:58.380> later<00:01:58.679> I'll<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.279> give<00:01:59.459> you

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
surprise for later I'll just give you

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.989 
surprise for later I'll just give you
one<00:01:59.579> hint<00:02:00.169> it<00:02:01.169> has<00:02:01.319> to<00:02:01.469> do<00:02:01.590> with<00:02:01.799> DCC<00:02:02.309> but<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
one hint it has to do with DCC but it is

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.190 
one hint it has to do with DCC but it is
not<00:02:03.239> DCC<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> that's<00:02:06.389> it's<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.929> hard<00:02:07.139> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
not DCC so that's it's kind of hard to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.490 
not DCC so that's it's kind of hard to
understand<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.450> it'll<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.720> cool<00:02:10.020> once

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
understand but it'll be really cool once

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
understand but it'll be really cool once
you<00:02:10.969> once<00:02:11.969> you<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.299> that<00:02:12.420> working<00:02:13.909> then<00:02:14.909> again

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you once you get that working then again

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.640 
you once you get that working then again
there's<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.840> inside

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.710 

got<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.980> our<00:02:20.040> tunnel<00:02:20.400> portals<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.300> in

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
got all of our tunnel portals all in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.620 
got all of our tunnel portals all in
place<00:02:22.790> three<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.360> there's<00:02:24.570> another

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
place three and then there's another

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.590 
place three and then there's another
tunnel<00:02:25.020> portal<00:02:25.500> right<00:02:25.680> around<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.600> but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
tunnel portal right around there but

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.120 
tunnel portal right around there but
we're<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.020> try<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.350> get<00:02:28.500> most<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
we're going to try and get most of the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.750 
we're going to try and get most of the
other<00:02:29.250> stuff<00:02:29.580> done<00:02:29.820> today<00:02:31.310> most<00:02:32.310> applied<00:02:32.610> to
