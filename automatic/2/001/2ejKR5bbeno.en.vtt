00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 photos of new hem hood asus s200 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.650
 I showed them officially is here such here 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.320
 modelki they are very simple such here 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 feeling threw somewhere went got like 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 as a tablet only a laptop in general, like 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.230
 I need a cloud device 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
 she is very simple she is available i am here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.359
 example model c200 will cost from 250 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.949
 dollars is a little c300 will probably 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.780
 a little bit on the way yet cost 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.100
 no what is this model 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 let's see what she has here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 There is also a yusbi 30 and a card reader and a connector for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.610
 headset connection is with dima if 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.239
 you need to display an image on a large 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.879
 the screen is usb 2 0 and there is a connector for sim 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.489
 maps and if you need to work in the city 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.199
 you can put 3g here and make 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 does it work using mobile networks 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.410
 No, of course , no one cooling all this 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 because it runs on a processor base 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 new intel bay trail m namely here 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.390
 quad celeron and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.740
 display with 10 models c 211 and 6-inch with 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.190
 hd resolution 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.410
 not 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.730
 touch panel ie use 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.860
 can only be through then which 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.900
 By the way , the keyboard is also very convenient . 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 keyboard despite enough strength 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.480
 cheap product quality 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.610
 the keyboard is quite good don't bend over 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.630
 least island type 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 I think it will be convenient to use 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.050
 also there is the same camera for 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 video calls in general everything seems to me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.860
 what area do we need a product go 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.330
 farther here we have in two colors 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.270
 model c300 presented 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 there is a white with a red cap and there is 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.260
 such here 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.960
 the man is completely black looks 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.690
 by the way is much more interesting than c200 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.840
 This is 13 3 inches and the models are also hd 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.480
 permissions are also no sensor on 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490
 it can probably have a display but models 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.320
 for the money it simply could not be 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.110
 would be here the same processor in both 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.240
 models can be equipped with two 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.500
 gigabytes of ram and 16 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.390
 GB of internal memory 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.190
 but also maybe i version with four 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 gigabytes in the socket cunning and two 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 Chromebook c200 c300 on computex 2014 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.590
