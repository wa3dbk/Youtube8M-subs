distributed<00:04:59.210> around<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.260> container<00:05:07.930> so

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
distributed around the container so

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
distributed around the container so
that's<00:05:09.470> what<00:05:09.860> it<00:05:09.980> would<00:05:10.070> look<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:11.800> when<00:05:12.800> you
