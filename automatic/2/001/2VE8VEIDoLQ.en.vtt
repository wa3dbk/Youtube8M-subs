00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
take a look at those zebras let's pan

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.080 
take a look at those zebras let's pan
the<00:00:35.649> camera<00:00:36.040> so<00:00:36.220> everybody<00:00:36.520> can<00:00:36.579> see<00:00:36.790> where<00:00:37.000> to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
the camera so everybody can see where to

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.120 
the camera so everybody can see where to
access<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:37.840> side<00:00:38.079> of<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.440> c100

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
access that on the side of the c100

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.069 
access that on the side of the c100
you'll<00:00:39.280> see<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.460> dedicated<00:00:39.790> zebra<00:00:40.570> button<00:00:40.870> and

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
you'll see a dedicated zebra button and

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.890 
you'll see a dedicated zebra button and
when<00:00:41.950> we<00:00:42.070> activate<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:43.120> default<00:00:43.510> zebra

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
when we activate that the default zebra

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.980 
when we activate that the default zebra
is<00:00:43.990> set<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.350> 70<00:00:44.800> plus<00:00:45.070> -5<00:00:45.580> so<00:00:46.540> when<00:00:46.720> we<00:00:46.810> get

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
is set to 70 plus -5 so when we get

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.310 
is set to 70 plus -5 so when we get
around<00:00:47.110> 70%<00:00:47.860> we<00:00:48.460> start<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.880> see<00:00:49.150> zebra<00:00:49.840> show<00:00:50.080> up

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
around 70% we start to see zebra show up

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.670 
around 70% we start to see zebra show up
this<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.340> really<00:00:51.880> great<00:00:52.120> for<00:00:52.470> highlights<00:00:53.470> so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
this is really great for highlights so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.870 
this is really great for highlights so
let's<00:00:53.830> go<00:00:53.920> ahead<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.100> open<00:00:54.250> up<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.670> camera

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
let's go ahead and open up the camera

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.819 
let's go ahead and open up the camera
here<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.329> you<00:00:55.570> can<00:00:55.690> start<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.079> see<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.560> and

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
here and you can start to see that and

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.280 
here and you can start to see that and
the<00:00:57.250> highlight<00:00:57.700> areas<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.360> course<00:00:58.810> not<00:00:59.050> just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
the highlight areas of course not just

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.800 
the highlight areas of course not just
for<00:00:59.500> skin<00:00:59.740> tone<00:01:00.010> but<00:01:00.310> also<00:01:00.550> for<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.690> know

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
for skin tone but also for you know

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.120 
for skin tone but also for you know
other<00:01:02.020> things<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.470> are<00:01:02.590> showing<00:01:02.860> up<00:01:02.950> in<00:01:03.040> the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
other things that are showing up in the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.460 
other things that are showing up in the
frame<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.610> there<00:01:04.150> are<00:01:04.329> ways<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.869> go<00:01:05.019> into<00:01:05.379> your

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
frame and there are ways to go into your

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.140 
frame and there are ways to go into your
menu<00:01:05.619> system<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.280> set<00:01:06.460> your<00:01:06.579> zebras<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.119> a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
menu system and set your zebras to a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.940 
menu system and set your zebras to a
hundred<00:01:07.540> percent<00:01:07.689> or<00:01:08.170> something<00:01:08.560> other<00:01:08.710> than

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
hundred percent or something other than

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.580 
hundred percent or something other than
that<00:01:09.189> but<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:09.790> think<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.630> with<00:01:10.930> this<00:01:11.140> camera

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
that but I think that with this camera

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.139 
that but I think that with this camera
system<00:01:11.770> because<00:01:12.250> we<00:01:12.369> have<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.549> waveform

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
system because we have a waveform

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.390 
system because we have a waveform
monitor<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:14.200> can<00:01:14.229> really<00:01:14.770> use<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.010> waveform

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
monitor you can really use that waveform

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.660 
monitor you can really use that waveform
monitor<00:01:16.120> as<00:01:16.300> your<00:01:16.510> overall<00:01:16.690> exposure<00:01:17.670> tool

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
monitor as your overall exposure tool

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.670 
monitor as your overall exposure tool
and<00:01:19.060> then<00:01:19.270> we<00:01:19.390> can<00:01:19.540> use<00:01:19.690> zebras<00:01:20.170> just<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.530> make

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and then we can use zebras just to make

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.899 
and then we can use zebras just to make
sure<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:21.070> we're<00:01:21.220> not<00:01:21.250> clipping<00:01:21.790> and

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
sure that we're not clipping and

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.610 
sure that we're not clipping and
highlights<00:01:22.330> for<00:01:22.540> things<00:01:22.750> like<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
highlights for things like this so a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.170 
highlights for things like this so a
great<00:01:23.920> tool<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.190> have<00:01:24.490> let's<00:01:24.880> go<00:01:24.970> ahead<00:01:25.030> and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
great tool to have let's go ahead and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.630 
great tool to have let's go ahead and
turn<00:01:25.300> off<00:01:25.360> zebras<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:27.280> we're<00:01:27.460> going<00:01:27.549> to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
turn off zebras and now we're going to

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.700 
turn off zebras and now we're going to
talk<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.909> little<00:01:28.150> bit<00:01:28.420> about<00:01:28.450> peaking<00:01:29.350> now

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
talk a little bit about peaking now

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.320 
talk a little bit about peaking now
we're<00:01:30.010> going<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.159> go<00:01:30.340> into<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.580> menu<00:01:30.940> system

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
we're going to go into a menu system

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.840 
we're going to go into a menu system
here<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.110> we<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.350> take<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.560> look<00:01:32.799> at<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.130> if<00:01:33.400> we

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
here so we can take a look at that if we

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.240 
here so we can take a look at that if we
press<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.120> menu<00:01:34.570> button<00:01:34.600> on<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.200> camera<00:01:35.680> we

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
press the menu button on the camera we

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.570 
press the menu button on the camera we
can<00:01:36.430> go<00:01:36.580> into<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.210> LCD<00:01:37.840> VF<00:01:38.680> or<00:01:38.890> viewfinder

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.940 
section we're going to go to peaking 1
which<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.540> default<00:01:46.810> for<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.350> camera<00:01:47.860> and

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
which is the default for the camera and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.950 
which is the default for the camera and
you<00:01:48.430> can<00:01:48.580> see<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:48.909> when<00:01:49.060> we<00:01:49.150> go<00:01:49.330> in<00:01:49.510> there<00:01:49.720> we

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
you can see that when we go in there we

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960 
you can see that when we go in there we
can<00:01:50.140> actually<00:01:50.470> change<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.040> color<00:01:51.070> which<00:01:51.760> by

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
can actually change the color which by

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.450 
can actually change the color which by
default<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:52.570> red<00:01:52.900> let's<00:01:53.860> go<00:01:53.979> ahead<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.250> change

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
default is red let's go ahead and change

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.100 
default is red let's go ahead and change
it<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.700> yellow<00:01:54.850> for<00:01:55.150> now<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.600> you'll<00:01:55.720> also<00:01:55.930> see

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
it to yellow for now and you'll also see

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.130 
it to yellow for now and you'll also see
that<00:01:56.290> we<00:01:56.470> can<00:01:56.710> change<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.430> gain<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.180> we<00:01:58.990> can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
that we can change the gain and we can

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.050 
that we can change the gain and we can
change<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.560> frequency<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.400> peaking

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
change the frequency of that peaking

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.539 
change the frequency of that peaking
will<00:02:01.720> step<00:02:01.990> out<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:02.830> go<00:02:03.070> back<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.460> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
will step out of that and go back to the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.090 
will step out of that and go back to the
regular<00:02:03.729> display<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.200> let's<00:02:05.439> go<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.979> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
regular display and then let's go to the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.140 
regular display and then let's go to the
side<00:02:06.400> of<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.700> camera

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
side of the camera

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.179 
side of the camera
in<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.570> same<00:02:07.810> area<00:02:08.170> where<00:02:08.319> we<00:02:08.470> found<00:02:08.709> the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.189 
in the same area where we found the

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.130 
in the same area where we found the
zebra<00:02:09.670> button<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.149> you'll<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.659> that<00:02:10.929> there's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
zebra button and you'll see that there's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.899 
zebra button and you'll see that there's
a<00:02:11.200> dedicated<00:02:11.620> peaking<00:02:12.129> button<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.670> we'll

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
a dedicated peaking button and we'll

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.360 
a dedicated peaking button and we'll
press<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.689> will<00:02:13.840> activate<00:02:14.290> peaking<00:02:14.950> so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
press that that will activate peaking so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.589 
press that that will activate peaking so
let's<00:02:15.519> go<00:02:15.610> ahead<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.879> throw<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> out<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.299> focus

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
let's go ahead and throw it out of focus

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.449 
let's go ahead and throw it out of focus
right<00:02:16.959> now<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.379> we'll<00:02:17.470> take<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.680> look<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.129> how

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
right now and we'll take a look at how

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.640 
right now and we'll take a look at how
that<00:02:18.519> peaking<00:02:19.120> works<00:02:19.419> and<00:02:19.749> then<00:02:20.319> we'll<00:02:20.469> come

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
that peaking works and then we'll come

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.000 
that peaking works and then we'll come
into<00:02:20.950> focus

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.440 

okay<00:02:25.010> cool<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.550> then<00:02:25.790> let's<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.090> go<00:02:26.240> out<00:02:26.420> of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
okay cool and then let's just go out of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
okay cool and then let's just go out of
focus<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.900> little<00:02:26.990> bit<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.440> other<00:02:27.560> way<00:02:27.740> just<00:02:28.220> so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
focus a little bit the other way just so

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.770 
focus a little bit the other way just so
that<00:02:28.459> people<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:28.940> what's<00:02:29.150> happening<00:02:29.630> as

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
that people can see what's happening as

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.800 
that people can see what's happening as
you're<00:02:30.319> coming<00:02:30.650> into<00:02:30.860> focus<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.790> then<00:02:32.660> as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you're coming into focus and then as

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
you're coming into focus and then as
soon<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.530> tack<00:02:33.800> sharp<00:02:34.100> you'll<00:02:34.280> see<00:02:34.490> it's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
soon as it's tack sharp you'll see it's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.490 
soon as it's tack sharp you'll see it's
actually<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.930> looking<00:02:36.230> at<00:02:36.319> those

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
actually going and it's looking at those

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.680 
actually going and it's looking at those
higher<00:02:36.709> contrast<00:02:37.280> areas<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.360> should<00:02:38.569> be

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
higher contrast areas and we should be

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.559 
higher contrast areas and we should be
tack<00:02:38.959> sharp<00:02:39.260> now<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.790> peaking

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
tack sharp now and that is the peaking

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.030 
tack sharp now and that is the peaking
feature<00:02:41.810> let's<00:02:42.110> go<00:02:42.230> ahead<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.560> turn<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.980> off

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
feature let's go ahead and turn that off

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360 
feature let's go ahead and turn that off
now<00:02:43.520> on<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.850> camera<00:02:44.180> system<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.250> we're<00:02:46.250> going

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
now on the camera system and we're going

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.800 
now on the camera system and we're going
to<00:02:46.459> take<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.610> look<00:02:46.790> at<00:02:46.850> another<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.450> which<00:02:47.780> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to take a look at another one which is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.479 
to take a look at another one which is
called<00:02:48.140> edge<00:02:48.440> monitor<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.069> this<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.310> pretty

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
called edge monitor and this is pretty

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.660 
called edge monitor and this is pretty
cool<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.170> activated<00:02:52.040> by<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.520> to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
cool it's actually activated by going to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.850 
cool it's actually activated by going to
the<00:02:52.790> waveform<00:02:53.450> button<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.170> side<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.709> let's

it the second time it will activate the
edge<00:03:02.840> monitor<00:03:03.440> and<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.250> really<00:03:04.519> cool<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
edge monitor and this is really cool the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.540 
edge monitor and this is really cool the
default<00:03:05.900> version<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.500> this<00:03:06.680> you'll<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.040> three

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
default version of this you'll see three

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.940 
default version of this you'll see three
red<00:03:07.580> boxes<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.600> then<00:03:09.080> let's<00:03:09.319> go<00:03:09.440> out<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.650> focus

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
red boxes and then let's go out of focus

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.430 
red boxes and then let's go out of focus
and<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.150> start<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.630> come<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.230> focus

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and then as we start to come in to focus

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.620 
and then as we start to come in to focus
on<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:13.250> subject<00:03:13.489> or<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:13.940> object<00:03:14.060> you're

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
on the subject or the object you're

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.420 
on the subject or the object you're
trying<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.959> focus<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.470> you'll<00:03:15.980> start<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.400> see

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
trying to focus on you'll start to see

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.400 
trying to focus on you'll start to see
that<00:03:16.790> green<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.480> it'll<00:03:17.569> start<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.870> increase

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
that green and it'll start to increase

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.040 
that green and it'll start to increase
and<00:03:18.739> then<00:03:19.340> just<00:03:19.880> start<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.300> go<00:03:20.420> just<00:03:20.690> slowly

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
and then just start to go just slowly

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.960 
and then just start to go just slowly
out<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.410> focus<00:03:21.739> again<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.430> can<00:03:22.459> see<00:03:22.760> what

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
out of focus again so we can see what

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.090 
out of focus again so we can see what
starts<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.360> happen<00:03:23.450> with<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.350> then<00:03:24.860> back

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
starts to happen with that and then back

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.270 
starts to happen with that and then back
into<00:03:25.580> focus<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> very<00:03:26.630> very<00:03:26.930> cool<00:03:27.200> tool<00:03:27.530> you

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
into focus so a very very cool tool you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.819 
into focus so a very very cool tool you
know<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.880> use<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.329> tool<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.260> need<00:03:30.290> that

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
know you use the tool that you need that

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.890 
know you use the tool that you need that
works<00:03:31.130> for<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.700> when<00:03:32.209> you're<00:03:32.390> using<00:03:32.630> the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
works for you when you're using the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410 
works for you when you're using the
camera<00:03:33.110> system<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.310> let's<00:03:34.519> go<00:03:34.640> ahead<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.120> turn

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
camera system so let's go ahead and turn

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.380 
camera system so let's go ahead and turn
off<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:36.110> edge<00:03:36.230> monitor<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.970> now<00:03:38.150> we're<00:03:38.299> going

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
off the edge monitor so now we're going

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.150 
off the edge monitor so now we're going
to<00:03:38.480> use<00:03:38.600> one<00:03:38.780> of<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.900> most<00:03:39.079> commonly<00:03:39.650> use<00:03:39.890> view

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
to use one of the most commonly use view

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.400 
to use one of the most commonly use view
assist<00:03:40.430> tools<00:03:40.700> which<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.090> magnification<00:03:41.570> we

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
assist tools which is magnification we

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.289 
assist tools which is magnification we
can<00:03:42.560> access<00:03:42.950> that<00:03:43.160> in<00:03:43.370> two<00:03:43.670> ways<00:03:43.970> on<00:03:44.180> the

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
can access that in two ways on the

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.440 
can access that in two ways on the
camera<00:03:44.630> system<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.650> side<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.130> camera

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
camera system on the side of the camera

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.330 
camera system on the side of the camera
button<00:03:47.450> number<00:03:47.690> eight<00:03:47.989> we<00:03:48.950> can<00:03:49.070> press<00:03:49.310> that

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
button number eight we can press that

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.670 
button number eight we can press that
and<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.060> will<00:03:50.209> activate<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.870> or<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.500> can

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and that will activate it or you can

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.710 
and that will activate it or you can
also<00:03:51.950> activate<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.730> on<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.030> grip<00:03:53.239> unit<00:03:53.600> in

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
also activate it on the grip unit in

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.930 
also activate it on the grip unit in
fact<00:03:53.900> most<00:03:54.200> people<00:03:54.500> probably<00:03:54.709> will<00:03:55.220> okay<00:03:55.880> so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
fact most people probably will okay so

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.550 
fact most people probably will okay so
now<00:03:56.180> I'm<00:03:56.269> going<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.570> Peter<00:03:56.810> press<00:03:57.290> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
now I'm going to have Peter press the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.800 
now I'm going to have Peter press the
magnified<00:03:58.070> button<00:03:58.430> on<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:59.000> grip<00:03:59.239> unit<00:03:59.660> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
magnified button on the grip unit and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.650 
magnified button on the grip unit and
that<00:03:59.840> will<00:04:00.290> activate<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:02.299> soon<00:04:02.359> as

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
that will activate that and as soon as

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.360 
that will activate that and as soon as
that<00:04:02.810> happens<00:04:03.320> we're<00:04:03.590> going<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.769> see<00:04:04.010> actually

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
that happens we're going to see actually

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.990 
that happens we're going to see actually
three<00:04:05.239> things<00:04:05.570> occur<00:04:05.989> by<00:04:06.859> default<00:04:07.549> we<00:04:07.850> would

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
three things occur by default we would

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.970 
three things occur by default we would
normally<00:04:08.359> just<00:04:08.390> see<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.930> magnification<00:04:09.530> of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
normally just see a magnification of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.000 
normally just see a magnification of
approximately<00:04:10.549> 2x<00:04:11.090> on<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.810> camera<00:04:12.290> but<00:04:12.829> we've

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
approximately 2x on the camera but we've

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.099 
approximately 2x on the camera but we've
gone<00:04:13.220> into<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.640> other<00:04:13.790> functions<00:04:14.329> menu<00:04:14.720> and

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
gone into the other functions menu and

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.319 
gone into the other functions menu and
under<00:04:16.039> there<00:04:16.340> we've<00:04:16.489> gone<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.850> custom

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
under there we've gone to the custom

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.180 
under there we've gone to the custom
function<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:18.019> we<00:04:18.380> actually<00:04:18.650> cover<00:04:18.859> this<00:04:19.039> in

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
function and we actually cover this in

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.640 
function and we actually cover this in
another<00:04:19.280> video<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.329> series<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.900> we<00:04:21.500> have

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
another video in the series and we have

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.909 
another video in the series and we have
added<00:04:22.240> peaking<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.419> we've<00:04:23.900> also<00:04:24.110> added<00:04:24.289> black

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
added peaking and we've also added black

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.710 
added peaking and we've also added black
and<00:04:25.160> white<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.669> image<00:04:26.120> which<00:04:26.330> makes<00:04:26.360> it

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
and white to that image which makes it

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.719 
and white to that image which makes it
even<00:04:26.900> easier<00:04:27.289> for<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.919> get<00:04:28.250> critical

even easier for you to get critical

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.640 
even easier for you to get critical
focus<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.539> can<00:04:29.720> use<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.080> feature<00:04:30.320> when
