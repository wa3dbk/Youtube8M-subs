00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
when we went they went through the

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.580 
when we went they went through the
scrapping<00:01:07.579> process<00:01:08.150> maybe<00:01:08.869> burned<00:01:09.439> it<00:01:09.560> a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
scrapping process maybe burned it a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.240 
scrapping process maybe burned it a
little<00:01:09.799> bit<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.280> know<00:01:10.630> from<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.470> they

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
little bit you know from that that they

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.859 
little bit you know from that that they
have<00:01:13.460> special<00:01:14.240> alloys<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.880> scammers<00:01:17.450> had

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
have special alloys so the scammers had

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.530 
have special alloys so the scammers had
mixed<00:01:18.259> real<00:01:18.829> gold<00:01:19.159> bullion<00:01:19.670> with<00:01:19.909> some<00:01:20.090> alloys

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
mixed real gold bullion with some alloys

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.219 
mixed real gold bullion with some alloys
and<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.710> when<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.850> jeweler<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.570> testing<00:01:24.079> it

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
and and when a jeweler is testing it

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.510 
and and when a jeweler is testing it
they<00:01:24.380> might<00:01:24.530> scrape<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.189> then<00:01:25.280> burn<00:01:25.490> it

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
they might scrape it and then burn it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.880 
they might scrape it and then burn it
mm-hmm<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.899> color<00:01:27.290> changes<00:01:27.770> they

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
mm-hmm and if the color changes they

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.770 
mm-hmm and if the color changes they
know<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:28.189> fake<00:01:28.399> gold<00:01:28.610> right<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.540> alloy

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
know it's fake gold right and the alloy

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.649 
know it's fake gold right and the alloy
didn't<00:01:30.110> change<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.340> alloy<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> fake

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
didn't change so the alloy in the fake

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.389 
didn't change so the alloy in the fake
gold<00:01:32.869> didn't<00:01:33.290> change<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.189> think<00:01:34.219> this

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
gold didn't change so do you think this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.260 
gold didn't change so do you think this
was<00:01:34.610> very<00:01:35.600> sophisticated<00:01:36.640> work<00:01:37.640> using<00:01:38.090> very
