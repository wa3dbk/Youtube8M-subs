00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.860
 Of course that does our weather 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.260
 mobile just fine if the whole winter 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.610
 bears get away now comes naturally time 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.010
 the car for the warm season 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.900
 to prepare for what you should pay attention to 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.330
 that's what we're all about together today 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.770
 a servus the weather on servus tv 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.770
 but now in the washing street 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.059
 Today we are on the Lake Constance on the way 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.980
 lies exactly between three countries namely 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.350
 Germany of Switzerland and Austria 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.870
 and we are in baden wÃ¼rttemberg in 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.210
 hagnau on Lake Constance you have to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 imagine there bodensees in the east west 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.699
 axis 65 kilometers wide and also 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.210
 quite deep in some cases up to 250 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.190
 meters 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.050
 So that's an incredibly huge one 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.580
 the amount of water that can get 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.729
 seasonal temperature fluctuations 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.159
 just adjust very slowly 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.020
 that means in the winter this is now 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.000
 heat storage in the surrounding area 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.729
 This will make regions a bit warmer 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 So right on the lake and in summer there's 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.970
 the lake at high heat from the water 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.800
 It is said to be very difficult 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.539
 also here in the surrounding regions 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.929
 This is called the Bodensee 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.929
 climate 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.860
 Now I was like the wash line 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 and remove the coarse winter oak 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.820
 You can do it at home too 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 you can do your home in the yard 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.570
 with a steam radiator itself has already 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.850
 cumshot the wheel arches rhine and the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.410
 rough rubbish should just get down 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.600
 but then still in the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
 wash road is also easy 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.050
 the subsoil is cleaned and the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.550
 whole salt roll chippings and dirt from 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 winter everything was played 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.570
 and what is special when polishing 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.360
 important in polishing we endure the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.000
 polish only on hot moves on 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.920
 best around the car then let us 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.050
 Dry a bit and then go 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
 We'll come here and do that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.170
 the dry side exactly and us 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.520
 really nice and quiet with strong pressure 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 april her is it really radiant and 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.980
 shines where does it feel good that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.250
 polishing 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.100
 on the one hand, the car protects in the summer 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.489
 also the sunlight from UV light 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.640
 and we see the same everywhere 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.440
 Small marks of rollplutt in winter 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.670
 road vehicles and so on we can 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.080
 the same with a better one 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.970
 paint pen before there washes 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.440
 developed because when the roche comes 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.769
 that one is the workshop and then it will be 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.769
 again expensive 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.520
 German quite good but warriors already 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.680
 That's why I have the one earlier 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.300
 Jerk off before and also 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.690
 the wheel boxes creep still depends on the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.489
 whole dirt and schlunz in it 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.480
 to re-work good music or for those who 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.550
 rim is clean 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.540
 they are already looking really good 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.680
 because I can now actually already the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 Raise summer tires 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.459
 there is the rule of o to o of 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.709
 october to easter 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.810
 you should not switch to it before 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.630
 Austria is also legally 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.670
 Duty to 15 april if you have it before 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.780
 changes and it happens what I just do 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.340
 still liable 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 he is really nice weather 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.069
 hot temperatures but at night it can 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.840
 keep getting cold and 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.269
 freeze what if mine 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.069
 interest already too little profile 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.110
 I can do that in the winter 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.250
 summer should just continue on 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.140
 do not make a case 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.030
 that's another rubber mix 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.130
 winter tires is much softer because he 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.959
 you just have to endure the cold 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.080
 now in summer on shoots then rumbles 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.790
 under www eraser you have 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.049
 with summer tires better driving behavior 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.730
 more grip in dry wet roadway 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.230
 the braking distance is much shorter from the he 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.560
 Definitely summer summer tires 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.560
 winter tires 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.000
 What is the secret now? 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.280
 behind that you have the slices too 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.050
 inside cleans easily in winter 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.760
 times a lot of moisture in the car 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.290
 through the snow and rain and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.739
 muddy what if you wear in with and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.650
 This often causes condensation on the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.330
 slice on it often just a little 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.079
 briefly sees the tempo over it vision 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.130
 and then there is a right one 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.590
 lubricity 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.630
 if now always in the spring at low 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.620
 standing sun in the evening fumble them first 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.690
 is nothing at all anymore 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.580
 Therefore, necessarily from the inside 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.700
 Clean the windows but now 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.620
 previously made the paint outside summer 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.210
 So protected against sunlight 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.630
 one in the interior somehow 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.710
 do 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.120
 You can tell them about the fittings in front 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.710
 again in the cockpit spray over it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.210
 just dust all the dirt 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.370
 get out and then here 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.900
 Rubber seals should be a fat one 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.030
 because in the winter has once again extreme 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.380
 cold extreme heat there suffers 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.180
 material and easy with a rubber 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.010
 pen just drive over there and 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.930
 everything that does not belong to the car 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.300
 So we need the snow chains 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
 do not drive around anymore 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.100
 antifreeze need now 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.020
 actually not anymore if I have the 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.130
 box still on the roof is down with it 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.410
 we do not need that much anymore 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.850
 sprit then car again shipshape 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.850
 ready for spring 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.960
 so you do still look at the 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.379
 Bonnet is also very important 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.469
 actually you can now the 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.520
 antifreeze everywhere omit the jawoll 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.339
 Advance no longer need 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.509
 That's what makes one write clearly 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:26.999
 simple is a stronger one 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.349
 detergent in it so the mosquitoes 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.659
 and what with a lot of everything on the discs 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.479
 sticking have better be removed then 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.919
 would actually be our auto formats the 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.830
 otherwise you could also go with yours 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.050
 yes my rally car is only from 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.529
 March to October on the race track 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.360
 on the way from here I do not need 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.819
 would say with prestigious round 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.930
 that's what every bodo forester does 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.589
 Of course, because I'm scared 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.589
 drive 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.640
 So how do you fit your driving style 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.560
 now in the warm season 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.030
 now in the spring we have to look at each one 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.730
 pay more attention to it 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.780
 everything becomes an active motorcyclist again 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.010
 are on the way again 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.680
 maybe not quite so 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.020
 surely people are more out there 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.510
 cyclist pedestrian stroller 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.100
 the children play one in the evening 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.500
 At dusk, we have increased image changes 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.730
 in forest areas clear exactly 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.890
 wetlands possibly too 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.770
 toad walks and how can you feel 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.660
 then in the car too much heat in the car 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.600
 you should be careful that you from 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.610
 time to time exchanges its filter 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.170
 an air conditioning 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.760
 These are uncanny bacteria inhibits 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.740
 many do not know that easily 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.960
 exchange in the workshop if 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.910
 you are in a traffic jam and the car is too much 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.930
 In any case, the heat should get 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.090
 turn on the heater 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.910
 so that the heat from the engine over the 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.020
 Ventilation are derived in the car 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.360
 not so pleasant 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.760
 that will continue to work well for the 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.850
 motor but for the interior he struggles 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.650
 Open everything in the window 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.690
 the leon you enjoy here 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.400
 still our ride thank you for 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.710
 We will stay, too 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.090
 tomorrow here at Lake Constance you can do that 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.520
 weather always very fast 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.930
 turn over and especially if so much 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.070
 Wind is advised again and again 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.450
 people in distress 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.610
 That's why we're doing an exercise tomorrow 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.290
 the water police so up 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.760
 tomorrow when we show one and each one 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.760
 or the weather is perfect
