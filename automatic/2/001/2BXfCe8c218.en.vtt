as you can see here to get this beside

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.679 
as you can see here to get this beside
of<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:29.750> bumper<00:03:30.079> beam<00:03:30.260> off<00:03:30.469> there<00:03:30.829> is<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.069> bolt

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
of the bumper beam off there is a bolt

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.539 
of the bumper beam off there is a bolt
that<00:03:32.689> goes<00:03:32.719> in<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.200> center<00:03:33.469> of<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.250> hole

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
that goes in the center of this hole

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.240 
that goes in the center of this hole
which<00:03:34.879> you<00:03:35.030> can't<00:03:35.269> really<00:03:35.510> see<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.019> dark

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
which you can't really see on the dark

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.849 
which you can't really see on the dark
but<00:03:37.250> it's<00:03:37.640> obviously<00:03:38.480> gonna<00:03:38.810> impact<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.709> there

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
but it's obviously gonna impact in there

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.009 
but it's obviously gonna impact in there
and<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.129> so<00:03:40.579> I<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.700> zip<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.209> off<00:03:41.390> well<00:03:41.719> on<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
and just so I can zip it off well on the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.599 
and just so I can zip it off well on the
other<00:03:42.140> side<00:03:42.409> on<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.680> goddamn<00:03:43.040> bumper<00:03:43.400> beams

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
other side on the goddamn bumper beams

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.390 
other side on the goddamn bumper beams
this<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> hidden<00:03:44.720> bolt<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:46.280> you're

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
cutting this whole beam off would be a

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.039 
cutting this whole beam off would be a
total<00:03:54.590> fucking<00:03:55.069> nightmare<00:03:58.599> of<00:03:59.599> course<00:03:59.840> my

let's<00:05:39.970> talk<00:05:40.090> about<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.390> bumper<00:05:40.690> beam<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:41.050> a

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
let's talk about the bumper beam for a

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.630 
let's talk about the bumper beam for a
second<00:05:41.470> this<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:41.950> what<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.160> car<00:05:42.340> looks<00:05:42.580> like

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
second this is what the car looks like

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.500 
second this is what the car looks like
without<00:05:42.910> it<00:05:43.090> okay<00:05:44.020> now<00:05:44.560> most<00:05:44.710> cars<00:05:45.010> have<00:05:45.220> that

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
without it okay now most cars have that

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.060 
without it okay now most cars have that
and<00:05:46.510> I've<00:05:46.630> seen<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:47.080> FRS<00:05:47.620> world<00:05:47.830> people

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
and I've seen in FRS world people

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.470 
and I've seen in FRS world people
actually<00:05:48.370> removing<00:05:48.730> their<00:05:48.850> bumper<00:05:49.120> beams<00:05:49.300> so

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
actually removing their bumper beams so

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.000 
actually removing their bumper beams so
they<00:05:49.630> could<00:05:49.780> fit<00:05:49.960> bigger<00:05:50.230> intercoolers<00:05:50.980> and

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
they could fit bigger intercoolers and

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.650 
they could fit bigger intercoolers and
all<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.430> other<00:05:51.580> bullshit<00:05:52.180> they<00:05:52.330> put<00:05:52.510> in<00:05:52.600> the

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
all that other bullshit they put in the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.590 
all that other bullshit they put in the
front<00:05:53.460> but<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:54.610> is<00:05:54.760> what<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.090> bumper<00:05:55.420> looks

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
front but this is what the bumper looks

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.260 
front but this is what the bumper looks
like<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.320> bumper<00:05:56.650> beam<00:05:56.800> off<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.340> car<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.820> can

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
like the bumper beam off the car you can

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.840 
like the bumper beam off the car you can
see<00:05:58.540> a<00:05:58.780> 20<00:05:59.380> mile<00:05:59.560> an<00:05:59.710> impact<00:06:00.040> 20<00:06:00.490> mile<00:06:00.640> an<00:06:00.670> hour

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
see a 20 mile an impact 20 mile an hour

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.120 
see a 20 mile an impact 20 mile an hour
impact<00:06:01.090> just<00:06:01.540> push<00:06:01.810> this<00:06:01.990> in<00:06:02.200> here<00:06:02.440> this<00:06:02.980> is

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
impact just push this in here this is

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.610 
impact just push this in here this is
the<00:06:03.220> good<00:06:03.400> side<00:06:03.640> so<00:06:04.450> this<00:06:04.600> is<00:06:04.780> exactly<00:06:05.140> what

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
the good side so this is exactly what
