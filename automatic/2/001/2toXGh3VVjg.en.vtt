hey geeks open up rows and cons today

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.740 
hey geeks open up rows and cons today
we're<00:00:02.580> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> be<00:00:02.850> learning<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.510> make

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
we're going to be learning how to make

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.710 
we're going to be learning how to make
star<00:00:04.290> butterflies<00:00:04.770> wand<00:00:05.130> from<00:00:05.700> star<00:00:06.330> versus

star butterflies wand from star versus

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:16.790 
star butterflies wand from star versus
the<00:00:06.899> forces<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.410> evil<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> materials<00:00:16.619> are

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the forces of evil the materials are

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.730 
the forces of evil the materials are
gonna<00:00:16.890> need<00:00:17.220> are<00:00:17.930> some<00:00:18.930> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.289> foam

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
gonna need are some kind of foam

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.150 
gonna need are some kind of foam
insulation<00:00:20.570> board<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.560> good<00:00:22.769> for

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
insulation board this is really good for

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.779 
insulation board this is really good for
just<00:00:23.519> general<00:00:24.119> purpose<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.320> got<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.130> half-inch

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
just general purpose I got the half-inch

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.980 
just general purpose I got the half-inch
thick<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.390> also<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:28.590> piece<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.519> an<00:00:30.390> inch<00:00:30.630> thick

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
thick I also got piece of an inch thick

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
thick I also got piece of an inch thick
so<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> gonna<00:00:32.850> basically<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> core

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
so this is gonna basically be the core

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.889 
so this is gonna basically be the core
you're<00:00:34.620> also<00:00:34.770> gonna<00:00:34.950> need<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.430> PVC<00:00:36.239> pipe<00:00:36.420> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you're also gonna need a PVC pipe I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
you're also gonna need a PVC pipe I
chose<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.500> half-inch<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.790> fit<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.090> my

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
chose the half-inch because it fit in my

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
chose the half-inch because it fit in my
hand<00:00:39.559> very<00:00:40.559> nicely<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.219> probably<00:00:41.430> won't<00:00:41.610> need

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
hand very nicely I probably won't need

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
hand very nicely I probably won't need
this<00:00:42.000> entire<00:00:42.420> link<00:00:42.780> another<00:00:43.410> thing<00:00:43.680> you're

gonna need is a hot knife you don't have
to<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.410> good<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
cutting through that foam and makes it a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
cutting through that foam and makes it a
lot<00:00:53.280> easier<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.699> cut<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.649> utility<00:00:55.649> knife

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
lot easier to cut than a utility knife

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.889 
lot easier to cut than a utility knife
would<00:00:56.579> another<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.750> probably

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
gonna need is a dremel or a rotary tool

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
gonna need is a dremel or a rotary tool
you're<00:01:01.800> also<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.000> compass<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
you're also going to need a compass and

you're also going to need a compass and
a<00:01:03.780> ruler<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> first<00:01:05.670> step<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a ruler because what the first step is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
a ruler because what the first step is
is<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.260> compass<00:01:07.710> and

is you're gonna take your compass and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
is you're gonna take your compass and
measure<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.939> four<00:01:09.479> inches<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.320> four

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
measure out about four inches a four

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
measure out about four inches a four
inch<00:01:10.830> circle<00:01:11.220> cut<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> your

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
inch circle cut that out out of your

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.770 
inch circle cut that out out of your
thick<00:01:13.110> foam<00:01:13.770> board<00:01:14.159> we're<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.479> cut

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
thick foam board we're also gonna cut

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.249 
thick foam board we're also gonna cut
two<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.590> four<00:01:16.979> inch<00:01:17.159> circles<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.259> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
two more four inch circles out of the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
two more four inch circles out of the
half-inch<00:01:20.130> thick<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.970> we're<00:01:21.150> also

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
half-inch thick and then we're also

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.560 
half-inch thick and then we're also
going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> cut<00:01:22.200> three<00:01:23.009> three<00:01:23.850> inch<00:01:24.060> circles

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
going to cut three three inch circles

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to cut three three inch circles
now<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> reason<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.710> say<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.340> inch

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
now the reason I say three three inch

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
now the reason I say three three inch
circles<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> haven't<00:01:27.540> decided<00:01:27.930> if

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
circles is because I haven't decided if

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.499 
circles is because I haven't decided if
I'm<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.950> need<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.369> third<00:01:29.670> circle<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> kind

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
I'm gonna need that third circle to kind

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
I'm gonna need that third circle to kind
of<00:01:30.600> round<00:01:30.810> out<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> next<00:01:32.340> thing

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
of round out the back so the next thing

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
of round out the back so the next thing
you're<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.299> you're<00:01:33.540> gonna<00:01:33.600> take

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
your hot knife I'm gonna finish cutting

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.780 
your hot knife I'm gonna finish cutting
this<00:01:36.479> last<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> circle<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:38.729> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.280 

we<00:01:48.800> are<00:01:48.920> finish<00:01:49.220> cutting<00:01:49.550> it<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.990> now<00:01:51.140> we're

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
we are finish cutting it so now we're

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.460 
we are finish cutting it so now we're
gonna<00:01:51.380> get<00:01:51.860> some<00:01:52.130> wood<00:01:52.370> glue<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.320> glue<00:01:54.320> these

gonna get some wood glue and glue these
pieces<00:01:54.770> together<00:01:55.010> and<00:01:55.430> let<00:01:55.640> them<00:01:55.760> sit<00:01:56.000> for<00:01:56.180> a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
pieces together and let them sit for a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.920 
pieces together and let them sit for a
while

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
while

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
just want to do a thin thin layer so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540 
just want to do a thin thin layer so
maybe<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.600> not<00:02:03.260> even<00:02:03.500> much<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:04.190> like<00:02:04.340> a

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
maybe just not even much just like a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.210 
maybe just not even much just like a
line<00:02:04.990> all<00:02:05.990> right<00:02:06.050> now<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.440> gonna<00:02:06.710> take<00:02:06.980> at

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
line all right now this is gonna take at

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.940 
line all right now this is gonna take at

least a few hours to dry then we're
gonna<00:02:10.040> take<00:02:11.110> one<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.290> circles<00:02:13.570> all<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
gonna take one of the circles all the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.680 
gonna take one of the circles all the
extra<00:02:15.260> dust<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.860> junk<00:02:16.070> off<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:17.390> just

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
extra dust and junk off of it and just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.450 
extra dust and junk off of it and just
squish<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.110> together<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.220> been<00:02:19.310> about

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
squish it together so it's been about

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.730 
squish it together so it's been about
two<00:02:19.700> hours<00:02:19.880> as<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:20.870> see<00:02:21.110> they're<00:02:21.620> not

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
two hours as you can see they're not

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.830 
two hours as you can see they're not
moving<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.760> think<00:02:23.030> we're<00:02:23.210> ready<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.540> start

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
moving and I think we're ready to start

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.570 
moving and I think we're ready to start
shaping<00:02:24.470> them<00:02:24.860> look<00:02:25.070> what<00:02:25.220> you're<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.490> gonna

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
shaping them look what you're just gonna

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:37.330 
shaping them look what you're just gonna
do<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:27.040> kind<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:35.710> let<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:36.890> this<00:02:37.100> is

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
do is kind of just let you know this is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.740 
do is kind of just let you know this is
gonna<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> lot<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.270> mess<00:02:38.740> after<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> lot<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
gonna make a lot of mess after a lot of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.530 
gonna make a lot of mess after a lot of
grading<00:02:41.750> down<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.350> stuff<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.150> shape

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
grading down and stuff this is the shape

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.260 
grading down and stuff this is the shape
we<00:02:44.900> now<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.440> I'm<00:02:46.010> gonna<00:02:46.100> sand<00:02:46.490> it<00:02:46.580> down<00:02:46.640> with

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
we now have I'm gonna sand it down with

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.180 
we now have I'm gonna sand it down with
some<00:02:47.840> sandpaper<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.650> make<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> little<00:02:49.040> bit

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
some sandpaper and make it a little bit

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.729 
some sandpaper and make it a little bit
smoother<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.780> we're<00:02:51.320> gonna<00:02:51.410> seal<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
smoother and then we're gonna seal it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.650 
smoother and then we're gonna seal it
with<00:02:52.070> some<00:02:52.310> wood<00:02:52.489> glue<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:53.120> been<00:02:53.450> about<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
with some wood glue it's been about a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.260 
with some wood glue it's been about a
day<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.260> shaved<00:02:54.890> down<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> little<00:02:55.520> bit<00:02:55.640> more<00:02:55.880> of

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
day I shaved down a little bit more of

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.150 
day I shaved down a little bit more of
the<00:02:56.600> size<00:02:56.810> because<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.410> realized<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.040> was<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the size because I realized it was a

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.880 
the size because I realized it was a
little<00:02:58.760> bit<00:02:59.000> too<00:02:59.270> big<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.200> next<00:03:00.380> step<00:03:00.620> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
little bit too big so the next step is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.220 
little bit too big so the next step is
I'm<00:03:01.760> gonna<00:03:01.940> take<00:03:02.090> our<00:03:02.209> wood<00:03:02.420> glue<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.989> start

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
I'm gonna take our wood glue just start

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.449 
I'm gonna take our wood glue just start
to<00:03:03.350> paint<00:03:03.530> layers<00:03:03.890> on<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:06.140> disk<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.340> is

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
to paint layers on just disk now this is

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.210 
to paint layers on just disk now this is
gonna<00:03:07.610> be<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.360> fairly<00:03:09.290> lengthy<00:03:09.739> process

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
gonna be a fairly lengthy process

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.810 
gonna be a fairly lengthy process
because<00:03:11.230> you're<00:03:12.230> gonna<00:03:12.320> paint<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.680> layer<00:03:12.860> wait

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
because you're gonna paint a layer wait

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.790 
because you're gonna paint a layer wait
till<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.180> good<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.510> dry<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:15.440> paint<00:03:15.650> another

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
till it's good and dry and paint another

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.650 
till it's good and dry and paint another
layer<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.489> another<00:03:16.760> layer<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.480> another

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
layer and another layer and another

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.170 
layer and another layer and another
layer<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:18.980> gonna<00:03:19.160> take<00:03:19.430> at<00:03:19.760> least<00:03:19.820> a

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
layer so it's it's gonna take at least a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.720 
layer so it's it's gonna take at least a
day<00:03:20.330> or<00:03:20.360> two<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.959> do<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.680> part<00:03:22.070> now<00:03:22.459> as<00:03:22.610> you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
day or two to do this part now as you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.360 
day or two to do this part now as you
can<00:03:22.850> see<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.690> left<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.709> middle<00:03:25.300> bare<00:03:26.470> because<00:03:27.470> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
can see I left the middle bare because I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.460 
can see I left the middle bare because I
totally<00:03:28.910> forgot<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:30.310> stick<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.580> wand<00:03:32.510> handle

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
totally forgot to stick the wand handle

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.510 
totally forgot to stick the wand handle
in<00:03:33.920> kind<00:03:34.550> of<00:03:34.670> line<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.239> up<00:03:35.920> roughly<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.370> where

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
in kind of line this up roughly to where

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.580 
in kind of line this up roughly to where
I<00:03:37.550> want<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.970> be<00:03:38.120> draw<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> line<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:38.930> there<00:03:39.380> so

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
I want it to be draw a line on there so

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.100 
I want it to be draw a line on there so
that<00:03:39.650> way<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> know<00:03:40.040> where<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.580> cut<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.150> now

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
that way I know where to cut it and now

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.320 
that way I know where to cut it and now
we're<00:03:42.260> gonna<00:03:42.350> go<00:03:42.530> outside<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.400> cut<00:03:43.760> it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.910 

basically<00:03:49.330> what<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.540> did<00:03:49.660> was<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:50.020> just<00:03:50.319> found

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
basically what I did was I just found

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.570 
basically what I did was I just found
the<00:03:51.160> best<00:03:51.370> angle<00:03:52.000> from<00:03:52.840> both<00:03:53.080> sides<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:54.550> I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
the best angle from both sides and so I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.210 
the best angle from both sides and so I
mark<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.090> with<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:56.230> dot<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.920> that's<00:03:57.069> what

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
mark that with a dot and that's what

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.970 
mark that with a dot and that's what
we're<00:03:57.310> gonna<00:03:57.400> drill<00:03:57.760> I'm<00:03:58.030> going<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.420> take<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
we're gonna drill I'm going to take the

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:10.170 
we're gonna drill I'm going to take the
pipe<00:03:59.980> trace<00:04:00.610> around<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.470> pipe<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:09.760> completely

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
pipe trace around the pipe be completely

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.660 
pipe trace around the pipe be completely
coated<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:11.170> wood<00:04:11.620> glue<00:04:11.830> but<00:04:12.100> about<00:04:12.280> four

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
coated this in wood glue but about four

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.990 
coated this in wood glue but about four
layers<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.989> actual<00:04:14.440> wand<00:04:15.040> part<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.730> only

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
layers on the actual wand part and only

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.670 
layers on the actual wand part and only
a<00:04:16.030> layer<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.390> here<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.140> that<00:04:17.290> way<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
a layer on here just so that way the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.310 
a layer on here just so that way the
gesso<00:04:18.010> will<00:04:18.430> stick<00:04:18.669> nice<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:19.150> it<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:20.109> went

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
gesso will stick nice to it so I went

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.159 
gesso will stick nice to it so I went
and<00:04:20.380> got<00:04:20.470> some<00:04:20.530> craft<00:04:20.980> foam<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:22.180> traced<00:04:22.960> out

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
and got some craft foam and I traced out

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.640 
and got some craft foam and I traced out
the<00:04:23.800> wings<00:04:23.980> I'm<00:04:24.700> gonna<00:04:24.880> cut<00:04:25.090> them<00:04:25.210> out<00:04:25.270> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
the wings I'm gonna cut them out and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.220 
the wings I'm gonna cut them out and
surround<00:04:26.650> them<00:04:26.950> with<00:04:26.980> worbla<00:04:27.780> which<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
surround them with worbla which is a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.360 
surround them with worbla which is a
heat<00:04:29.560> moldable<00:04:30.480> material<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.630> have<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:32.590> worbla

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
heat moldable material I have the worbla

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.580 
heat moldable material I have the worbla
cutouts<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.570> basically<00:04:34.930> just<00:04:35.080> wrap<00:04:35.410> them

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
cutouts and so basically just wrap them

around each other and if you'll notice
there's<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.380> kind<00:04:38.980> of<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.160> glossy<00:04:39.640> side<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.780> them

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
there's a kind of a glossy side to them

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.110 
there's a kind of a glossy side to them
that's<00:04:41.260> kind<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.890> help<00:04:42.100> stick<00:04:42.700> them<00:04:42.910> to

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
that's kind of that help stick them to

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.180 
each other and you see how it just kind
of<00:04:49.360> sticks<00:04:49.690> together<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.410> basically<00:04:51.010> what

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
want to seal in the foam so this is

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.090 
want to seal in the foam so this is
pretty<00:04:58.330> much<00:04:58.419> what<00:04:58.780> our<00:04:58.990> two<00:04:59.260> wings<00:04:59.560> look<00:04:59.890> like

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
pretty much what our two wings look like

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.640 
pretty much what our two wings look like
and<00:05:00.430> what<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.610> did<00:05:00.910> was<00:05:01.450> as<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.960> gets<00:05:02.140> kind<00:05:02.530> of

and what I did was as you gets kind of
see<00:05:02.860> is<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:04.110> traced<00:05:05.110> lines<00:05:05.229> here<00:05:06.190> because

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
see is I traced lines here because

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.090 
see is I traced lines here because
that's<00:05:07.270> where<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.630> wings<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:08.350> gonna<00:05:08.470> go<00:05:08.770> and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
that's where the wings are gonna go and

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.219 
that's where the wings are gonna go and
so<00:05:09.790> what<00:05:10.240> I'm<00:05:10.330> gonna<00:05:10.419> do<00:05:10.660> is<00:05:10.930> I'm<00:05:11.050> going<00:05:11.169> to

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.500 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
take<00:05:11.350> my<00:05:11.530> rotary<00:05:11.860> tool<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.490> kind<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:12.910> drill<00:05:13.240> in

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
take my rotary tool and kind of drill in

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.080 
take my rotary tool and kind of drill in
there<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> little<00:05:14.080> bit<00:05:14.290> so<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.190> way<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.820> can

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
there a little bit so that way I can

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.510 
there a little bit so that way I can
stick<00:05:16.570> them<00:05:16.780> in<00:05:16.960> there<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.530> glue<00:05:17.710> them<00:05:17.890> in<00:05:18.070> and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
stick them in there and glue them in and

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
stick them in there and glue them in and
that<00:05:19.330> way<00:05:19.450> they'll<00:05:19.660> be<00:05:19.720> stable<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:21.120> nice<00:05:22.120> and

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
that way they'll be stable and nice and

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.360 
that way they'll be stable and nice and
fit<00:05:22.810> nicely<00:05:23.020> into<00:05:23.350> this<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.860> then<00:05:24.130> we<00:05:24.340> can

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
fit nicely into this and then we can

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.840 
fit nicely into this and then we can
wood<00:05:24.820> glue<00:05:25.169> cover<00:05:26.169> everything<00:05:26.770> and<00:05:27.250> then

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
wood glue cover everything and then

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.150 
wood glue cover everything and then
start<00:05:28.150> just<00:05:28.419> sewing<00:05:28.720> alright<00:05:29.140> geeks<00:05:29.410> so<00:05:29.919> I

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
thought my camera was recording while I

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.760 
thought my camera was recording while I
was<00:05:31.930> putting<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.979> wings<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.729> was<00:05:33.880> not
