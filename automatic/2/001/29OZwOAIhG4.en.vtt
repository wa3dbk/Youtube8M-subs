I<00:00:05.770> can<00:00:06.609> either<00:00:06.809> create<00:00:07.809> art<00:00:08.320> that's<00:00:08.740> offensive

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
I can either create art that's offensive

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.769 
I can either create art that's offensive
defensive<00:00:11.769> or<00:00:12.100> I<00:00:12.160> could<00:00:12.610> create<00:00:13.000> our<00:00:13.450> that<00:00:14.049> is

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779 
defensive or I could create our that is

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.599 
defensive or I could create our that is
accessible<00:00:16.779> I<00:00:17.170> think<00:00:17.770> my<00:00:17.949> chosen<00:00:18.689> art<00:00:19.689> form<00:00:20.230> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
accessible I think my chosen art form is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.060 
accessible I think my chosen art form is
really<00:00:21.609> sort<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.360> I<00:00:22.960> think<00:00:23.410> it's<00:00:23.590> sculpture

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
really sort of I think it's sculpture

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.010 
really sort of I think it's sculpture
but<00:00:24.940> sculpture<00:00:25.510> that<00:00:25.750> also<00:00:25.960> has<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.420> ability

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
but sculpture that also has the ability

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.010 
but sculpture that also has the ability
to<00:00:29.470> be<00:00:29.920> brought<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.640> body<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.240> then

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
to be brought to the body and then

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.979 
to be brought to the body and then
utilized<00:00:32.680> in<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.550> series<00:00:34.059> of<00:00:34.090> performance

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
utilized in a series of performance

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.110 
utilized in a series of performance
activities<00:00:36.120> I'm<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.329> graduate<00:00:37.810> from<00:00:37.890> Cranbrook

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
activities I'm a graduate from Cranbrook

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.780 
activities I'm a graduate from Cranbrook
and<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.450> think<00:00:40.870> what<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.320> received<00:00:41.770> from<00:00:42.489> that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
and I think what I received from that

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.090 
and I think what I received from that
experience<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.540> knowing<00:00:44.410> how<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.590> trust

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
experience was knowing how to trust

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.470 
experience was knowing how to trust
myself<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:47.020> so<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.290> think<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.370> was<00:00:49.149> the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
myself and so I think that that was the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.900 
myself and so I think that that was the
beginning<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:50.110> me<00:00:50.500> after<00:00:50.860> graduation<00:00:50.980> taking

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
beginning of me after graduation taking

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.229 
beginning of me after graduation taking
charge<00:00:52.180> of<00:00:52.420> my<00:00:52.570> life<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:55.140> recognizing<00:00:56.140> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
charge of my life and recognizing that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.170 
charge of my life and recognizing that
this<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.570> how<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.290> want<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.770> go<00:01:00.010> about<00:01:00.280> existing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
this is how I want to go about existing

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.619 
this is how I want to go about existing
in<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:02.379> world<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.460> using<00:01:04.000> art<00:01:04.210> as<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.420> vehicle

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
in the world and using art as a vehicle

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.410 
in the world and using art as a vehicle
to<00:01:05.469> arrive<00:01:06.070> at<00:01:06.310> different<00:01:06.700> perspectives

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.050 

that<00:01:12.420> sound<00:01:12.720> suit<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.520> sculptural<00:01:14.520> object

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that sound suit is a sculptural object

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
that sound suit is a sculptural object
that<00:01:15.590> has<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.010> possibility<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.420> being<00:01:18.920> worn

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that has the possibility of being worn

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.250 
that has the possibility of being worn
on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> body<00:01:20.370> but<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> sound<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> generated

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
on the body but the sound is generated

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.050 
on the body but the sound is generated
from<00:01:22.920> materials<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:24.120> make<00:01:25.020> noise<00:01:26.030> such<00:01:27.030> as

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
from materials that make noise such as

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.770 
from materials that make noise such as
bottle<00:01:27.870> caps<00:01:28.110> twigs<00:01:29.690> raft<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:31.940> button<00:01:32.940> so<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bottle caps twigs raft the button so you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
bottle caps twigs raft the button so you
know<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.050> body<00:01:34.260> becomes<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.100> carrier<00:01:35.670> for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know the body becomes the carrier for

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
know the body becomes the carrier for
this<00:01:36.480> world<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.050> instrument<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.460> interesting

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this world or instrument the interesting

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.870 
this world or instrument the interesting
thing<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.690> work<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:41.040> one's<00:01:41.640> identity

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
thing about the work that one's identity

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.390 
thing about the work that one's identity
is<00:01:42.540> hidden<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> hides<00:01:44.600> gender<00:01:45.600> race<00:01:45.870> class

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
is hidden so it hides gender race class

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.040 
is hidden so it hides gender race class
so<00:01:47.400> we're<00:01:47.610> forced<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.900> work

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
so we're forced to look at the work

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.260 
so we're forced to look at the work
without<00:01:49.440> judgment<00:01:50.160> when<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:51.030> sort<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
without judgment when I really sort of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260 
without judgment when I really sort of
get<00:01:51.480> down<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.700> literally

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
get down to you know what it literally

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.380 
get down to you know what it literally
means<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.440> is<00:01:56.010> about<00:01:56.280> removing<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
means it really is about removing all of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.580 
means it really is about removing all of
it<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.900> can<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.530> come<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.330> a<00:02:00.330> point<00:02:01.140> where

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it so we can then come to a point where

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.850 
it so we can then come to a point where
we<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.090> open<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.750> something<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
we have to be open to something that is

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.130 
we have to be open to something that is
unfamiliar<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> how<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.690> we<00:02:06.960> respond<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.650> that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
unfamiliar and how do we respond to that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.430 
unfamiliar and how do we respond to that
Detroit<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.400> such<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> critical<00:02:12.060> part<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.380> my

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
Detroit was such a critical part of my

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.130
