 too we attracted the race 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.070
 diagonal display but miller is fine 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.530

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.510
 the front panel is completely covered 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.490
 the case as if fastened also 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.290
 the camera unit and speaker are covered 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.830
 metal plate 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.910
 plastic is available in exactly coverage in 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.080
 combination with the unusual shape of the side faces 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.630
 it promotes a good move 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.100
 devices just do not want to let it out 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.980
 out of hand 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.950
 trying to put the smartphone sim card 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.270
 annually faces 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.400
 problem and where actually 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.540
 without thinking understand how the voter phone 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.970
 it is difficult to unscrew the inter 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.340
 It turns out you need pharmacy support 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.360
 issuing smartphones back cover 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 and again the surprise apparatus is bright inside 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.720
 yellow but 1 3 here is a decorative element 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.620
 small but very attractive 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.350
 so it can be characterized 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.680
 Of course here I judge one moment 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 compactness has its advantages 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 vsts 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.160
 touch keys deservedly causes

 unreasonable happiness 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.700
 they work surprisingly well 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 the only problem is even 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.570
 blind 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.790
 lights also turn on on time 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.610
 display of change touched what 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.120
 had a positive effect on convenience 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.300

 devices based on windows but mom but there are 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.910

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.530
 the display is unusual for him 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.880
 there was a resolution for such a diagonal 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.080
 already much better than kiva ha but 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 expected problem leads 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.650
