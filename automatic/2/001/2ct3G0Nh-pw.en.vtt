00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
and great for better accuracy now this

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.089 
and great for better accuracy now this
doesn't<00:04:40.240> have<00:04:40.449> to<00:04:40.660> be<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.199> width<00:04:41.500> as<00:04:41.710> we<00:04:41.860> said

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
doesn't have to be that width as we said
