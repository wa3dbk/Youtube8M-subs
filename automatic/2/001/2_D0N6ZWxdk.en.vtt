00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.170
 so for the test we need three 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.840
 cups of flour 1 cup chilled 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.650
 kefir 100 grams of butter or

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.070
 kefir 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.440
 Kefir is better to take the cold so that the dough 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.440
 we got more magnificent 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 do not knead the dough with a fork then there 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.460
 by hands 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.349
 here it turned out the dough but it is slightly 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.180
 there are no hands on so I'll add 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.300
 two tablespoons of flour 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.780
 full and 2 tablespoons flour dough 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.420

 knead the amount of dough still depends 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.650
 the quality of the flour is possible to someone 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.200
