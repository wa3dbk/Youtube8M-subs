once again we're going to be doing two
on<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.130> as<00:01:34.220> well<00:01:34.399> I'm<00:01:34.700> playing<00:01:35.090> 17<00:01:35.720> of

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
on this one as well I'm playing 17 of

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.169 
on this one as well I'm playing 17 of
the<00:01:36.349> second<00:01:36.739> and<00:01:36.950> 17<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.640> fourth<00:01:37.879> and<00:01:38.119> I

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
the second and 17 of the fourth and I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:44.259 
the second and 17 of the fourth and I
knew<00:01:38.300> this<00:01:38.450> river<00:01:39.039> sorry<00:01:41.080> that's<00:01:42.080> why<00:01:43.269> all

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:44.269 
knew this river sorry that's why all

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:52.180 
knew this river sorry that's why all
together<00:01:45.110> thus<00:01:45.319> far

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.560 

hopefully<00:01:53.190> that's<00:01:53.340> making<00:01:53.700> sense<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
changing this formation I'm playing 9 /

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.800 
changing this formation I'm playing 9 /
v<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.680> 9<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> third<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.119> playing<00:02:00.360> 11

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
v and 9 of the third and then playing 11

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
v and 9 of the third and then playing 11
of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> second<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> fourth<00:02:01.770> we're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of the second and the fourth we're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.990 
of the second and the fourth we're
keeping<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.550> same<00:02:02.850> rhythm<00:02:04.670> I'll<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.790> doing

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
keeping that same rhythm I'll be doing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
keeping that same rhythm I'll be doing
that<00:02:06.030> twice<00:02:09.020> my<00:02:10.020> tap<00:02:10.289> comes<00:02:10.560> over<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> 12<00:02:11.160> for

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that twice my tap comes over to 12 for

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.900 
that twice my tap comes over to 12 for
the<00:02:11.430> second<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.680> 12<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> fourth<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.489> then

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the second and 12 of the fourth and then

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
the second and 12 of the fourth and then
my<00:02:15.030> pointer<00:02:15.510> jumps<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.709> 8th<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> sixth

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
my pointer jumps to 8th of the sixth

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.760 
my pointer jumps to 8th of the sixth
string<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.819> I'm<00:02:17.880> on<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> 6<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.900> 9<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
string so I'm on a to the 6 and 9 of the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.259 
string so I'm on a to the 6 and 9 of the
third<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> left<00:02:20.640> hand<00:02:20.819> I'll<00:02:20.970> play<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
third on the left hand I'll play this

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.960 
third on the left hand I'll play this
whole<00:02:21.450> idea<00:02:21.600> slowly<00:02:25.220> once<00:02:26.220> again<00:02:26.519> sort<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.790> two

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
whole idea slowly once again sort of two

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.430 
whole idea slowly once again sort of two
groups<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.600> far<00:02:27.840> pretty<00:02:28.170> much<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
groups so that's far pretty much the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.030 
groups so that's far pretty much the
second<00:02:28.739> half<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> bridge<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.739> then<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.920> go

back to the 911 one again twice okay we

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
back to the 911 one again twice okay we
go<00:02:39.989> back<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> shape<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.830> very<00:02:41.340> very

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
go back to the shape we have very very

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.759 
go back to the shape we have very very
side<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> bridge<00:02:42.300> my<00:02:42.900> 10<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.230> 5th<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
11 of the 3rd and then my taps are on 12

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.990 
11 of the 3rd and then my taps are on 12
the<00:02:46.890> 2nd<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> floor

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.680 

let's<00:02:51.000> go<00:02:51.120> through<00:02:51.269> all<00:02:51.330> we've<00:02:51.450> got<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
let's go through all we've got to the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.319 
let's go through all we've got to the
second<00:02:52.050> half<00:02:52.200> thus<00:02:52.500> far

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.670 

okay<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.780> want<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.019> repeat<00:03:04.200> those<00:03:04.379> last

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
okay I just want to repeat those last

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.080 
okay I just want to repeat those last
two<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.069> think<00:03:05.280> nine<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.640> eleven<00:03:05.939> again

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
two that I think nine and eleven again

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.009 
two that I think nine and eleven again
this<00:03:09.080> major<00:03:09.290> 7<00:03:09.769> 10<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.040> 11<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.209> left<00:03:11.810> hand

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
this major 7 10 and 11 on the left hand

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.020 
this major 7 10 and 11 on the left hand
and<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.709> right<00:03:12.950> tapping<00:03:13.310> 12<00:03:13.580> again<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:13.940> I'm

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
and in the right tapping 12 again so I'm

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.000 
and in the right tapping 12 again so I'm
going<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.180> go

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.559 

it's<00:03:21.010> going<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.189> have<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.430> twice<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:21.999> there's<00:03:22.510> a

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
it's going to have it twice so there's a

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.030 
it's going to have it twice so there's a
little<00:03:22.780> bit<00:03:22.870> more<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.200> let's<00:03:23.499> trial<00:03:23.709> we've<00:03:23.889> got

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
little bit more to let's trial we've got

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.170 
little bit more to let's trial we've got
from<00:03:24.219> this<00:03:24.310> stuff<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> we'll<00:03:24.879> put<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.120> all

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
from this stuff and we'll put it all

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:40.900 
from this stuff and we'll put it all
together

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.180

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
we've got a couple more shapes and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.120 
we've got a couple more shapes and
that's<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.870> whole<00:03:49.050> bridge<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.740> what<00:03:49.890> I've<00:03:49.980> got

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
that's the whole bridge so what I've got

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.860 
that's the whole bridge so what I've got
now<00:03:50.310> is<00:03:50.550> twelve<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.270> second<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
now is twelve on the second and the

fourth my tap and my left hand is doing
nine<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.360> fifth<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.810> nine<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> third

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380

nine of the fifth and nine of the third
I<00:03:55.590> want<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.860> do<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.100> formation<00:03:56.520> four<00:03:57.360> times

bring<00:04:05.940> my<00:04:06.060> tap<00:04:06.270> back<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.540> 11<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:06.960> I'm<00:04:07.170> 99<00:04:07.590> still

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
bring my tap back to 11 so I'm 99 still

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.710 
bring my tap back to 11 so I'm 99 still
and<00:04:08.130> 11<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:08.850> I'll<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.120> three<00:04:09.390> in<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.540> row<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
and 11 and I'll do three in a row the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.370 
and 11 and I'll do three in a row the
last<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:14.600> what<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.630> sort<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.930> stack<00:04:16.170> of<00:04:16.290> a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
last one what a sort of stack of a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:24.879 
last one what a sort of stack of a
spirit<00:04:16.770> slow<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.070> down

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.900 

that's<00:04:25.889> pretty<00:04:26.099> much<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.310> whole<00:04:26.430> bridge<00:04:26.729> so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
that's pretty much the whole bridge so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.370 
that's pretty much the whole bridge so
let's<00:04:27.060> try<00:04:27.240> to<00:04:27.300> look<00:04:27.479> in<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> little<00:04:27.840> bit<00:04:28.139> slow

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380
