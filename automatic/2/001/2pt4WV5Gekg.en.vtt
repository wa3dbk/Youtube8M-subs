00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.699
 they are not and not in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:09.540

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:11.189

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 subject that I have now told you 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.920
 would have been there so I hope you 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.619
 are not paid with the tariff wages 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.549
 that's right he kicks a lot 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.310
 less because the wage rates are the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 way too high, I mean 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170
 We have, we actually have 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.820
 already stated that you that you 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 too little is based but I do that at all 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.240
 So I do not mean anything to you 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 I already said the tariff 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020
 not earned at all 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.200
 that please i dont know what i believe 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.000
 It's tariff but I think it is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 tarif retailer already 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.399
 you know all has absolute as well 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.439
 you do not have to get water in 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.560
 end effect always gets deducted for 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.729
 the time he gets here, of course 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.530
 for everything else has easy to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 For example, if he has the next free path 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 Of course he also got something 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.719
 deducted if he actually 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.400
 truthfully 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:18.840
 answered and tell us 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.840

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.420
 I have not seen it myself yet 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.909
 he always drives in secret batman cave 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 to 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:33.159
 I was told 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.930
 rolex in the article is me but 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.680
 I'm not sure if that's true or 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.819
 her knowledge 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:46.829

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.829
