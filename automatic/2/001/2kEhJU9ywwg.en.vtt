00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:11.320
 i Hello me this is a movie vol 41 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:16.590
 Before introducing the railway model this time too 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:23.330
 I guess there's a lot of people saying that it's all about me 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:28.010
 I thought from the beginning that it is there properly Japan language Te wandering people after Kusasato 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.880
 I thought that Cleo was that high school student or something like that in Italy 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:37.540
 If you try to squeeze the white 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.700
 Well, so is the song of the Hina Matsuri Festival in the aftermath 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.160
 I like the paper lantern you put the lights 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.360
 Get in the water 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.010
 Hey, because it is not quite me I that kind of sound I Japanese 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.270
 I like Do Kana also gained some flowers to the paper lantern you put the lights 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 that 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.680
 I like Italian sometimes I like German 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.880
 I just misunderstood it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.430
 Oh dear 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:08.980
 It is will eh this time's go hurry 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 I would like to introduce Tommy's line scale remodeling sl 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:20.910
 8 It's a guy I bought in about 1972, but it 's off the beat of the country sounds 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.910
 Here it is to have been discovered 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.450
 There are many people who had this at the time 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.329
 Like this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.500
 Power back A 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.500
 What a nostalgic golden Per night 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.210
 It this I unfriendly feeling is good 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.120
 I have not been designed like this now 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.650
 You need a minimum 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.270
 Into yesterday 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.159
 Hirobi overflows 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.159
 However each older sister like that lunch box 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.580
 Power fuck is nice though 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.330
 This was sold in sl whether the car sound a total of 5-Car Set 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.590
 so 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.310
 I would like to see you for a moment 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.310
 L 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.490
 It is not a downturn 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.430
 With this lower part 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.550
 this time 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:38.170
 Although the shale to introduce it I tried a little remodeling 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.010
 That's it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.010
 Here you will 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 Yes 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.380
 It's a mystery 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.500
 At first glance 11 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:09.740
 Although the license plate is attached 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:13.640
 It is a very mysterious sl It is this It is that downturn 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.660
 Scale do not see that hey and 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.940
 I think this is I'm amazing I also do it but are using the things of 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.230
 that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.569
 Rod glasses full operation 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 Usually I 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.030
 That valve gear is Hey of this neighborhood 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.700
 It does not move though 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.120
 It says that it moves a little to the age bar of the reversing machine 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.860
 Now 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:57.550
 This is that original caramel motor 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:01.830
 Although I did restore that once a little 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.170
 After all the performance is low and it makes me feel awkward 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:10.630
 Micro Ace also for sl 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.990
 It will have been dry we have replaced the motor 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.340
 I will try to open it immediately 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.340
 Do you want to fly ? 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.009
 Yes i run smoothly 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.220
 I also 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.840
 The motor is 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.840
 New is better 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.409
 I so good at different levels housed Gane to door 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:10.289
 That fact also I really that steam locomotive is only simple is it the structure when to revive the 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:16.629
 It's easy to revive, but electric locomotives aren't good enough once they get lost 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:19.409
 Almost the performance of that time and the pattern of retirement that can not be repelled 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.409
 There are many, though 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.350
 That alone is a motor 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.000
 Consumables 2 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.890
 That's right 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.890
 I was able to feel the best 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.200
 I have a little bit more slowly? 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.610
 Please see the movement of the rod 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.340
 Something Pinto was ｰｰｰ 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.629
 It is fully working properly 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:26.650
 Was only once 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.650
 So we'll try to move it a little band 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.620
 It is easy to understand the movement of the rod 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:58.089
 Also say with full capacity to Rondo in this alone this I n gauge size 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.089
 But it is fun 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:03.280
 By all means in the present technology 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.270
 It Off of technology 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.080
 I think it's pretty easy 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:14.600
 One is because Warikashi way that I model railroad 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.600
 Once the format is decided, that's it 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.370
 Copy it to the right 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:25.009
 This but I'm that conservative feel to 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:33.070
 If you look at this kind of cat, that latest model is 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.150
 The best thing 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.150
 I can not say for a moment 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:41.569
 Great 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.569
 Though it is movement of rod 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.710
 Summarize 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:01.969
 This time is it like that 

00:07:56.249 --> 00:08:01.969
 We introduced mystery r for a while 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:10.900
 Well then, this time vol 42 days 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.900
 Let's meet you Creo was wonderful
