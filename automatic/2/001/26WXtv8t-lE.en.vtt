we've<00:00:11.390> built<00:00:11.600> into<00:00:11.870> this<00:00:11.990> stick<00:00:12.260> is<00:00:12.410> the

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
we've built into this stick is the

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.740 
we've built into this stick is the
intellisense<00:00:12.980> flex<00:00:13.519> profile<00:00:14.000> and<00:00:14.269> what<00:00:14.660> it

familiar with vapor sticks in the past
they've<00:00:20.839> always<00:00:21.019> had<00:00:21.289> that<00:00:21.470> low<00:00:21.800> kick<00:00:22.159> so<00:00:22.339> that

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:22.489 
they've always had that low kick so that

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.279 
they've always had that low kick so that
softer<00:00:22.970> low<00:00:23.119> area<00:00:23.449> so<00:00:23.599> you<00:00:23.689> can<00:00:23.839> get<00:00:23.929> off<00:00:24.079> that

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
softer low area so you can get off that

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.859 
softer low area so you can get off that
quick<00:00:24.470> wrist<00:00:24.859> shot<00:00:25.069> that<00:00:25.279> quick<00:00:25.489> snapshot<00:00:26.029> but

quick wrist shot that quick snapshot but

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.569 
quick wrist shot that quick snapshot but
we<00:00:27.259> wanted<00:00:27.499> to<00:00:27.529> try<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:27.949> make<00:00:28.069> sure<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.249> the

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
we wanted to try and make sure that the

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.849 
we wanted to try and make sure that the
new<00:00:28.730> vapor<00:00:28.970> sticks<00:00:29.359> had<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.810> real<00:00:30.199> powerful

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859

activate that second folks profile one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.470 
activate that second folks profile one
of<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.460> greatest<00:00:43.699> technologies<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.329> we've

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
of the greatest technologies that we've

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.150 
of the greatest technologies that we've
introduced<00:00:44.960> with<00:00:45.320> all<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.679> our<00:00:45.769> elite<00:00:46.010> level

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
introduced with all of our elite level

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.430 
introduced with all of our elite level
sticks<00:00:46.519> is<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:47.149> text<00:00:47.660> reham<00:00:47.870> carbon<00:00:48.199> fiber

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
sticks is this text reham carbon fiber

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.829 
sticks is this text reham carbon fiber
so<00:00:48.980> that's<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.399> big<00:00:49.460> carbon<00:00:50.179> fiber<00:00:50.390> squares

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
so that's this big carbon fiber squares

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.930 
so that's this big carbon fiber squares
and<00:00:51.050> what<00:00:51.679> that's<00:00:51.859> allowed<00:00:52.160> us<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.339> do<00:00:52.579> is<00:00:52.730> take

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
and what that's allowed us to do is take

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.069 
and what that's allowed us to do is take
the<00:00:53.120> weight<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.449> our<00:00:53.539> sticks<00:00:53.870> down

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
the weight of our sticks down

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.200 
the weight of our sticks down
significantly<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.489> durability<00:00:55.969> is

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
significantly so the durability is

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.700 
significantly so the durability is
really<00:00:56.510> enhanced<00:00:56.929> with<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.140> carbon<00:00:57.379> fiber

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
really enhanced with this carbon fiber

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.160 
really enhanced with this carbon fiber
as<00:00:57.920> well<00:00:58.100> I've<00:00:58.909> introduced<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.449> new<00:00:59.600> technology

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
as well I've introduced a new technology

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.869 
as well I've introduced a new technology
called<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.499> pure<00:01:00.710> shop<00:01:00.949> blade<00:01:01.249> profile<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
called the pure shop blade profile so

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.369 
called the pure shop blade profile so
we've<00:01:02.030> actually<00:01:02.179> kind<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.570> expanded<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
we've actually kind of expanded the

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.380 
we've actually kind of expanded the
transition<00:01:04.040> from<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.370> shaft<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:05.090> blade

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
transition from the shaft of the blade

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.090 
transition from the shaft of the blade
that's<00:01:05.930> going<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.140> help<00:01:06.260> prevent<00:01:06.620> overall

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that's going to help prevent overall

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.950 
that's going to help prevent overall
blade<00:01:07.400> deflection<00:01:07.940> so<00:01:08.120> your<00:01:08.270> pucks<00:01:08.630> your

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
blade deflection so your pucks your

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.270 
blade deflection so your pucks your
shots<00:01:09.230> are<00:01:09.410> going<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.590> go<00:01:09.740> where<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:09.980> wanted

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
shots are going to go where you wanted

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.950 
shots are going to go where you wanted
them<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.610> go<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:11.210> don't<00:01:11.390> have<00:01:11.480> to<00:01:11.600> compensate

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
them to go you don't have to compensate

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.690 
them to go you don't have to compensate
for<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.380> blade<00:01:12.590> may<00:01:12.770> be<00:01:12.830> opening<00:01:13.250> up<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.550> you

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
for the blade may be opening up on you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.580 
for the blade may be opening up on you
also<00:01:14.450> working<00:01:14.630> in<00:01:14.810> coordination<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
also working in coordination with the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.080 
also working in coordination with the
tech<00:01:15.860> stream<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.250> pure<00:01:16.550> shot<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
tech stream in the pure shot is the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.500 
tech stream in the pure shot is the
arrow<00:01:17.300> foam<00:01:17.630> blade<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.200> real<00:01:18.530> lightweight

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
arrow foam blade so real lightweight

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.850 
arrow foam blade so real lightweight
low-density<00:01:20.510> material<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.770> have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
low-density material it's going to have

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.200 
low-density material it's going to have
a<00:01:21.890> great<00:01:22.220> feel<00:01:22.520> that's<00:01:22.790> going<00:01:22.910> to<00:01:23.000> make<00:01:23.090> the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
a great feel that's going to make the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.210 
a great feel that's going to make the
balance<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.750> stick<00:01:23.990> really<00:01:24.380> good<00:01:24.590> it's

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
balance of this stick really good it's

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.260 
balance of this stick really good it's
one<00:01:25.370> of<00:01:25.430> those<00:01:25.550> things<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.850> when<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.090> pick

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
one of those things that when you pick

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.400 
one of those things that when you pick
this<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:26.600> you're<00:01:26.750> going<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.900> notice<00:01:27.080> right

this stick we also wanted to make sure
that<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.190> agile<00:01:49.700> player<00:01:49.970> who's<00:01:50.150> going

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
that for that agile player who's going

that for that agile player who's going
to<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.510> taking<00:01:50.870> those<00:01:50.960> quick<00:01:51.260> release<00:01:51.590> shots

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
to be taking those quick release shots

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.590 
to be taking those quick release shots
we<00:01:52.430> wanted<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.760> make<00:01:52.910> sure<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.330> shaft

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
we wanted to make sure that the shaft

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.270 
we wanted to make sure that the shaft
would<00:01:53.810> easily<00:01:53.990> roll<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.590> your<00:01:54.710> hands<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.160> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
would easily roll in your hands so the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.620 
would easily roll in your hands so the
vapor<00:01:55.520> family<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.060> going<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> little

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
vapor family is going to have a little

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.750 
vapor family is going to have a little
bit<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.870> a<00:01:57.050> more<00:01:57.230> round<00:01:57.500> shaft<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:58.130> comparison
