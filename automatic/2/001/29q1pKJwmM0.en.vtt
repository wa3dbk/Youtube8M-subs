00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.220
 tuttoandroid.net under our lens 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 huawei ashen g700 a quad smartphone 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.690
 core of huawei presented at the 2013 IFA 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.250
 today we have our whole camera 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.650
 and therefore we carry out an unboxing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.650
 and a first installation with goodbye 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.099
 this is the box we start with ad 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 open this here the device that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.669
 let's set aside to see the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.669
 content 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 as you can see everything stored inside 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 of this and this other box we have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.289
 a five-fold power supply for the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.289
 recharge 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.550
 after which usb cable where sb is for the di 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 kayak and to connect it obviously to a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 computer headsets that I show a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 moment as standard not in here cable 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.590
 normal and remote control to answer 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590
 to calls 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 then we find the manual then 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.670
 certain guarantees and a quick music manual 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.180
 and finally there should be the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:38.400
 battery battery that is 2150 milan 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.689
 for now we do not give in April for 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.890
 install the device as you see 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 with the removable here we have the two 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 the inputs for the sim are are 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.110
 standard and the input for the micro sd 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 then to expand the internal memory 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.340
 of the smartphone internal memory that is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 from 8 gigabytes 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.549
 instead we have 2 gigabytes of ram a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.049
 processor and mediatek quad core 65 mt 89 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.340
 what we saw a little about 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.600
 most smartphones that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.810
 we have reviewed recently 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.020
 based on mediatek platform let's start 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.840
 to turn it on I said quad core with 1.2 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.500
 gigahertz of android clock frequency 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.860
 in its 4.2 version we said 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.320
 expandable memory via microsd one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.970
 8 megapixel rear camera with 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.820
 LED flash capable of recording video in 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.380
 full hd and a camera instead 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.200
 front should be if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.840
 from 1.3 megapixels and allows 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.840
 record video up to 720p 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.020
 as regards the display instead 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.150
 we have a 5 inch unit with 1200 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.210
 80 x 720 pixels and therefore a definition 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.580
 of 294 ppi 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.950
 how do you see this boot animation the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.770
 device when it started up it is 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.640
 automatically formatted this is 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.980
 just the first start we are 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.630
 doing with you below the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 camera connectivity is type 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.430
 hsdp to up to 7.2 megabits per second in 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
 download instead we give an overview 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.140
 physics here we have three soft touch keys 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.380
 they are not seen because they are not 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.120
 backlit first during the farewell 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.640
 ie key a key back key 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.650
 settings after away with caps 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.680
 front camera sensor earpiece 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.750
 proximity and brightness on the remains 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.930
 instead we have the volume rocker 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.950
 and nothing else 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.210
 on the left the power button 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.240
 emblem and extinction and nothing higher 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.370
 the 3 mm jack and a half at the bottom 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.380
 micro usb port with microphone 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.210
 main in the back index 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.910
 we have logo huawei said camera 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.600
 flash LED and the system speaker 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.910
 which placed here on the lower left 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.180
 aesthetically it looks very similar to the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.890
 both ho mire drive we are testing in 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.020
 these days for which the review 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.240
 will arrive will come soon we will see how 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.920
 this device will behave during 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.660
 our test days meanwhile if 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.980
 you are interested you can give us some 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.359
 questions to which we will seek to 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.200
 answer within the review 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.910
 complete or for example 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.460
 load comparisons with other devices 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.750
 away and first all from emanuele 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.750
