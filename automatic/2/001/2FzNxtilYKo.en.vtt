00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 because my friends are almost ready 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.130
 to start our adventure as 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.980
 you can realize the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.719
 tractor is doing some field to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 me is the part where we're going to take off 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 and the air is perfect right now because 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 comes exactly on the line that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.650
 we are using bring comes from santis 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 we are cutting it right field in the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 south east you are in the part where I go 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.830
 to come that is the end where we are 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.510
 getting ready 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.630
 the way to make sure there is not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.059
 holes of the big holes of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.910
 prairie dogs 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.680
 Large animals do not look clean what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 I'm going to do is come here and I'm going to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 make a partner the take off a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.610
 landing takeoff on soft track that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.320
 it's something very common that we review 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.570
 in our training only that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.030
 now if it's going to be in life in life 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 I'm really excited because it's the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 first time that I happen to have to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 take a plane out of the middle of the fields 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.710
 but at the same time I feel safe 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 because that's what I've done many times 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 has already landed on pasture tracks 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.159
 around here we have several are 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 it really is not something new to me but 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.970
 if you never leave we have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 to be able to participate that kind of 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 experiences 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.990
 inside the chamber forgiveness inside the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.470
 cameras and outside to see it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.900
 also in the interesting takeoff already 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 we clean the plane of all material that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 I can do it heavy we have very little 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 gas 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 so we 're going to have the opportunity to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.310
 take off I just will not wait like 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.420
 student take off by myself to be able 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.420
 leave the plane to do it 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.580
 the campuses this was the beginning of me in 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.710
 the campuses not here in texas but they have 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.840
 you reach and bring a lot of land in 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.550
 the mouth and in the ears and everywhere 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.770
 he had already forgotten what it was like to work 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.240
 on campus and fill up on leg and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 socket and then and all that kind of stuff 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.740
 they are here but in the nation this video 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 my friends is not to try to hit him 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.539
 the brave or the very macho as we would say 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.130
 in mexico no no the reason for these are 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.960
 two once you realize that the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.910
 aviation is very safe and what 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.070
 you can do things in a way 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.140
 safe and legal also because we are 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.850
 with the law they gave us permission to take off 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.280
 of the entity and esb and gave us permission is 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.690
 hit the fbi and the local police that does not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.740
 we are violating any law nor are we 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.690
 doing one of hide and seek 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.310
 We are following the procedures that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.320
 the law dictates so we are doing 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.570
 an improvised track right now 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.370
 take off the plane and land it by 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.530
 please do not do this this is not a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.990
 example what you should do if 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 if you do not have the proper preparation I 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.170
 I have many hours of how I eat 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 instructor and as a commercial pilot 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.490
 taking off and landing of runways 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 grass that you do not feel safe 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.810
 to do something like this do not do it for 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.240
 please I do not know what's going to be a good video 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.580
 instructional about how it is that 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.620
 we can do to get a plane like 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.480
 in this case we fall emergency 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.730
 here in this place 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 willow will see right away in the video
