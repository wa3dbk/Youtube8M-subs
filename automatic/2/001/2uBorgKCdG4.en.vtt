today we're moving the fence route of a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.249 
today we're moving the fence route of a
sub<00:00:06.600> 2000<00:00:07.639> 293<00:00:08.639> turbo<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.830> fence<00:00:11.130> route<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
sub 2000 293 turbo the fence route is

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.930 
sub 2000 293 turbo the fence route is
with<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> radiator<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.460> front<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.790> the

step<00:00:16.560> 1<00:00:17.930> take<00:00:18.930> out<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> battery<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:30.500> off<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
step 1 take out the battery and off it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.940 
step 1 take out the battery and off it
goes<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.910> more<00:00:33.149> space<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.770> get<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
goes so you have more space you get to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.430 
goes so you have more space you get to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
to lift it if it's just like a radiator

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.400 
to lift it if it's just like a radiator
into<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.829> spot<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.079> bought<00:02:25.260> the

I also have to remove next to the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.259 
I also have to remove next to the
battery<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.170> power<00:02:31.410> steering<00:02:32.269> hose

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
battery this is the power steering hose

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.740 
battery this is the power steering hose
and<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> cheapest<00:02:35.370> holding<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.970> you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and that was the cheapest holding it you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
and that was the cheapest holding it you
have<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.079> remove<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.940> next<00:02:38.940> much<00:02:39.150> this

have to remove it and next much this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.599 
have to remove it and next much this
pipe<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:40.049> move<00:02:40.230> freely<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.519> to

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
pipe can move freely so you have to

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.509 
pipe can move freely so you have to
disconnect<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> now<00:02:42.329> sit<00:02:42.599> both<00:02:42.810> hoses<00:02:43.260> are

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
disconnect it now sit both hoses are

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.819 
disconnect it now sit both hoses are
moving<00:02:44.519> freely<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:46.790> I'm<00:02:47.790> open<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> space

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
moving freely and I'm open the space

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.559 
moving freely and I'm open the space
technology<00:02:51.410> front<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.700> stop<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:56.280> loop

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
technology front like this stop the loop

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.530 
technology front like this stop the loop
