00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
game is old enough it doesn't even need

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.060 
game is old enough it doesn't even need
a<00:00:13.950> 3d<00:00:14.790> card<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.389> run<00:00:15.599> you're<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.440> missing<00:00:16.890> lots

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
a 3d card to run you're not missing lots

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.519 
a 3d card to run you're not missing lots
of<00:00:17.279> fine<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.910> details<00:00:18.420> at<00:00:18.660> low<00:00:18.840> resolution

of fine little details at low resolution
but<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.279> keep<00:00:20.580> getting<00:00:20.789> requests<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.600> so

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
attention span so I'll keep this simple

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.870 
attention span so I'll keep this simple
send<00:00:28.199> me<00:00:28.320> money<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.920> I'll<00:00:29.369> increase<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.190 
things motion blur and the source engine
let's<00:00:54.280> start<00:00:54.550> with<00:00:54.670> motion<00:00:55.090> blur<00:00:55.120> what<00:00:55.840> is<00:00:55.990> it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
let's start with motion blur what is it

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.870 
let's start with motion blur what is it
well<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:56.980> now<00:00:57.130> our<00:00:57.310> eyes<00:00:57.520> perceive

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
well it's now our eyes perceive

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.990 
well it's now our eyes perceive
real-life<00:00:58.660> things<00:00:59.020> when<00:00:59.260> they<00:00:59.380> move<00:00:59.620> I<00:01:00.000> love

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
real-life things when they move I love

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.610 
real-life things when they move I love
this<00:01:01.240> effect<00:01:01.690> it<00:01:01.900> makes<00:01:02.080> everything<00:01:02.440> look

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
this effect it makes everything look

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.829 
this effect it makes everything look

more fluid and real to me here's the

game supports motion blur that's always
on<00:01:28.080> yet<00:01:29.080> I've<00:01:29.320> been<00:01:29.530> adding<00:01:29.680> motion<00:01:30.100> blur<00:01:30.250> to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
on yet I've been adding motion blur to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.490 
on yet I've been adding motion blur to
Freeman's<00:01:30.820> mind<00:01:30.880> since<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.390> beginning<00:01:31.810> how

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
Freeman's mind since the beginning how

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.859 
Freeman's mind since the beginning how
have<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:32.800> done<00:01:32.830> this<00:01:33.190> well<00:01:33.970> motion<00:01:34.420> blur<00:01:34.600> works

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
have I done this well motion blur works

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.380 
have I done this well motion blur works
kind<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.229> like<00:01:35.290> anti<00:01:35.770> aliasing<00:01:36.400> it<00:01:36.910> smooths

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
kind of like anti aliasing it smooths

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.719 
kind of like anti aliasing it smooths
out<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.869> averages<00:01:38.440> your<00:01:38.619> image<00:01:38.920> except<00:01:39.580> it's

more frames Freeman's mind plays at 30
frames<00:01:49.450> per<00:01:49.810> second<00:01:50.229> but<00:01:50.350> I<00:01:50.679> record<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.700> at<00:01:51.850> a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
input and predicts motion factors so it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.270 
input and predicts motion factors so it
looks<00:01:58.660> slick<00:01:58.990> as<00:01:59.140> hell<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.950> way<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.130> don't

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
looks slick as hell that way I don't

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.430 
looks slick as hell that way I don't
have<00:02:00.460> any<00:02:00.670> frame<00:02:01.060> blending<00:02:01.330> ghosting<00:02:02.050> nobody

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.609 
have any frame blending ghosting nobody
wants<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.830> now<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:03.819> do<00:02:04.060> not<00:02:04.660> record<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.380> in

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
wants that now I do not record this in

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.919 
wants that now I do not record this in
real<00:02:05.890> time<00:02:06.160> if<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.880> did<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.509> would<00:02:07.600> have

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
real time if I did that I would have

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:08.940 
real time if I did that I would have
dropped<00:02:08.229> frames

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
dropped frames

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.240 
dropped frames
I<00:02:09.100> hate<00:02:09.850> drop<00:02:10.300> frames<00:02:10.720> if<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.590> ever<00:02:11.770> see<00:02:12.069> this

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
I hate drop frames if you ever see this

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.670 
I hate drop frames if you ever see this
on<00:02:12.520> one<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.700> my<00:02:12.880> videos<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.750> not<00:02:14.050> me<00:02:14.319> it's

on one of my videos it's not me it's

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.190 
on one of my videos it's not me it's
probably<00:02:15.160> YouTube<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:16.510> one<00:02:16.960> nice<00:02:17.170> thing

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

anything<00:02:24.390> problem<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:26.020> method<00:02:26.410> is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
anything problem is that method is

anything problem is that method is
pretty<00:02:26.800> damn<00:02:27.130> slow<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.209> what<00:02:28.540> Freeman's

pretty damn slow this is what Freeman's
mind<00:02:29.050> looks<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:29.980> recording

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
mind looks like when recording

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
mind looks like when recording
low<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:35.500> where<00:02:35.650> things<00:02:35.860> get<00:02:36.069> really<00:02:36.280> slow<00:02:37.030> is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
low now where things get really slow is

thanks<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.940> our<00:02:42.970> friend<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.930> source<00:02:44.230> engine

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
thanks to our friend the source engine

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.949 
thanks to our friend the source engine
now<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.340> old<00:02:45.640> copy<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.209> half-life<00:02:46.600> source

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
now the old copy of half-life source

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.410 
now the old copy of half-life source
does<00:02:47.530> support<00:02:48.010> video<00:02:48.370> compression<00:02:48.760> using<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
does support video compression using the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.740 
does support video compression using the
avi<00:02:49.840> format<00:02:50.069> but<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.189> has<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.700> big<00:02:52.150> limitation

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
avi format but it has a big limitation

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.020 
avi format but it has a big limitation
in<00:02:53.230> how<00:02:53.379> large<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.860> videos<00:02:54.220> can<00:02:54.489> be

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
in how large the videos can be

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.110 
in how large the videos can be
so<00:02:55.330> much<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> can't<00:02:56.140> even<00:02:56.260> use<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.860> valve<00:02:57.850> has

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so much so I can't even use it valve has

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.390 
so much so I can't even use it valve has
not<00:02:58.390> yet<00:02:58.750> updated<00:02:59.350> their<00:02:59.500> code<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.920> fix<00:03:00.160> this

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
not yet updated their code to fix this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.650 
not yet updated their code to fix this
even<00:03:01.150> though<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.480> fix<00:03:01.750> came<00:03:02.020> out<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.850> 1996<00:03:03.850> but

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
even though the fix came out in 1996 but

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.870 
even though the fix came out in 1996 but
hey<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.230> source<00:03:05.500> engine<00:03:05.770> is<00:03:06.160> based<00:03:06.430> off<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
hey the source engine is based off the
