background the school built these
tunnels<00:01:06.119> because<00:01:06.270> during<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> winter<00:01:07.290> where

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tunnels because during the winter where

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.020 
tunnels because during the winter where
I<00:01:07.619> went<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> school<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.000> really

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
I went to school it would get really

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.230 
I went to school it would get really
really<00:01:09.510> cold<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.010> snow<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
really cold and it was snow a lot it's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
really cold and it was snow a lot it's
kind<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> reason<00:01:12.990> why<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.710> don't

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
kind of the reason why I really don't

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.090 
kind of the reason why I really don't
like<00:01:14.280> snow<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.619> one<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.770> tunnels

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like snow now but one of these tunnels

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
like snow now but one of these tunnels
led<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.460> abandon<00:01:18.180> gym<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> them<00:01:19.320> was

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
led to abandon gym one of them was

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.780 
led to abandon gym one of them was
incomplete<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.189> another<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.729> ran<00:01:21.479> under<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
incomplete and another one ran under the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
incomplete and another one ran under the
underground<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.970> guess<00:01:24.150> across<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> street<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
underground I guess across the street to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
underground I guess across the street to
this<00:01:25.409> computer<00:01:25.799> lab<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.549> quite<00:01:26.790> useful

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
this computer lab it was quite useful

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.880 
this computer lab it was quite useful
you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.509> especially<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.320> classes<00:01:28.860> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you know especially if your classes in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
you know especially if your classes in
the<00:01:29.220> direction<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> computer<00:01:30.329> lab<00:01:30.509> was

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the direction where the computer lab was

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
the direction where the computer lab was
I<00:01:30.990> mean<00:01:31.380> kinda<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.799> run<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.430> avoiding

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I mean kinda like run they're avoiding

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
I mean kinda like run they're avoiding
the<00:01:33.420> cold<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.470> definitely<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.130> if

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the cold it was definitely the way if

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
the cold it was definitely the way if
you<00:01:35.670> wanted<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> rock<00:01:36.240> sandals<00:01:36.780> during<00:01:37.020> the
