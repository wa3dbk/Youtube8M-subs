00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
was do or die at that moment where I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.020

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
think well what do I even go like if I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.789 
think well what do I even go like if I
paddle<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.420> shoulder<00:02:17.750> I'll<00:02:17.870> get<00:02:18.049> axed<00:02:18.410> by<00:02:18.590> him

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799

so<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.400> just<00:02:19.430> went<00:02:19.670> deep<00:02:20.060> into<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.360> pit<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so I just went deep into the pit and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.960 
so I just went deep into the pit and
then<00:02:21.250> ended<00:02:22.250> up<00:02:22.340> taking<00:02:22.549> out<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:22.849> us
