we<00:00:08.760> will<00:00:08.880> get<00:00:09.030> here<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.450> video<00:00:09.630> may<00:00:09.929> be

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
we will get here in this video may be

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.629 
we will get here in this video may be
showing<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> few<00:00:10.559> benchmark<00:00:11.010> applications

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
showing you a few benchmark applications

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.539 
showing you a few benchmark applications
running<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.090> HTC<00:00:12.540> One<00:00:12.960> m8<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.590> we're<00:00:14.400> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
running on the HTC One m8 and we're just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.129 
running on the HTC One m8 and we're just
gonna<00:00:14.639> see<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:14.910> well<00:00:15.120> they<00:00:15.299> perform<00:00:15.660> skits

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
gonna see how well they perform skits

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.779 
gonna see how well they perform skits
got<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.470> new<00:00:16.650> Snapdragon<00:00:16.980> 801<00:00:17.490> processor

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
got the new Snapdragon 801 processor

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
got the new Snapdragon 801 processor
clocked<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.930> at<00:00:19.050> two<00:00:19.230> point<00:00:19.529> three<00:00:19.590> gigahertz

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
clocked in at two point three gigahertz

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
clocked in at two point three gigahertz
so<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.060> should<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.240> pretty<00:00:21.359> fast<00:00:22.010> first<00:00:23.010> off

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
so it should be pretty fast first off

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.160 
so it should be pretty fast first off
we're<00:00:23.400> gonna<00:00:23.460> run<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.910> 22<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> show

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we're gonna run and 22 and just to show

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.150 
we're gonna run and 22 and just to show
you<00:00:28.320> there's<00:00:28.619> no<00:00:28.740> other<00:00:28.920> running

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you there's no other running

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.529 
you there's no other running
applications<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> background<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
applications in the background this is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.850 
applications in the background this is
the<00:00:30.689> only<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.050> um<00:00:33.140> I'm<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> test<00:00:34.680> it

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
the only one um I'm going to test it

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.940 
the only one um I'm going to test it
right<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:37.530> run<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> full<00:00:37.980> test<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> testing

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
right now we run a full test so testing

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.440 
right now we run a full test so testing
and<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> let<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> test<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and we're going to let that test and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
and we're going to let that test and
we'll<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.780> back<00:00:43.040> alright<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.700> test<00:00:44.969> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
we'll be back alright so the test is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
we'll be back alright so the test is
done<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> results<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:47.460> in

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
done and the results are in it got in

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.670 
done and the results are in it got in
antutu<00:00:48.239> benchmark<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.020> were<00:00:49.170> 30<00:00:50.539> 4020<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
antutu benchmark you were 30 4020 is you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.400 
antutu benchmark you were 30 4020 is you
see<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.280> under<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.789> note<00:00:54.329> 3<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
see it's just under the note 3 and the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.849 
see it's just under the note 3 and the
note<00:00:55.559> freeze<00:00:55.829> got<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> 800<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.969> equal<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> 80<00:00:57.420> 1

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
note freeze got the 800 is equal to 80 1

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.080 
note freeze got the 800 is equal to 80 1
but<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> no<00:00:59.399> fees<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.850> slightly

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
but you see the no fees just slightly

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
but you see the no fees just slightly
ahead<00:01:00.270> maybe<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:00.960> another<00:01:01.320> test<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.710> might

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
ahead maybe if I do another test I might

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.380 
ahead maybe if I do another test I might
get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> test

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
get a bit more about this is the test

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
get a bit more about this is the test
I've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.619> behind<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.010> Z<00:01:05.189> ultra<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I've got and just behind the Z ultra and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
I've got and just behind the Z ultra and
this<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> previous<00:01:07.260> HTC<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.890> way<00:01:08.159> down

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this for a previous HTC one is way down

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
this for a previous HTC one is way down
there<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> big<00:01:09.570> improvement<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
there so there's a big improvement in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
there so there's a big improvement in
terms<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> speed<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> next<00:01:15.000> we're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> run

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
terms of speed so next we're gonna run

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.140 
terms of speed so next we're gonna run
into<00:01:16.020> 3d<00:01:16.500> mark<00:01:16.740> I've<00:01:17.100> done<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> test<00:01:17.970> already

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
into 3d mark I've done the test already

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
into 3d mark I've done the test already
so<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.840> has<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.380> long<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so this has take pretty long to do so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
so this has take pretty long to do so
i'm<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> show<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> results

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
i'm just going to show you the results

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
i'm just going to show you the results
so<00:01:22.110> we're<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.409> wait<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
so we're just gonna wait for this to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.670 
so we're just gonna wait for this to
load<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.369> properly<00:01:23.670> i<00:01:24.080> run<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> ice<00:01:25.439> storm

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
load up properly i run the ice storm

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
load up properly i run the ice storm
unlimited<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> extreme<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.740> nice<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
unlimited and the extreme one a nice to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.899 
unlimited and the extreme one a nice to
my<00:01:29.070> limit<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.700> 18,000<00:01:30.710> 319<00:01:31.909> hopefully

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
my limit I got 18,000 319 hopefully

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.300 
my limit I got 18,000 319 hopefully
consider<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.479> step<00:01:33.990> onto<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> get

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
consider right step onto that so you get

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.319 
consider right step onto that so you get
the<00:01:35.400> full<00:01:35.430> results<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.650> see<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.329> I'll

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the full results you can see what I'll

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.429 
the full results you can see what I'll
call<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.780> each<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> score<00:01:43.079> I've

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
call in each one so you got score I've

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.280 
call in each one so you got score I've
got<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> graphics<00:01:44.130> core<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> 18,000

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
got the graphics core which is 18,000

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.030 
got the graphics core which is 18,000
731<00:01:46.610> physics<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.030> 17,000<00:01:49.369> 294<00:01:50.570> graphics

731 physics go with 17,000 294 graphics
test<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:54.090> 104<00:01:54.930> frames<00:01:55.320> per<00:01:55.470> second<00:01:55.829> test

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
test one was 104 frames per second test

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.639 
test one was 104 frames per second test
two<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.250> 66<00:01:56.909> frames<00:01:57.149> per<00:01:57.240> second<00:01:57.630> physics<00:01:58.229> test

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
two is 66 frames per second physics test

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.149 
two is 66 frames per second physics test
was<00:01:58.829> 54<00:01:59.369> frames<00:01:59.670> per<00:01:59.759> second<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.390> yeah<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.829> is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
was 54 frames per second so yeah this is

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.590 
was 54 frames per second so yeah this is
what<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> results<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.969> pretty<00:02:03.270> good<00:02:03.479> results

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
what the results are pretty good results

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.639 
what the results are pretty good results
and<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> ice<00:02:05.549> storm<00:02:05.820> extreme<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.649> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and in the ice storm extreme one it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.249 
and in the ice storm extreme one it
pretty<00:02:07.860> much<00:02:07.950> max<00:02:08.340> everything<00:02:09.000> how<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.810> see

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pretty much max everything how you see

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.520 
pretty much max everything how you see
all

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
all

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.890 
all
the<00:02:10.649> tests<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.490> just<00:02:12.060> basically<00:02:12.360> maxed<00:02:12.780> out

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the tests are just basically maxed out

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.710 
the tests are just basically maxed out
so<00:02:13.110> pretty<00:02:14.069> good<00:02:14.220> results<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.800> test<00:02:17.720> so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
so pretty good results in this test so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.830 
so pretty good results in this test so
we're<00:02:19.590> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.270> close<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.569> we're

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
we're going to close this and we're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
we're going to close this and we're
going<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.020> jump<00:02:22.260> into<00:02:22.470> quadrant<00:02:23.160> standard<00:02:23.220> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
going to jump into quadrant standard and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.150 
going to jump into quadrant standard and
I<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> run<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.780> before<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
I have a run this before so this is the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
I have a run this before so this is the
first<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:26.520> I'm<00:02:26.670> running<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.840> get<00:02:28.020> to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
first time I'm running it and you get to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.220 
first time I'm running it and you get to
see<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.470> for<00:02:28.620> yourself<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:30.020> let's<00:02:31.020> wait<00:02:31.200> for

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
see this for yourself so let's wait for

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
see this for yourself so let's wait for
this<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> finish<00:02:32.209> I'm<00:02:33.209> getting<00:02:33.330> about<00:02:33.480> 60

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
this to finish I'm getting about 60

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.059 
this to finish I'm getting about 60
frames<00:02:34.140> per<00:02:34.200> second<00:02:34.620> now<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.410> test<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
frames per second now I know the test is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
frames per second now I know the test is
dropping<00:02:38.400> down<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:38.790> bit<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:40.050> more

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
dropping down a little bit but it's more

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.800 
dropping down a little bit but it's more
or<00:02:40.350> less<00:02:40.380> getting<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.890> solid<00:02:41.100> 60<00:02:41.550> frames

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.140 

and<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> test<00:02:49.069> is<00:02:49.220> finished<00:02:49.400> pretty<00:02:50.000> quick

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and the test is finished pretty quick

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.290 
and the test is finished pretty quick
test<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.250> I've<00:02:52.250> got<00:02:52.670> 20<00:02:54.250> 4249<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.090> test

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
test and I've got 20 4249 but it's test

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.990 
test and I've got 20 4249 but it's test
which<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.020> pretty<00:02:57.290> good<00:02:57.550> results<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.730> see

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
which is pretty good results you can see

performs<00:04:22.610> them<00:04:22.790> with<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.150> application<00:04:23.690> and

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
performs them with the application and

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.720 
performs them with the application and
yeah<00:04:24.410> this<00:04:24.650> has<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:24.889> been<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.130> quick<00:04:25.520> video
