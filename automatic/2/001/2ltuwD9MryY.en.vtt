here this first time I've seen this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:54.399 
here this first time I've seen this
thing<00:00:52.549> this<00:00:52.699> must<00:00:52.879> be<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.059> like<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:53.720> one<00:00:54.229> of<00:00:54.260> your

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
thing this must be a like in one of your

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.289 
thing this must be a like in one of your
initial<00:00:54.769> revisions<00:00:55.159> of<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.309> Mega<00:00:56.119> Drive

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
initial revisions of the Mega Drive

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.090 
initial revisions of the Mega Drive
controller<00:00:56.659> before<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.379> d-pad<00:00:57.650> directions

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
controller before the d-pad directions

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.560 
controller before the d-pad directions
there<00:00:58.369> and<00:00:58.909> over<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.150> other<00:00:59.269> side<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
there and over the other side of the

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.780 
there and over the other side of the
buttons<00:00:59.869> so<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.799> course<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.190> bought<00:01:01.489> two<00:01:01.640> books

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
buttons so of course we bought two books

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.890 
buttons so of course we bought two books
about<00:01:01.879> together<00:01:02.239> if<00:01:02.360> you've<00:01:02.449> never<00:01:02.510> seen<00:01:02.750> one

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
about together if you've never seen one

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.390 
about together if you've never seen one
like<00:01:02.989> this<00:01:03.049> before<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.440> like<00:01:03.650> wall<00:01:03.830> which

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
like this before you like wall which

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.280 
like this before you like wall which
we're<00:01:04.610> arms<00:01:04.879> again<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:05.750> can<00:01:05.869> only<00:01:05.900> go<00:01:06.080> one

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
we're arms again but it can only go one

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.130 
we're arms again but it can only go one
way<00:01:06.400> because<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.549> mountains<00:01:08.030> here<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.540> you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
way because of the mountains here so you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.650 
way because of the mountains here so you
put<00:01:09.710> those<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.250> place<00:01:10.430> first<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.270> obviously

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
put those in place first and obviously

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.420 
put those in place first and obviously
it<00:01:12.440> was<00:01:12.590> apparent<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.790> d-pad<00:01:14.360> then<00:01:14.960> goes

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
it was apparent that the d-pad then goes

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.200 
it was apparent that the d-pad then goes
this<00:01:16.430> way<00:01:16.870> and<00:01:18.100> it's<00:01:19.100> inverted<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.970> know<00:01:20.090> so

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
this way and it's inverted you know so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.180 
this way and it's inverted you know so
if<00:01:20.300> you<00:01:20.390> push<00:01:20.720> up<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:21.680> factory<00:01:21.980> that<00:01:22.010> goes

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
if you push up it the factory that goes

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.650 
if you push up it the factory that goes
down<00:01:22.400> here<00:01:22.460> me<00:01:22.910> should<00:01:23.030> press<00:01:23.180> left<00:01:23.390> because

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
down here me should press left because

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.710 
down here me should press left because
my<00:01:23.690> head<00:01:24.050> cetera<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.040> via<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:25.700> will<00:01:26.480> top<00:01:26.690> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
my head cetera and via this will top the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.930 
my head cetera and via this will top the
gear<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:27.980> interested<00:01:28.460> but<00:01:28.670> that's<00:01:28.850> the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
gear so it's interested but that's the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.530 
gear so it's interested but that's the
first<00:01:29.060> time<00:01:29.180> l<00:01:29.360> have<00:01:29.390> seen<00:01:29.690> them<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.270> there<00:01:32.480> you

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
first time l have seen them so there you

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.260 
first time l have seen them so there you
go<00:01:32.630> after<00:01:32.840> 10<00:01:33.140> minutes<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.440> work<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.580> do<00:01:35.120> it<00:01:35.180> as

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
go after 10 minutes of work and do it as

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.050 
go after 10 minutes of work and do it as
new<00:01:35.500> walks<00:01:36.500> fantastic<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:37.880> works

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
new walks fantastic and it works

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.910 
new walks fantastic and it works
perfectly<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:38.840> well<00:01:39.110> yeah<00:01:39.409> pretty<00:01:39.620> sure<00:01:39.740> was

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
think up here Paul to the cable and it's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.020 
think up here Paul to the cable and it's
really<00:01:51.620> dirty<00:01:51.800> this<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.280> I'm<00:01:52.550> not<00:01:52.790> sure<00:01:52.909> how

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the would say spark cleaner where and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.850 
the would say spark cleaner where and
reassembly<00:02:58.750> well<00:02:59.750> usual<00:03:00.140> thing<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.650> key<00:03:00.770> on

reassembly well usual thing in a key on
single<00:03:01.130> back<00:03:01.280> you've<00:03:01.520> got<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.849> a<00:03:01.880> little

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
single back you've got to know a little

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.600 
single back you've got to know a little
bit<00:03:02.420> more<00:03:02.569> about<00:03:02.750> oddities<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.709> through<00:03:04.520> I

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
bit more about oddities and through I

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.190 
bit more about oddities and through I
think<00:03:04.760> added<00:03:05.030> some<00:03:05.180> six<00:03:05.480> board<00:03:05.720> controllers

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
think added some six board controllers

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.699 
think added some six board controllers
and<00:03:06.380> also<00:03:06.620> fitted<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.220> another<00:03:08.470> 3<00:03:09.470> button

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and also fitted and another 3 button

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.229 
and also fitted and another 3 button
controller<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.610> about<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.120> moving

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
controller so really about just moving

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.100 
controller so really about just moving
videos<00:03:11.690> out

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
videos out

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.199 
videos out
I<00:03:12.140> did<00:03:12.560> all<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> same<00:03:13.010> things<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.550> you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
know I spot on the board

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.600 
know I spot on the board
what's<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.400> must<00:03:16.640> pass<00:03:17.060> over<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.599> center<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
what's up must pass over the center it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.720 
what's up must pass over the center it
should<00:03:19.970> report<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.900> fact<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.800> was

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
know treats it with hot steps but result

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.780 
know treats it with hot steps but result
is<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.580> multiply<00:03:31.150> scratches<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.739> do<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> one

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
is we multiply scratches and do it one

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.900 
is we multiply scratches and do it one
