and it's random move taking pictures by

and it's random move taking pictures by
itself

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.390 

can't<00:01:12.729> really<00:01:12.939> hear<00:01:13.150> in<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.479> GoPro<00:01:13.840> audio<00:01:14.400> but

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
can't really hear in the GoPro audio but

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.870 
can't really hear in the GoPro audio but
at<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> same<00:01:16.360> time<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.860> LED<00:01:18.340> starts

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
at the same time that the LED starts

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.050 
at the same time that the LED starts
flashing<00:01:18.970> like<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.950> copter<00:01:21.250> itself<00:01:21.759> is

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
flashing like this that copter itself is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.090 
flashing like this that copter itself is
also<00:01:22.509> making<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.960> rapid<00:01:23.350> beeping<00:01:23.799> sound

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
also making the rapid beeping sound

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.630 
also making the rapid beeping sound
something<00:01:24.549> may<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.759> baby<00:01:25.119> baby<00:01:25.299> baby<00:01:25.509> beep

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
something may be baby baby baby beep

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.090 
something may be baby baby baby beep
they<00:01:27.640> both<00:01:27.880> start<00:01:28.390> at<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:29.170> exact<00:01:29.500> same<00:01:29.740> time

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
they both start at the exact same time

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.039 
they both start at the exact same time
so<00:01:30.130> somehow<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.030> think<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.630> they're<00:01:31.780> related

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
so somehow I think that they're related

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.100 
so somehow I think that they're related
and<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:35.649> just<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.280> stiff<00:01:37.210> little<00:01:37.390> test<00:01:37.659> here<00:01:37.780> in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
and so just a stiff little test here in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.109 
and so just a stiff little test here in
the<00:01:38.170> yard<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.799> kind<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.190> show<00:01:39.729> what<00:01:40.030> I'm

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
the yard to kind of show what I'm

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.090 
the yard to kind of show what I'm
experiencing<00:01:40.869> it's<00:01:41.500> really<00:01:41.680> hard<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.070> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
experiencing it's really hard to see the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.580 
experiencing it's really hard to see the
LCD<00:01:42.700> screen<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:43.090> see<00:01:43.659> that<00:01:43.869> it's<00:01:44.049> randomly

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
LCD screen and see that it's randomly

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.029 
LCD screen and see that it's randomly
taking<00:01:44.920> shots<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:47.530> didn't<00:01:47.770> use<00:01:47.890> to

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
taking shots but it is it didn't use to

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.520 
taking shots but it is it didn't use to
do<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:49.360> didn't<00:01:49.929> used<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:51.000> flash<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.530> kind

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
do this it didn't used to flash and kind

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.930 
do this it didn't used to flash and kind
of<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.039> mind<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.340> its<00:01:54.429> own

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
of have a mind of its own

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.380 
of have a mind of its own
used<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.450> work<00:01:56.229> perfectly<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:58.060> copter

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
used to work perfectly and the copter

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.109 
used to work perfectly and the copter
didn't<00:01:58.690> use<00:01:58.899> to<00:01:59.200> beep<00:02:00.009> when<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.369> would<00:02:00.520> fly<00:02:00.729> and

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
didn't use to beep when I would fly and

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.180 
didn't use to beep when I would fly and
now<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.869> happens<00:02:02.140> every<00:02:02.350> single<00:02:02.470> time<00:02:02.649> happens

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
now it happens every single time happens

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.960 
now it happens every single time happens

on full charge battery happens at the
moment<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.690> copter<00:02:08.110> has<00:02:08.440> enough<00:02:08.799> power

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
moment that the copter has enough power

that's on the roll axes and I also

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.220 
that's on the roll axes and I also
replaced<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.340> gear<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.870> little

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
replaced the the gear on the little

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.930 
replaced the the gear on the little

servo with a 72 2 servo gear and seeing

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.280 
servo with a 72 2 servo gear and seeing
better<00:03:55.209> performance<00:03:55.870> than<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.140> was

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
better performance than I was

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.979 
better performance than I was
experiencing<00:03:56.890> before<00:03:57.390> I'd<00:03:58.390> say<00:03:58.630> it's<00:03:58.780> still

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
experiencing before I'd say it's still

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.900 
experiencing before I'd say it's still
not<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.230> hundred<00:03:59.440> percent<00:03:59.560> perfect<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.640> is

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
not a hundred percent perfect but is

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.449 
not a hundred percent perfect but is
significantly<00:04:01.540> better<00:04:01.720> than<00:04:01.870> before<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.400> I'm

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
significantly better than before so I'm

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.940 
significantly better than before so I'm
pretty<00:04:03.610> happy<00:04:03.880> with<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:05.440> was<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> kit

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
pretty happy with that this was a kit

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.670 
pretty happy with that this was a kit
that<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.340> got<00:04:06.610> from<00:04:06.820> a<00:04:06.940> website<00:04:07.360> called<00:04:07.690> 1001

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
that I got from a website called 1001

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.430 
that I got from a website called 1001
copters<00:04:09.310> comm<00:04:10.030> there<00:04:10.570> in<00:04:10.840> France

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.280 

the<00:04:14.400> kit<00:04:14.580> also<00:04:14.760> came<00:04:15.270> with<00:04:15.300> another<00:04:15.990> part

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
the kit also came with another part

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.310 
the kit also came with another part
which<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.530> did<00:04:16.739> not<00:04:16.769> use<00:04:17.190> which<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> 7.2<00:04:18.900> volt

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
which I did not use which is a 7.2 volt

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.670 
which I did not use which is a 7.2 volt
dec<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.400> power<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.820> roll<00:04:21.000> servo<00:04:21.480> I<00:04:22.110> haven't

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
dec the power the roll servo I haven't

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.890 
dec the power the roll servo I haven't
tried<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:22.950> yet<00:04:23.220> they<00:04:23.640> say<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.180> won't<00:04:24.330> fry<00:04:24.690> your

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
tried it yet they say it won't fry your

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.240 
tried it yet they say it won't fry your
Saavik<00:04:25.350> servo<00:04:25.830> but<00:04:26.760> I'm<00:04:27.450> skeptical<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:28.830> I

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
Saavik servo but I'm skeptical and so I

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.710 
Saavik servo but I'm skeptical and so I
haven't<00:04:29.700> tried<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.030> yet<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.420> don't<00:04:30.600> know<00:04:30.690> I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
haven't tried it yet I don't know I

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.880 
haven't tried it yet I don't know I
might<00:04:31.260> still<00:04:32.040> go<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.580> as<00:04:32.760> it<00:04:33.030> seems<00:04:33.270> like

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
might still go to it as it seems like

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.560 
might still go to it as it seems like
the<00:04:34.890> wall<00:04:35.070> axes<00:04:35.550> still<00:04:35.880> could<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.180> little

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the wall axes still could be a little

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870 
the wall axes still could be a little
more<00:04:36.780> responsible<00:04:37.740> now<00:04:38.280> you're<00:04:38.460> about<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.730> see

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880

people<00:05:16.539> does<00:05:16.690> look<00:05:16.900> pretty<00:05:17.289> good<00:05:17.560> as<00:05:17.710> far<00:05:17.740> as

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
the stability of it goes

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.140 
the stability of it goes
definitely<00:05:19.900> compared<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.289> before<00:05:20.880> doing<00:05:21.880> some

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
definitely compared to before doing some

kind of erratic flying here

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.620 
kind of erratic flying here
seen<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> lot<00:05:24.580> of<00:05:24.610> rolling<00:05:24.940> shutter<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.419> things

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
seen a lot of rolling shutter and things

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.230 
seen a lot of rolling shutter and things
like<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.340> one<00:05:27.340> thing<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.639> am<00:05:27.699> still<00:05:27.970> seeing

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
like that one thing I am still seeing

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.520 
like that one thing I am still seeing
too<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:30.690> still<00:05:31.690> getting<00:05:31.870> quite<00:05:32.169> a<00:05:32.199> bit<00:05:32.380> of

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
too is still getting quite a bit of

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.529 
too is still getting quite a bit of
vibration<00:05:33.069> at<00:05:33.699> least<00:05:33.880> that's<00:05:34.060> what<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.270> think

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
vibration at least that's what I think

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.580 
vibration at least that's what I think
I'm<00:05:34.690> seeing<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.169> the<00:05:35.229> video

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590

I'm seeing in the video
I<00:05:36.360> don't<00:05:37.360> really<00:05:37.509> know<00:05:37.750> 10%<00:05:38.530> what<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.490> what<00:05:40.360> to

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
I don't really know 10% what to what to

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.670 
I don't really know 10% what to what to
do<00:05:40.599> about<00:05:40.720> it<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:43.090> don't<00:05:43.660> know<00:05:43.840> if<00:05:43.960> changing<00:05:44.590> to

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
do about it I don't know if changing to

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.350 
do about it I don't know if changing to
a<00:05:44.710> different<00:05:44.800> style<00:05:45.220> crop<00:05:45.610> so<00:05:46.030> if<00:05:46.150> there's

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
a different style crop so if there's

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.020 
a different style crop so if there's
some<00:05:46.539> way<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.690> dampen<00:05:47.259> the<00:05:47.289> vibrations<00:05:48.039> but

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
some way to dampen the vibrations but

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.089 
some way to dampen the vibrations but

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
little test in my backyard and this is

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.469 
little test in my backyard and this is
what<00:05:53.770> I'm<00:05:53.889> getting<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:56.310> quite<00:05:57.310> frankly

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
what I'm getting and quite frankly

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.409 
what I'm getting and quite frankly
compared<00:05:58.479> to<00:05:58.539> what<00:05:58.660> I'm<00:05:58.780> seeing<00:05:59.020> other<00:05:59.889> people

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
know results I desire better quality

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.430

that's<00:06:04.419> why<00:06:04.599> I'm<00:06:04.720> trying<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.139> do<00:06:05.289> these

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
that's why I'm trying to do these

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.459 
that's why I'm trying to do these
improvements

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.469 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.499
