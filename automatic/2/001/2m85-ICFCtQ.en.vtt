00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.770
 the icaunais coach the second part 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 the comment this up 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 per 100 users of the month 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.329
 at the edge of the device 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.399
 to increase the contrast 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.810
 montreux claire danes bridges-of-this 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.529
 and then she adds 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.980
 Blues 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.769
 the counselor to the parents 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.960
 m double clear 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.099
 Why 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.179
 death is reporting line quit 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720
 He returns 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.210
 the oldest 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.740
 the small dots 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.040
 forward 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 to use it in the world colors 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 I wanted a little balloons 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.770
 for blue 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 Tunisia is for nothing 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 I paint leahy libaert which is on the horizon 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.990
 but I have to make sure that 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.740
 the basques part one of them is a straight line 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.690
 on the horizon 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 my top 3 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 my zimbabwe bikini 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.060
 he was a little under 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 and I add that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.000
 a few legs 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.480
 but the application developers 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.180
 on the Web 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.830
 he uses his arms 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.270
 why a sandbar 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 from the beach 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 and I add that black 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 r the sand 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.920
 then comes the club but white 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.530
 simply the same performance 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.630
 for a prince arm 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 he adds that detail review 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 it seems to me 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 but hardly the Congolese parliament 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 the doctor tips in a month 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.679
 the mix of golden words at the goal is to understand 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.059
 it's a bit of 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.779
 the mix 4 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.929
 a version of this place 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:24.919
 from trial to clear 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.609
 for that 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.129
 which is wrong 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 a European flight and sky over water 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 we will be called heaven unleashed 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.959
 jb 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.519
 from their mother 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.720
 this trip 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.420
 old 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.069
 with a small brush 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.069
 but I start with the French block first 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.119
 he adds that the light blues 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.449
 more and more clear 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.759
 montreal the bush 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 movie about boxing moreau 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.819
 laurent sambron 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 it's beautiful mixing a thought and nuclear 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.969
 the same color 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:16.939
 and after 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.409
 even better role according to the blog 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.409
 boils what drives with doing a few people 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.369
 to make butter 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:28.369
 dany leprince version black which is already his lands 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.629
 he adds it's long that I do not fight to join at all 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:39.149
 on the best french 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:40.209
 physiotherapist 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.409
 which will only increase 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.969
 and mixing the two 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.079
 show 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.359
 the replay of solesmes 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.659
 in order to 0 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.699
 illegal wood 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.779
 a moment of relaxation in nevers 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.779
 the stones the rock 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.199
 but finally 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.239
 nowhere 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.359
 distant baskets 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.029
 with a brush finally 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.029
 it is not uncommon place in parliament 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.409
 the trader 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.819
 so that's the second part 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.959
 see the party statement
