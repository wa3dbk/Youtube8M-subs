00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 is there really nothing faster well nothing 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.400
 just fine you cut the wheel 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:20.900
 center tread constantly the car and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.900
 let's see how much is enough 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.859
 past hour of knives with pasta 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 we made the cutting machine ourselves 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.040
 welding on the welding machine is wound 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 one turn of thick wire and so 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.480
 naderut flashlight in the event of a 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.090
 semi-automatic one turn 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:04.559
 thick cable and it turned out the machine for 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:14.299
 cutting tread and forest forests 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.299
 fully pro and the wheel is starting to cut 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.590
 it lies like clockwork and you try so 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.939
 so that immediately at the cut 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.340
 do not make unnecessary movements here at the exit 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:53.759
 raise up that's all 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.759
 dad fire 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.520
 until the thread there is still far to tomorrow 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.290
 put the wheels on the car and see 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.770
 cracks on how many are enough 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:40.850
 these two thousand will pass by already cool to me 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:43.550
 then but it is advisable to put back what 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:53.110
 if the shot is not old but twice 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:53.110
 murderers this yes gamba good at 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.590
 groove such
