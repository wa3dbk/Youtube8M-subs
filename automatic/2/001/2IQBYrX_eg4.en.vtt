00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the price of the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 gas stations should probably pretty much 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.480
 every driver is currently in a mood 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 spoil 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.509
 they never had to go for the liter 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 grab the diesel as deep in the bag 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.039
 but who look closely determines that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.960
 it definitely a much cheaper 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.630
 alternative is for the kilo of natural gas 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 the mineral oil companies call well and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 like 40 to 45 euro cents less 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.359
 no wonder that at this price gradient 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.910
 The use of gas vehicles also in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.469
 many transport and logistics companies 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 is discussed 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.890
 the previous criterion was then 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 usually the low range 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.290
 just 3 130 kilometers come the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 sewn vehicles from iveco scania or 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.520
 mercedes benz with a full tank 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 that there are other ways too now 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 truck manufacturer iveco and semi-trailers 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.379
 partner kÃ¶gel put under proof the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.440
 dvz editorial has now one for the first time 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.989
 gas tractor of the type stralis in 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 combination with a cng trailer 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.390
 Burtenbach during a test drive around 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 around stuttgart the clou accompanies this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.450
 combination 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.340
 thanks to the underfloor mounted 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 additional gas tanks of the trainer 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.310
 triples the reach of the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.470
 truck to almost 1000 kilometers with it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 is the natural gas variant also for the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 company interesting their vehicles 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 in the daily distribution contract 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 have to travel longer distances 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.119
 with its 330 ps is the beam 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.070
 not very generous 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.140
 motorized but he can with half 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.470
 payload so with a truck 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.299
 total weight of about 26 tons well in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.979
 traffic and also on 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.439
 He does not become slopes with it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.119
 obstacle 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.979
 also leave the trailers costs 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.350
 The driver hardly more time than one 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.960
 conventional truck gas line 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.439
 peel off pressure that was it too 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.930
 beautiful 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.369
 and when saddling everything goes exactly like that 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.960
 quickly conducted as usual 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.780
 purely from the handling speaks therefore so 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.700
 nothing against a gas truck 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.890
 two drops of power cloud the first one 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 good impression on the one hand it is only on 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 Few petrol stations are designed for trucks 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.770
 gas dispensers 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.680
 that means in clear text the driver must 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.719
 from the beginning 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.969
 schedule time when he returns to the tanks 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.890
 wants to fill the other one must 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:21.069
 In the case of the purchase, the driver 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.290
 around 50 to 60,000 eur higher 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.239
 cost price or higher 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.959
 Leasing rates for the total lorry 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.819
 count 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.590
 while the gas station problem 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.780
 about the successive expansion of the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.040
 infrastructure or by the facility 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.109
 a delivery point on the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 should solve business premises 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.560
 purchase price in the future still higher 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.920
 lie than conventional ones 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.989
 Vehicles, however, the gas truck can 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.599
 in the opinion of experts the specifications 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.359
 the euro 6 standard after going through the eu 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.000
 homologation procedure without elaborate 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.169
 fulfill exhaust aftertreatment 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.909
 He is also very quiet 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.560
 on the way so he's the strict one 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.719
 requirements for the early morning 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.250
 downtown delivery without additional 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.030
 Sound insulation can meet 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 and that is probably the case with the big ones 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.919
 Retail chains are of great interest 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.919
 bump
