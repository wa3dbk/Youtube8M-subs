00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
 [Music] 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:10.820
 my dear 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.919
 to the last topic are thick 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.390
 ugly has found or even that 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:19.099
 topic started what is beauty yes what 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.009
 is beauty in a human take 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:28.210
 I think it's nice to see a lot 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.210
 But what is beauty my people 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.500
 like me in my last one 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.550
 Video said I think is the character 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.160
 actually the most beautiful thing one 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.910
 people can make out who he is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.910
 how he is 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.899
 There is not really much to it 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:52.730
 say you can get a with make-up 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:56.030
 Certainly a certain beauty towards 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.000
 make up as I had read in the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.449
 comments at winden duda 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.679
 that can be very horny the statement 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.360
 make-up does not cover a bad one 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.860
 character and that's right 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.270
 really that is really true 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 Make up underlines right 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.479
 underscores your own beauty 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 There are also people who 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.270
 emphasize their own 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.490
 ugliness if you like it too 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.470
 okay some make up with makeup 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.400
 even uglier than us before but that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.900
 everything is a matter of taste 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:34.130
 if it beautiful I find himself 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:40.970
 Personally, yes, I think that's nice 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.170
 I think humor is nice and the partner 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.549
 For example, I think so too 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.189
 Trust that you have each other 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.040
 dealing with each other everyday that is 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.110
 something I do not think is nice of that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.009
 art but that also means mine 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.009
 partner nice for me 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 I had already mentioned that me 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.140
 All my partners ugly until I found 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.079
 she met and if they had times 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.750
 and also were nice they were for 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.220
 me attractive and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.660
 this inner these inner values 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.090
 then shine too look for the look 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 me and beautiful 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 why would you say that is beautiful who that is 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 radiates beauty stratmann 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.100
 Exhibit is not like ever 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.890
 mentioned that the outside passes that yes 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.750
 outer changes constantly and but 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.620
 how to stay that way and that's it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.520
 I radiate this beauty 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.620
 charisma is something you can do too 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.280
 Do not make-up radiation of something 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.200
 either you have it or you do not have it 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.650
 and I think everyone has it only for 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.060
 Certain people are not for everyone 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 There are some who achieve with theirs 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.010
 with their kind more people than others 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.090
 but I think there is something for everyone 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.680
 somewhere whom he works on 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.220
 Actually , every person is beautiful for 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 someone somewhere in the world and that 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.150
 I actually think nice thoughts 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.590
 every pot has its lid and some 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.630
 can not loll at all 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 I do not want to decide 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.650
 necessarily always with exchange 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.610
 Beauty is something everyone has for himself 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 Declare yourself what everyone has to 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.690
 must determine yourself what is beautiful 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.940
 because a general nice does not exist 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.620
 There is a trend 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.170
 there is something where many are more similar 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.330
 opinion are then as 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.840
 beauty ideal of time counted 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.090
 becomes 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.610
 but that too, we just think 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.860
 time to rubens I mean 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.550
 At the time it was like that there were women 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.250
 with with with burschikosen figures with 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.730
 little bust and and slightly dumpy 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.730
 It was my pleasure 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.920
 today it looks very different 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.989
 it was still at the beginning of the last century 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.000
 so that women spend a few more pounds than 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.640
 only 50 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.240
 kilo on total weight allowed to have 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.110
 if they are 1 meter 90 tall 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.790
 that changes within one 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.110
 century even remembers it 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.360
 even from continent to continent 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:37.100
 pretty in Austria, for example 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.020
 I noticed that in some 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.790
 Greater fat women I believe 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.830
 partly pretty to be felt 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:49.190
 lean in africa is a fat woman 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.750
 for example as very decorative because 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.669
 wealth means that you feel that way 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.600
 good food could be good now 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.790
 of course a bit strange 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.020
 but you can understand it in one 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.880
 land where food is not 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.630
 necessarily always in unlimited quantity 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.800
 it is available 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.110
 I understand that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.290
 beauty ideal also in the environment 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.000
 that does not really suit what you're supposed to do 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.340
 Often that's what's special 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.020
 nice and there then also means 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.490
 At the same time his wife is beautiful too 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.440
 to own enough wealth and 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.240
 That's why the attempt will be reached 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.040
 in other areas, women are very 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.330
 Bright skin is very popular in others 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.950
 areas with very dark skin tone 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.570
 as far as possible in Asian countries 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.540
 The women have especially small feet 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.070
 so that they were beautiful 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.970
 that's already stuff and partly where 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.870
 I say that's just over there 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.960
 were born 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.340
 so we are perfect in actually 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.260
 Anything else is just any form 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.650
 bauble on make-up all that just 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.600
 gimmick 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.370
 Actually we are so born again 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.710
 have been taken care of normally 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.919
 and pay a little attention to us 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:03.560
 nice and that's not necessarily 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:06.950
 a question of weight but if that 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.000
 inside is true, the outside is that 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.780
 only underlined for the 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.040
 character, so to speak 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.590
 well, now I have enough over 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.310
 Beauty is philosophizing here 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.180
 is in the evening 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.180
 See you 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:44.399
