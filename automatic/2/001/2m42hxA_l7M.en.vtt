00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.639
Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.180
Today we are gonna be making something again
Rice Krsipies because I got so many

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.330
requests after last weeks episode to do something
else Rice Krispies.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.720
You guys really, really liked it, so, we will
do it, I will do this for you guys,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.580
but, we are gonna do a different recipe.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.260
Instead of mint chocolate chip, this week
we are going to make the original Rice

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.330
Krispies recipe and, we are gonna make them
into little star pops.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.980
So they’re gonna be Rice Krispies Mario
Star Pops and I thought it was really special

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.670
because Mario Star was my first episode of
Nerdy Nummies, I did a cake!

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.489
So today, we are gonna make Mario Star Rice
Krispy Pops!

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.469
The things you will need, will be: The Kelloggs
Rice Krispies cereal, we will need

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.469
6 cups of this, baking spray, 3 tablespoons
of butter, you’re gonna need frosting,

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.410
white and black for decorating, 1 star cookie
cutter, 10 ounce bag of

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:19.110
mini marshmallows, yellow candy melts, lollipop
sticks, a 13x9 baking pan,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.880
and a foam block!

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.610
OK, I’m gonna take this little foam and
I’m gonna put him over here, we’re gonna

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.220
come back to that later, and we’re gonna
be making our rice krispies from scratch,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.289
but, ooh, look what I found!?!?

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:38.770
If you don’t have time to make them from
scratch, isn’t this crazy? It’s so big!

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.670
I found it at the store and this is just a
flat sheet of basic Rice Krispies,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.720
which you can cut the stars shapes out of
if you’re in a hurry.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.440
I found this 1 at It’s Sugar, I’ll put
a link down below if you’d like to order

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.899
some online, these are so crazy, ah!

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.009
Alright, so the first thing that we’re gonna
do to get started is we’re gonna grease

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.209
our baking pan! Gonna take a little baking
spray and spray the pan.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.800
There we go! A-ha-ha!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.860
And now we’re gonna take all of these ingredients
and head over to the stove!

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.099
The first thing that we’re gonna do is,
I’ve taken a medium sized pan,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.560
and I’ve put it on low heat, I like to keep
it on a number 2, and we’re gonna take

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.800
3 ounces of butter, put it in the pan, and
stir it around, wait for it to melt.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.700
Once your butter is completely melted, we
are gonna add the 1 bag of marshmallows.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
You’re just gonna pour all of them in, and
then continue to stir until

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.220
it’s all liquid. Now that our yummy marshmallows
are all melted, we are gonna

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.570
mix in the 6 cups of Rice Krispies cereal!

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.700
Once you’re done mixing all your Rice Krispies
in with the marshmallows, we’re

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.100
gonna pour the whole mixture into the pan.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.540
Watch out, it’s sticky!

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.250
Push it into the corners, and then, you’re
gonna take a piece of wax paper,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.500
and gently press it on the top of the pan.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.450
You’ll want to get it as flat as you can!

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.220
Once they are nice and flat we’re gonna
put them in the fridge and let them

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.850
chill for about 30 minutes!

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.069
I took my Rice Krispies out of the fridge
and I plopped it out of the pan

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.710
and I just put it on top of this cutting board
so that it’s easier for me to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.370
cut shapes out of! You’re gonna take your
star cookie cutter, just place it on

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.740
the top and cut out little stars!

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.320
Da-dew! Just like this, and then just pop
‘em out.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.900
Perfect! Right on, that’s what we want!

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.800
Once you’ve got all your little Rice Krispies
stars cut out, we are gonna stick

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.150
in all the little lollipops.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.900
So what you’re gonna do is take a lollipop
stick, dip it into melted chocolate, I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.420
just heated up a little bit of chocolate,
you can use any kind, and then stick it in!

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.780
I like to push it a little over 1/2 way in
there, but don’t go any more than that,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.650
you don’t want the stick coming out the
top, but just so it feels really firm!

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.600
Now we’re gonna do that to the rest of these
and then stick them in the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.150
freezer for about 10 minutes to chill before
we dip them into the chocolate!

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.540
I just took the star pops out of the freezer,
they’re all done cooling, and

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.060
now we’re gonna dip them into the yellow
chocolate.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.349
I’ve melted a bunch of yellow chocolate
in this bowl right here,

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.349
and just pick 1 up, and dip it in.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:21.019
Make sure to get all sides… That looks pretty
cute huh?

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.060
There we go! These are a lot more durable
than the regular cake pop, like you can

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.400
stick it in the chocolate and kinda move it
around a little bit more, so I really

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.750
like these Rice Krispies. But they aren’t
gonna be as smooth as a cake pop, because

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.650
they’re kinda bumpy, lumpy Rice Krispies,
but they still look really cute, so…

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.910
That’s what he’s gonna look like and you’re
gonna stick him over here in this

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.570
foam block… Werp!

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.270
Now you’re gonna dip the rest of your stars!

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.310
I just took the stars out of the freezer,
I put them in there for a few minutes

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.690
so they would just get really firm. And now,
we’re gonna do the last step!

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.930
We’re gonna decorate and add their little
eyeballs!

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.680
Ta-da! We did it! Here are our Mario Star
Rice Krispy Pops, they’re so cute!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.080
I love how they turned out! And Rice Krispies
are so easy to make, they’re 1 of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.350
my favorite recipes, they only take about
10 minutes to bake and then 10 minutes

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.210
to decorate, yum-yum-yum-yum-yum!

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.100
It was the perfect thing, so thanks you guys
for suggesting another Rice Krispies.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.560

OK, thanks you guys, bye-bye!

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.940

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.360
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.720
