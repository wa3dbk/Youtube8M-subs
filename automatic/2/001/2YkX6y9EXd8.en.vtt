how to eat you darlington farm here just
over<00:00:02.639> here<00:00:02.850> at<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.090> farm<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.659> as<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.990> can<00:00:04.080> see

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
over here at the farm and as you can see

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.050 
over here at the farm and as you can see
I've<00:00:04.710> been<00:00:04.920> working<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> generator<00:00:05.759> here

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
I've been working on the generator here

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.970 
I've been working on the generator here
excuse<00:00:06.930> me<00:00:07.080> welder<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.830> not<00:00:07.950> a

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
excuse me welder here it's not a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.410 
excuse me welder here it's not a
generator<00:00:08.429> well<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> guess<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> kind<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
generator well I guess it kind of is a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.749 
generator well I guess it kind of is a
generator<00:00:09.870> um<00:00:10.260> those<00:00:10.679> fuel<00:00:10.980> lines<00:00:11.070> were<00:00:11.550> just

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
generator um those fuel lines were just

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.839 
generator um those fuel lines were just
crumbling<00:00:12.420> as<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:13.980> there<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:14.549> were

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
crumbling as you can see there they were

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.529 
crumbling as you can see there they were
just<00:00:15.199> coming<00:00:16.199> apart<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.490> think<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
just coming apart I think I'm going to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
just coming apart I think I'm going to
go<00:00:18.660> ahead<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.050> replace<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:20.100> looks<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
go ahead and replace it looks like the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.210 
go ahead and replace it looks like the
fuel<00:00:20.820> pump<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.330> runs<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.890> crankcase

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
fuel pump here runs off of the crankcase

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.429 
fuel pump here runs off of the crankcase
pressure<00:00:23.730> there's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> breather<00:00:25.019> coming<00:00:25.320> out

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
pressure there's a breather coming out

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
pressure there's a breather coming out
of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.560> side<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> crankcase<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
of the side of the crankcase there and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
of the side of the crankcase there and
up<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.750> whatever<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> assume<00:00:29.340> that

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
up to whatever that is I assume that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.880 
up to whatever that is I assume that
some<00:00:29.880> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> diaphragm<00:00:30.630> pump<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.199> think<00:00:31.800> I'm

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
some kind of diaphragm pump I think I'm

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.959 
some kind of diaphragm pump I think I'm
just<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.309> ahead<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.640> replace<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
just going to go ahead and replace that

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.160 
just going to go ahead and replace that
hose<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.870> old<00:00:34.290> fuel<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:35.130> fuel<00:00:35.280> line<00:00:35.930> came<00:00:36.930> off

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hose the old fuel or fuel line came off

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.959 
hose the old fuel or fuel line came off
the<00:00:37.320> tank<00:00:37.559> here<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.399> reason<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.820> ran

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the tank here and for some reason it ran

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
the tank here and for some reason it ran
through<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> front<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> case<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
through the front of the case on the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
through the front of the case on the
engine<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:42.149> assumed<00:00:42.420> keep<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> away

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
engine here I just assumed keep it away

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
engine here I just assumed keep it away
from<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> engine<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.950> hot<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> just

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
from the engine where it's hot so I just

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.930 
from the engine where it's hot so I just
zip<00:00:45.329> tied<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> outer<00:00:47.520> part<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
zip tied it up here to the outer part of

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
zip tied it up here to the outer part of
this<00:00:48.059> case<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.539> never<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:48.989> try<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this case I'm never gonna try and use a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.400 
this case I'm never gonna try and use a
pull<00:00:50.010> start<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.170> ran

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
pull start on this thing so I just ran

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.520 
pull start on this thing so I just ran
it<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.180> um<00:00:54.180> sloshed<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> rust

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it like that um sloshed a lot of rust

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
it like that um sloshed a lot of rust
and<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.039> junk<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> tank<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and just junk out of the tank so

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
and just junk out of the tank so
hopefully<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> will<00:00:58.039> kind<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.100> clear<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> up

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
hopefully that will kind of clear it up

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.750 
hopefully that will kind of clear it up
a<00:00:59.670> bit<00:00:59.850> put<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> new<00:01:00.180> fuel<00:01:00.359> filter<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
a bit put a new fuel filter in there I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.979 
a bit put a new fuel filter in there I
suspect<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.510> rebuild<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
suspect I'm going to have to rebuild the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.670 
suspect I'm going to have to rebuild the
carb<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> bowl<00:01:06.680> right

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
carb here if you look at the bowl right

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580 
carb here if you look at the bowl right
on<00:01:08.420> right<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> whole<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
on right there there is a whole lot of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.289 
on right there there is a whole lot of
funk<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> smells

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
funk down there on it then it smells

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.320 
funk down there on it then it smells
like<00:01:12.479> varnished<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.049> gas<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> suspect<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
like varnished up gas so I suspect the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
like varnished up gas so I suspect the
carburetor<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.990> needs<00:01:16.229> new<00:01:16.409> seals<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
carburetor just needs new seals and I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.890 
carburetor just needs new seals and I
think<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.600> ahead<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
think I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
think I'm just going to go ahead and
order<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.170> rebuild<00:01:19.590> kit<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.310> only

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
order a rebuild kit for it they're only

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
order a rebuild kit for it they're only
about<00:01:20.840> 16<00:01:21.840> bucks<00:01:22.110> plus<00:01:22.860> shipping<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:24.290> was

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
about 16 bucks plus shipping I was

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
about 16 bucks plus shipping I was
running<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:25.650> rich<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> other<00:01:26.250> day<00:01:26.549> so

running a little rich the other day so
I've<00:01:27.390> tweaked<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.250> made<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.640 
see that but there is a set screw on the
bottom<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> carb<00:01:39.540> there<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
bottom of the carb there that is for the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.090 
bottom of the carb there that is for the
main<00:01:41.490> jet<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> carburetor<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.680> idle

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
main jet for the carburetor and the idle

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
main jet for the carburetor and the idle
jet<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.840> right<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.439> side<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
jet is right here on this side of the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.850 
jet is right here on this side of the
carburetor<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.110> low<00:01:49.110> speed<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.590> great

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
carburetor but the low speed is great

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.889 
carburetor but the low speed is great
where<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.490> runs<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.180> nineteen<00:01:51.509> hundred<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
where it runs at nineteen hundred and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.130 
where it runs at nineteen hundred and
fifty<00:01:52.140> rpms<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.829> runs<00:01:52.979> great<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> high<00:01:53.520> side

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
fifty rpms it runs great the high side

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.440 
fifty rpms it runs great the high side
it's<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> stumbles<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.270> hunts<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.420> I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's kind of stumbles and hunts so I

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's kind of stumbles and hunts so I
suspect<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.290> either<00:01:58.670> starving<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.820> fuel

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
suspect it was either starving for fuel

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
suspect it was either starving for fuel
because<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.530> fuel<00:02:02.100> lines<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because of the you know fuel lines and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.420 
because of the you know fuel lines and
probably<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> suspect<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.600> clogged<00:02:03.840> filter<00:02:04.430> in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
probably I suspect a clogged filter in

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.039 
probably I suspect a clogged filter in
that<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.360> there's<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.899> some

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
that as you can see there's kind of some

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.979 
that as you can see there's kind of some
rust<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> junk<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.810> suspect<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
rust and junk in there I suspect was

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.780 
rust and junk in there I suspect was
either<00:02:10.110> starving<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.860> fuel<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.400> had<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.640> too

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
either starving for fuel or had all too

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.180 
either starving for fuel or had all too
much<00:02:11.910> fuel<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
much fuel so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.500 
much fuel so
starter<00:02:14.190> up<00:02:14.340> here<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> monkey<00:02:15.390> with

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
starter up here and kind of monkey with

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.890 
starter up here and kind of monkey with
all<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.870> picked<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:17.030> new<00:02:18.030> air<00:02:18.210> filter<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
all so I picked up a new air filter that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.410 
all so I picked up a new air filter that
I<00:02:19.200> don't<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.740> how<00:02:19.860> old<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.460> one<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.180> but

day<00:03:50.670> too<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:51.980> suspect<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.340> need<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.640> rebuild

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
day too I suspect I just need to rebuild

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:02.370 
day too I suspect I just need to rebuild
the<00:03:54.060> carburetor

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.390 

get<00:04:03.380> away<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.920> can<00:04:04.160> hear<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:06.190> anyway<00:04:07.190> I

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
get away so you can hear it anyway I

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.370 
get away so you can hear it anyway I
hope<00:04:07.550> you<00:04:07.700> enjoyed<00:04:09.280> any<00:04:10.280> advice<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.450> working

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
hope you enjoyed any advice on working

you'd<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.560> see<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:46.790> I<00:04:47.790> noticed<00:04:48.240> it

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
you'd like to see so I I noticed it

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.570 
you'd like to see so I I noticed it
didn't<00:04:49.080> occur<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.290> me<00:04:49.440> when<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.889> first<00:04:50.070> started

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
didn't occur to me when I first started

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.040 
didn't occur to me when I first started
using<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.970> thing<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.389> when<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> was<00:04:51.780> running

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
using this thing that when I was running

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.250 
using this thing that when I was running
it<00:04:52.229> my<00:04:52.350> grinders<00:04:52.889> ran<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:54.120> well<00:04:54.539> off<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:55.110> it

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
it my grinders ran really well off of it

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.850 
it my grinders ran really well off of it
I<00:04:56.810> didn't<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.990> know<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.139> didn't<00:04:58.470> really<00:04:58.680> check

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
I didn't you know I didn't really check

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.939 
I didn't you know I didn't really check
it<00:04:59.010> over<00:04:59.539> as<00:05:00.539> well<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.229> should<00:05:01.440> have<00:05:01.470> when<00:05:01.919> I

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
it over as well as I should have when I

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.189 
it over as well as I should have when I
first<00:05:02.220> got<00:05:02.400> at<00:05:02.639> home<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:03.360> probably<00:05:03.870> should<00:05:04.080> have

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
first got at home I probably should have

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.750 
first got at home I probably should have
done<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.320> better<00:05:04.470> job<00:05:04.590> checking<00:05:05.130> over<00:05:05.310> anyway

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
done a better job checking over anyway

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.939 
done a better job checking over anyway
so<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.449> plugged<00:05:06.840> my<00:05:06.930> meter<00:05:07.229> in<00:05:07.440> here<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:07.830> a

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
so I plugged my meter in here this is a

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.870 
so I plugged my meter in here this is a
fluke<00:05:09.080> 189<00:05:10.080> fairly<00:05:10.740> high-end<00:05:11.100> meter<00:05:11.610> there

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
fluke 189 fairly high-end meter there

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.330 
fluke 189 fairly high-end meter there
for<00:05:12.090> my<00:05:12.210> engineering<00:05:12.419> days<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.800> has<00:05:13.949> a<00:05:14.160> you

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
for my engineering days it has a you

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.520 
for my engineering days it has a you
know<00:05:14.370> frequency<00:05:15.030> and<00:05:15.180> pause<00:05:15.360> setting<00:05:16.350> all

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
know frequency and pause setting all

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.210 
know frequency and pause setting all
that<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:17.449> noticed<00:05:18.449> it<00:05:18.539> was<00:05:18.660> running<00:05:18.870> about<00:05:19.220> 120

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
that I noticed it was running about 120

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.360 
that I noticed it was running about 120
Hertz<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:22.229> was<00:05:22.380> putting<00:05:22.650> out<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.919> little

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
Hertz and it was putting out a little

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.960 
Hertz and it was putting out a little
over<00:05:23.699> 200<00:05:24.270> volts<00:05:24.630> on<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.500> AC<00:05:25.860> outlet<00:05:26.490> here<00:05:26.729> so

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
over 200 volts on the AC outlet here so

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.300 
over 200 volts on the AC outlet here so
it's<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.210> oh<00:05:27.360> that's<00:05:28.020> why<00:05:28.320> my<00:05:28.530> grinder<00:05:29.070> was

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
it's like oh that's why my grinder was

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.820 
it's like oh that's why my grinder was
really<00:05:29.610> running<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.630> awesome<00:05:31.200> off<00:05:31.349> of<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.650> so

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
really running just awesome off of it so

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.219 
really running just awesome off of it so
I<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.910> did<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.180> governor<00:05:33.450> down<00:05:33.780> here<00:05:34.050> it's

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
I just did the governor down here it's

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.770 
I just did the governor down here it's
supposed<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.590> be<00:05:34.740> 80<00:05:35.010> volts<00:05:35.250> open<00:05:36.120> circuit<00:05:36.599> on

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
supposed to be 80 volts open circuit on

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.279 
supposed to be 80 volts open circuit on
the<00:05:37.590> high<00:05:37.770> end<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.550> low<00:05:38.729> end<00:05:39.150> which<00:05:40.080> is

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
the high end and the low end which is

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.159 
the high end and the low end which is
the<00:05:40.530> generator<00:05:41.070> side<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.760> just<00:05:42.539> adjusted<00:05:43.050> until

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
the generator side I just adjusted until

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.260 
the generator side I just adjusted until
I<00:05:43.349> was<00:05:43.590> right<00:05:43.800> at<00:05:43.950> 60<00:05:44.280> Hertz<00:05:44.400> they're<00:05:44.849> pretty

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
I was right at 60 Hertz they're pretty

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.500 
I was right at 60 Hertz they're pretty
close<00:05:45.360> to<00:05:45.419> it<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:46.110> turned<00:05:46.889> it<00:05:47.039> up<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.910> about<00:05:48.000> 62

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
close to it I turned it up to about 62

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.210 
close to it I turned it up to about 62
Hertz<00:05:48.900> because<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.349> engine<00:05:49.650> really<00:05:49.800> smooths

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
Hertz because the engine really smooths

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.760 
Hertz because the engine really smooths
out<00:05:50.520> right<00:05:51.389> about<00:05:51.539> there<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.229> figure<00:05:52.530> that

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
out right about there so I figure that

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.240 
out right about there so I figure that
is<00:05:53.639> close<00:05:54.120> enough<00:05:54.300> but<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:55.410> know<00:05:55.500> 60<00:05:55.919> Hertz<00:05:56.070> it

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
is close enough but you know 60 Hertz it

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.370 
is close enough but you know 60 Hertz it
was<00:05:56.340> kind<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.580> vibrating<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.780> didn't

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
was kind of vibrating and I I didn't

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.750 
was kind of vibrating and I I didn't
really<00:05:58.560> like<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:58.919> so<00:05:59.099> I<00:05:59.130> just<00:05:59.370> turned<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.669> up

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
really like that so I just turned it up

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.250 
really like that so I just turned it up
a<00:05:59.880> bit<00:06:00.030> there<00:06:00.210> but<00:06:00.240> yeah<00:06:00.539> somebody's<00:06:00.960> played

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
a bit there but yeah somebody's played

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.659 
a bit there but yeah somebody's played
with<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.530> governor<00:06:01.860> on<00:06:02.070> that<00:06:02.280> at<00:06:02.460> some<00:06:02.639> point

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
with the governor on that at some point

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.659 
with the governor on that at some point
boy<00:06:03.210> it<00:06:03.389> was<00:06:03.539> really<00:06:04.070> it<00:06:05.070> was<00:06:05.160> really<00:06:05.490> making

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
boy it was really it was really making

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.089 
boy it was really it was really making
the<00:06:05.910> grinders<00:06:06.360> go<00:06:06.599> but<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.050> suspect<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:07.889> would

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
the grinders go but I suspect that would

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.680 
the grinders go but I suspect that would
really<00:06:08.400> shorten<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:08.849> life<00:06:09.060> of<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.660> I

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
really shorten the life of it and I

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.029 
really shorten the life of it and I
would<00:06:09.750> want<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.050> plug<00:06:10.320> anything<00:06:10.500> important

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
would want to plug anything important

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.129 
would want to plug anything important
into<00:06:11.280> it<00:06:11.400> but<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.789> think<00:06:12.180> I<00:06:12.330> have<00:06:12.510> it<00:06:12.690> working

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
into it but I think I have it working

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.430 
into it but I think I have it working
pretty<00:06:13.500> well<00:06:13.590> here<00:06:14.010> as<00:06:14.880> I<00:06:15.479> showed<00:06:15.720> earlier<00:06:15.990> I

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
pretty well here as I showed earlier I

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.839 
pretty well here as I showed earlier I
changed<00:06:17.039> out<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.960> fuel<00:06:19.349> filter<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.190> this

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
changed out the fuel filter and this

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.060 
changed out the fuel filter and this
fuel<00:06:21.120> line<00:06:21.360> here<00:06:21.810> I<00:06:21.930> think<00:06:22.800> I'm<00:06:22.919> going<00:06:23.010> to

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
fuel line here I think I'm going to

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.240 
fuel line here I think I'm going to
change<00:06:23.250> out<00:06:23.580> the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.100 

line<00:06:27.250> running<00:06:27.699> from<00:06:27.849> that<00:06:28.090> impulse<00:06:28.419> pump

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
line running from that impulse pump

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.499 
line running from that impulse pump
right<00:06:29.349> there<00:06:30.090> hey<00:06:31.090> Sammy

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
that fuel pump later I still am having a

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.020 
that fuel pump later I still am having a
bunch<00:06:41.259> of<00:06:41.349> crap<00:06:41.710> in<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:42.039> fuel<00:06:42.220> tank<00:06:42.250> there<00:06:42.729> so

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
bunch of crap in the fuel tank there so

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.719 
bunch of crap in the fuel tank there so
everyone<00:06:43.300> I<00:06:43.710> rinsed<00:06:44.710> it<00:06:44.770> out<00:06:44.919> and<00:06:45.190> got<00:06:45.490> a<00:06:45.520> lot

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
everyone I rinsed it out and got a lot

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.279 
everyone I rinsed it out and got a lot
of<00:06:45.789> rust<00:06:46.060> and<00:06:46.240> junk<00:06:46.539> out<00:06:46.690> of<00:06:46.840> it<00:06:46.930> but<00:06:47.080> every

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
of rust and junk out of it but every

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.710 
of rust and junk out of it but every
once<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.590> while<00:06:47.620> I<00:06:47.800> still<00:06:48.220> will<00:06:49.150> notice<00:06:49.479> there's

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
once a while I still will notice there's

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.869 
once a while I still will notice there's
some<00:06:49.990> sediment<00:06:50.650> in<00:06:50.949> the<00:06:51.009> bottom<00:06:51.190> of<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.669> so

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879 
some sediment in the bottom of this so

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.050 
some sediment in the bottom of this so
hopefully<00:06:52.180> that<00:06:52.360> will<00:06:52.509> work<00:06:52.569> its<00:06:52.900> way<00:06:53.050> out<00:06:53.080> and

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
hopefully that will work its way out and

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.480 
hopefully that will work its way out and
yeah<00:06:55.060> so<00:06:55.539> also<00:06:56.259> oh<00:06:56.440> one<00:06:56.860> other<00:06:56.979> thing<00:06:57.129> if
