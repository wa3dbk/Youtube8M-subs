00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.840 
existence but the second you look away
they'll<00:01:00.019> reappear<00:01:00.260> just<00:01:00.739> like<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.549> lilac

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.520 
terrace would be moving at 215 units per
second<00:01:23.300> if<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.600> were<00:01:23.690> holding<00:01:23.870> an<00:01:24.050> ak-47

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
second if you were holding an ak-47

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.180 
second if you were holding an ak-47
moving<00:01:25.370> at<00:01:25.460> full<00:01:25.610> velocity<00:01:26.950> now<00:01:27.950> here's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
moving at full velocity now here's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.950 
moving at full velocity now here's
another<00:01:28.250> figure<00:01:28.760> for<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.510> average<00:01:29.690> human

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
another figure for you the average human

another figure for you the average human
reaction<00:01:30.500> time<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.280> visual<00:01:31.550> stimulus<00:01:32.210> is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
reaction time to a visual stimulus is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.620 
reaction time to a visual stimulus is
210<00:01:33.170> milliseconds<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.880> just<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:35.240> happens<00:01:35.540> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
210 milliseconds it just so happens the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.649 
210 milliseconds it just so happens the
player<00:01:35.840> models<00:01:36.200> are<00:01:36.380> 26<00:01:36.830> by<00:01:36.980> 26<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.700> 72<00:01:38.360> units

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
player models are 26 by 26 and 72 units

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.850 
player models are 26 by 26 and 72 units
tall<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.909> knowing<00:01:41.150> all<00:01:41.240> these<00:01:41.390> figures<00:01:41.860> let's

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
tall so knowing all these figures let's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.100 
tall so knowing all these figures let's
do<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.130> little<00:01:43.340> investigating<00:01:43.940> so<00:01:44.900> how<00:01:44.960> much

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
do a little investigating so how much

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.450 
do a little investigating so how much
brown<00:01:45.320> can<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.680> actually<00:01:45.860> cover<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.430> that

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
brown can you actually cover in that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.090 
brown can you actually cover in that
amount<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.850> time<00:01:47.030> living<00:01:47.330> at<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.690> speed<00:01:48.100> they

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
amount of time living at that speed they

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
amount of time living at that speed they
turn<00:01:49.400> out<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:49.850> can<00:01:49.970> move<00:01:50.120> roughly<00:01:50.510> 45

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
turn out that you can move roughly 45

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.710 
turn out that you can move roughly 45
units<00:01:51.320> within<00:01:51.800> 210<00:01:52.430> milliseconds<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> from

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
units within 210 milliseconds and from

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.690 
units within 210 milliseconds and from
this<00:01:53.930> we<00:01:54.110> come<00:01:54.229> to<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.409> conclusion<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:55.159> player

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
this we come to the conclusion a player

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.000 
this we come to the conclusion a player
will<00:01:55.880> be<00:01:55.909> peaked<00:01:56.270> approximately<00:01:56.960> 1.7<00:01:57.800> body

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010
