00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.709 
thought i would talk about them on this
channel<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.550> first<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.179> we're<00:00:12.570> moving

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
channel the first is that we're moving

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.720 
channel the first is that we're moving
and<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.320> you've<00:00:13.440> been<00:00:13.530> following<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and if you've been following this for a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.369 
and if you've been following this for a
while<00:00:15.210> now<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.570> know<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.900> we've<00:00:16.170> moved

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
while now you know that we've moved

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
while now you know that we've moved
quite<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> few<00:00:16.890> times<00:00:17.039> recently<00:00:17.369> which<00:00:17.820> really

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
quite a few times recently which really

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.150 
quite a few times recently which really
stinks<00:00:18.380> especially<00:00:19.380> having<00:00:19.590> two<00:00:19.859> small

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
stinks especially having two small

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.029 
stinks especially having two small
children<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:21.449> unfortunately<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.890> moving

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
children but unfortunately we are moving

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.769 
children but unfortunately we are moving
it<00:00:23.279> again<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> hopefully<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.480> will<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
it again and hopefully this will be the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.790 
it again and hopefully this will be the
last<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.980> while<00:00:26.990> basically<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.349> we

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
last time for a while basically we we

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
last time for a while basically we we
own<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> townhouse<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.910> another<00:00:30.269> city<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.900> we

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
own a townhouse in another city and we

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
own a townhouse in another city and we
felt<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:32.040> were<00:00:32.160> growing<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.090> when<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
felt like we were growing it when we

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.620 
felt like we were growing it when we
only<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.899> child<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.000> rented<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.540> out

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
only had one child so we rented it out

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
only had one child so we rented it out
and<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.320> started<00:00:37.829> renting<00:00:38.100> homes<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.820> other

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and we started renting homes like other

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.139 
and we started renting homes like other
people's<00:00:39.270> houses<00:00:39.420> bigger<00:00:39.870> houses<00:00:40.079> just

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
people's houses bigger houses just

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.990 
people's houses bigger houses just
because<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.300> wanted<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.140> space<00:00:43.670> anyways<00:00:44.670> it's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
because we wanted the space anyways it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
because we wanted the space anyways it's
turned<00:00:45.629> into<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> nightmare<00:00:46.410> we've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
turned into a bit of a nightmare we've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
turned into a bit of a nightmare we've
had<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.280> water<00:00:47.579> mains<00:00:47.820> break<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> places

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
had like water mains break in places

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.270 
had like water mains break in places
we've<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.079> we've<00:00:49.230> had<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> move<00:00:49.620> places<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we've so we've had to move places for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
we've so we've had to move places for
reasons<00:00:50.610> we've<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:50.910> issues<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.300> tenants

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
reasons we've had issues with tenants

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
reasons we've had issues with tenants
because<00:00:52.140> having<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> tenant<00:00:53.340> isn't<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.329> most

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
because having a tenant isn't the most

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
because having a tenant isn't the most
fun<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.260> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> don't<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.980> good

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fun all the time if you don't have good

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.180 
fun all the time if you don't have good
tenants<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.420> anyways<00:00:57.960> our<00:00:58.289> current<00:00:58.680> tenants

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
tenants so anyways our current tenants

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
tenants so anyways our current tenants
are<00:00:59.340> having<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> move<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.059> before<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.079> lease

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
are having to move out before the lease

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
are having to move out before the lease
is<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.190> us<00:01:02.370> thinking<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is up but I just got us thinking you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
is up but I just got us thinking you
know<00:01:03.180> should<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.110> continue<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.650> whole

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
know should we continue this whole

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.820 
know should we continue this whole
renting<00:01:05.309> process<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.150> should<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.960> move<00:01:07.110> back

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
renting process or should just move back

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
renting process or should just move back
to<00:01:08.070> our<00:01:08.100> townhouse<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:09.060> originally

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to our townhouse that you're originally

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.440 
to our townhouse that you're originally
at<00:01:09.840> um<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.490> end<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> stress<00:01:12.330> of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
at um and just end all the stress of

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
at um and just end all the stress of
this<00:01:12.570> whole<00:01:12.780> renting<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.830> felt<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> was

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this whole renting so we felt it was

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
this whole renting so we felt it was
best<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.610> our<00:01:14.850> family<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.630> ahead<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.990> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
best for our family to go ahead and do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
best for our family to go ahead and do
that<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.000> we're<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.150> we're

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that so that's what we're doing we're

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
that so that's what we're doing we're
moving<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.780> next<00:01:18.960> month<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.650> we'll<00:01:20.220> probably

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
moving out next month and we'll probably

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
moving out next month and we'll probably
be<00:01:20.549> there<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> couple<00:01:21.060> years<00:01:21.240> we're<00:01:21.780> hoping

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
