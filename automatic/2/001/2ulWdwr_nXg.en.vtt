00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
250-gallon system we have gone in

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.400 
250-gallon system we have gone in
Tennessee<00:00:06.270> right<00:00:06.569> now<00:00:06.720> back<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.109> Nashville<00:00:08.300> so

in recently and I have about 22 in there

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380 
in recently and I have about 22 in there
right<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.310> I'd<00:00:17.820> say<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.150> a

right now that are I'd say about a
quarter<00:00:18.840> pound<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:20.070> tank<00:00:20.400> can<00:00:20.580> hold<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:21.750> to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
quarter pound this tank can hold up to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.230 
quarter pound this tank can hold up to
250<00:00:23.070> pounds<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.670> tilapia<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:25.910> when<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> water

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
250 pounds of tilapia so when the water

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.429 
250 pounds of tilapia so when the water
line<00:00:27.630> gets<00:00:27.930> high<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:30.240> goes<00:00:30.300> into<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.109> green

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
line gets high it goes into this green

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.910 
line gets high it goes into this green
right<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.910> by<00:00:33.149> gravity<00:00:33.600> goes<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
right here and by gravity goes down to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.270 
right here and by gravity goes down to
our<00:00:35.190> three<00:00:36.090> beds<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.719> there's<00:00:37.110> three<00:00:37.950> drains

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
our three beds and there's three drains

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.950 
our three beds and there's three drains
that<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> same<00:00:39.059> levels<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.809> go

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that are all the same levels so they go

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
that are all the same levels so they go
the<00:00:40.110> same<00:00:40.320> speed<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.309> there

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the same speed and the one down there

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
the same speed and the one down there
haven't<00:00:42.329> planted<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.719> last<00:00:42.989> bed<00:00:43.230> yet

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
haven't planted this last bed yet

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.779 
haven't planted this last bed yet
because<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.710> waiting<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.340> seeds<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because I'm waiting for some seeds to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.350 
because I'm waiting for some seeds to
come<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> these<00:00:45.510> these<00:00:46.379> trays<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.360> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
come up in these these trays but this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.220 
come up in these these trays but this
bed<00:00:48.570> we've<00:00:48.750> got<00:00:48.950> several<00:00:50.840> strawberry<00:00:51.840> plants

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
bed we've got several strawberry plants

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
bed we've got several strawberry plants
going<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:52.829> blooms<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.340> them<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
going with some blooms on them so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
going with some blooms on them so
they're<00:00:53.850> looking<00:00:54.090> pretty<00:00:54.180> good<00:00:54.449> some<00:00:54.750> small

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
they're looking pretty good some small

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.920 
they're looking pretty good some small
strawberries<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.530> so

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
strawberries here you can see that so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.149 
strawberries here you can see that so
anyways<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.570> water<00:01:03.780> comes<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:05.010> these

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
anyways so the water comes in to these

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.090 
anyways so the water comes in to these
three<00:01:05.430> beds<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:07.970> we<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> 2<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.920> 2<00:01:10.920> inch

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
three beds and we have a 2 a 2 inch

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.090 
three beds and we have a 2 a 2 inch
layer<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> bottom<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.930> always<00:01:13.710> has

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
layer at the bottom that always has

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
layer at the bottom that always has
water<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> rise<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.330> phils<00:01:15.840> own

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
water in it and then a rise in phils own

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
water in it and then a rise in phils own
that's<00:01:16.380> about<00:01:16.560> 8<00:01:16.740> inches<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.490> 2<00:01:17.700> inches

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that's about 8 inches and then 2 inches

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.109 
that's about 8 inches and then 2 inches
of<00:01:18.150> gravel<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.140> never<00:01:19.759> get<00:01:20.759> there

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
of gravel on top that never get there

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.730 
of gravel on top that never get there
always<00:01:21.299> draw<00:01:21.630> never<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> touched<00:01:22.259> by<00:01:22.470> water

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
always draw never you touched by water

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
always draw never you touched by water
so<00:01:23.040> there's<00:01:23.549> no<00:01:24.119> evaporation<00:01:24.360> there's<00:01:24.930> come<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
so there's no evaporation there's come a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490 
so there's no evaporation there's come a
barrier<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.960> when<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> water<00:01:28.229> gets

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
barrier there and so when the water gets

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.670 
barrier there and so when the water gets
up<00:01:29.299> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:30.720> inside<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.049> 22<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
up if you can see inside this 22 this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.870 
up if you can see inside this 22 this
one-inch<00:01:32.150> pipe<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> middle<00:01:34.549> we<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
one-inch pipe in the middle we want that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
one-inch pipe in the middle we want that
water<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.500> this

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
water to go down if we just had this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
water to go down if we just had this
pipe<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
pipe in there it would just come up to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
pipe in there it would just come up to
that<00:01:39.869> level<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> then<00:01:40.590> drain<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that level and then drain like it is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
that level and then drain like it is
right<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.229> something<00:01:43.470> called<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
right now but we use something called a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
right now but we use something called a
bell<00:01:44.100> siphon<00:01:44.420> which<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.960> guy

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
bell siphon which is this little guy

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
bell siphon which is this little guy
this<00:01:46.649> two-inch<00:01:47.009> pipe<00:01:47.250> slides<00:01:47.610> over<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> one

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
this two-inch pipe slides over that one

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.569 
this two-inch pipe slides over that one
inch<00:01:48.420> pipe<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.649> creates<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:51.200> siphon<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.579> if

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
inch pipe and it creates a siphon and if

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.830 
inch pipe and it creates a siphon and if
you<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> water<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> just

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you see right now the water is just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620 
you see right now the water is just
trickling<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.740> bottom<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.630> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trickling out that bottom there that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.170 
trickling out that bottom there that
white<00:01:57.810> pipe<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.860> when<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> put<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
white pipe so when I put this on it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.969 
white pipe so when I put this on it
should<00:02:00.390> start<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> siphon<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.740> bed

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
should start a siphon and the whole bed

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.450 
should start a siphon and the whole bed
should<00:02:02.280> drain<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.680> holes<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
should drain down to these holes that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.719 
should drain down to these holes that
are<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.329> PVC<00:02:06.780> pipe<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.320> we'll<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
are in the PVC pipe so we'll put that on

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.920 
are in the PVC pipe so we'll put that on
there<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:11.190> myth<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.730> outside<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.629> just

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
there and this myth this outside is just

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.610 
there and this myth this outside is just
for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
for

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
for
keeping<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> gravel<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:14.849> of<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.959> now

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
keeping the gravel out of that so now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.530 
keeping the gravel out of that so now
you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.069> picking<00:02:17.489> up<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
you can see it really picking up the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.070 
you can see it really picking up the
siphon<00:02:19.019> s<00:02:19.140> kicked<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.659> whole<00:02:21.840> bed

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
siphon s kicked in and so the whole bed

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.490 
siphon s kicked in and so the whole bed
is<00:02:22.349> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> drain<00:02:22.890> down<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.319> inch

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
is going to drain down to that two inch

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
is going to drain down to that two inch
line<00:02:25.709> where<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> holes<00:02:26.549> drilled<00:02:26.909> so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
line where we have the holes drilled so

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.890 
line where we have the holes drilled so
then<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.709> our<00:02:28.920> pump<00:02:29.459> now<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:30.659> just<00:02:30.840> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
then we have our pump now this is just a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.300 
then we have our pump now this is just a
little<00:02:31.019> fountain<00:02:31.260> feature<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.799> aerate<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.159> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
little fountain feature to aerate it a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.140 
little fountain feature to aerate it a
little<00:02:32.459> more<00:02:32.700> but<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:32.970> pump<00:02:33.810> pumps<00:02:34.530> back<00:02:34.739> up

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
little more but the pump pumps back up

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.360 
little more but the pump pumps back up
here<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:37.280> falls<00:02:38.280> back<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:40.040> that's<00:02:41.040> how<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
here and falls back in so that's how the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.770 
here and falls back in so that's how the
system<00:02:41.640> works<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.950> we<00:02:43.950> got<00:02:44.099> some<00:02:44.780> little

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
system works and we got some little

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.449 
system works and we got some little
tomatoes<00:02:46.730> coming<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.819> right<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.459> some

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
tomatoes coming in right here and some

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.740 
tomatoes coming in right here and some
onions<00:02:50.849> coming<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:53.599> strawberries<00:02:54.599> of

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
onions coming up and strawberries of

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.509 
onions coming up and strawberries of
course<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.500> hopefully<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:56.280> thing<00:02:56.489> will

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
course and hopefully this thing will

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.360 
course and hopefully this thing will
start<00:02:56.879> really<00:02:57.440> really<00:02:58.440> picking<00:02:58.829> up<00:02:58.920> we've<00:02:59.190> got

continuously and it's running about

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.089 
continuously and it's running about
kilowatt<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:32.210> day<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.110> that's<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.680> thousand

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
kilowatt a day so that's a thousand

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.990 
kilowatt a day so that's a thousand
watts<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.430> day<00:04:34.639> and<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:37.340> here<00:04:37.940> in

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
watts a day and that and here in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.249 
watts a day and that and here in
Nashville<00:04:38.419> is<00:04:38.479> going<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.720> cost<00:04:38.870> us<00:04:39.080> about

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
Nashville is going to cost us about

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.439 
Nashville is going to cost us about
twenty<00:04:39.800> seven<00:04:40.099> to<00:04:40.190> thirty<00:04:40.430> dollars<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.150> month

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
twenty seven to thirty dollars a month

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.850 
twenty seven to thirty dollars a month
per<00:04:42.259> system<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:44.199> that's<00:04:45.199> our<00:04:45.440> operating

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
per system so that's our operating

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.909 
per system so that's our operating
crossed<00:04:46.389> assuming<00:04:47.389> that<00:04:48.110> we<00:04:48.470> can<00:04:48.740> grow<00:04:48.889> a

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
crossed assuming that we can grow a

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.360 
crossed assuming that we can grow a
bunch<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.310> our<00:04:49.460> own<00:04:50.440> tilapia<00:04:51.440> food<00:04:51.889> which<00:04:52.130> I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
bunch of our own tilapia food which I

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.830 
bunch of our own tilapia food which I
think<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.060> can<00:04:53.180> do<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.419> with<00:04:53.570> something

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
think we can do that with something

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.360 
think we can do that with something
called<00:04:53.960> black<00:04:54.199> soldier<00:04:54.560> flies<00:04:54.830> which<00:04:55.190> I've

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
called black soldier flies which I've

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.210 
called black soldier flies which I've
talked<00:04:55.639> about<00:04:55.849> in<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.000> past<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:57.190> with<00:04:58.190> a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
talked about in the past and with a

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.010 
talked about in the past and with a
small<00:04:58.669> plant<00:04:58.940> called<00:04:59.120> duck<00:04:59.449> wheat<00:04:59.690> so

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
small plant called duck wheat so

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.070 
small plant called duck wheat so
hopefully<00:05:00.800> between<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.280> two<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.610> those<00:05:02.080> we

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
hopefully between the two of those we

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.810 
hopefully between the two of those we
can<00:05:03.760> keep<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:06.340> operational<00:05:07.340> costs<00:05:07.580> down

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
can keep that the operational costs down

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.029 
can keep that the operational costs down
to<00:05:08.030> just<00:05:08.180> electricity<00:05:08.630> which<00:05:09.050> is<00:05:09.199> only<00:05:09.349> 27<00:05:09.830> to

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
to just electricity which is only 27 to

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.450 
to just electricity which is only 27 to
30<00:05:10.250> bucks<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.669> month<00:05:10.820> per<00:05:11.419> system<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:12.590> we<00:05:12.800> have

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
30 bucks a month per system so we have

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.670 
30 bucks a month per system so we have
more<00:05:13.699> it<00:05:14.300> will<00:05:14.360> go<00:05:14.479> up<00:05:14.510> in<00:05:14.990> thirty<00:05:15.470> dollar

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
more it will go up in thirty dollar

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.379 
more it will go up in thirty dollar
increments<00:05:15.979> but<00:05:16.400> think<00:05:17.060> for<00:05:17.090> what<00:05:17.300> we're

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
increments but think for what we're

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.670 
increments but think for what we're
going<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.599> get<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:17.840> of<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.169> we're<00:05:18.470> going<00:05:18.560> to

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
going to get out of it we're going to

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.129 
going to get out of it we're going to
grow<00:05:19.039> a<00:05:19.070> lot<00:05:19.280> more<00:05:19.490> than<00:05:19.699> thirty<00:05:20.139> dollars

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
grow a lot more than thirty dollars

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.200 
grow a lot more than thirty dollars
worth<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.409> food<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:22.340> something<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.150> think

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
worth of food so something to think

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.389 
worth of food so something to think
about
