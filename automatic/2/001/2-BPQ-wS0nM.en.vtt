we're<00:00:01.899> now<00:00:02.020> looking<00:00:02.200> at<00:00:02.530> the<00:00:02.679> liver<00:00:03.100> of<00:00:03.310> the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:03.429 
we're now looking at the liver of the

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:05.340 
we're now looking at the liver of the
horse<00:00:03.639> and<00:00:03.820> as<00:00:03.939> you<00:00:04.030> can<00:00:04.180> see<00:00:04.359> this<00:00:04.870> is<00:00:05.080> a

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
horse and as you can see this is a

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.210 
horse and as you can see this is a
reddish-brown<00:00:06.959> fairly<00:00:07.959> smooth<00:00:08.740> bordered

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
reddish-brown fairly smooth bordered

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.430 
reddish-brown fairly smooth bordered
organ<00:00:09.670> we're<00:00:10.210> looking<00:00:10.420> at<00:00:10.510> the<00:00:10.600> diaphragmatic

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
organ we're looking at the diaphragmatic

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.080 
organ we're looking at the diaphragmatic
surface<00:00:11.650> and<00:00:12.070> it<00:00:12.160> should<00:00:12.310> be<00:00:12.430> nice<00:00:12.580> and<00:00:12.640> smooth

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
surface and it should be nice and smooth

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.529 
surface and it should be nice and smooth
as<00:00:13.690> it<00:00:13.750> is<00:00:14.080> here<00:00:14.500> we've<00:00:15.250> got<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:16.029> remnants<00:00:16.509> of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
as it is here we've got the remnants of

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.679 
as it is here we've got the remnants of
the<00:00:16.900> fibrous<00:00:17.289> part<00:00:17.619> of<00:00:17.859> the<00:00:18.130> diaphragm

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:18.689 
the fibrous part of the diaphragm

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.019 
the fibrous part of the diaphragm
attached<00:00:19.689> here<00:00:20.199> and<00:00:20.410> at<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.039> right<00:00:21.490> hand<00:00:21.759> of

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
attached here and at the right hand of

quite normal so do not mistake that for

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.480 
quite normal so do not mistake that for
some<00:00:31.060> abnormal<00:00:31.810> adhesion<00:00:32.320> that<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> normal

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
some abnormal adhesion that is a normal

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.350 
some abnormal adhesion that is a normal
attachment<00:00:34.300> on<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.410> surface<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:36.070> the<00:00:36.520> capsule

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
attachment on the surface of the capsule

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.290 
attachment on the surface of the capsule
here<00:00:37.600> there's<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.900> small<00:00:38.230> white<00:00:38.610> area<00:00:39.610> with<00:00:40.030> a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
here there's a small white area with a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.260 
here there's a small white area with a
little<00:00:40.630> tag<00:00:41.020> like<00:00:41.290> structure<00:00:41.920> which<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.940> a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
little tag like structure which is a

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.650 
little tag like structure which is a
fibrous<00:00:43.750> scar<00:00:44.170> like<00:00:44.820> formation<00:00:45.820> as<00:00:46.150> a<00:00:46.210> result

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
fibrous scar like formation as a result

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.920 
fibrous scar like formation as a result
of<00:00:47.100> movement<00:00:48.100> between<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.820> hepatic<00:00:49.390> capsule

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
of movement between the hepatic capsule

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.560 
of movement between the hepatic capsule
and<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.500> diaphragm<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.760> not<00:00:51.940> unusual<00:00:52.450> in

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
and the diaphragm this is not unusual in

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.450 
and the diaphragm this is not unusual in
horses<00:00:52.960> particularly<00:00:53.560> those<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:53.740> do<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> lot

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
horses particularly those that do a lot

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.610 
horses particularly those that do a lot
of<00:00:54.610> exercise<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:55.900> again<00:00:56.170> it's<00:00:56.470> an

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
of exercise and so again it's an

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.680 
of exercise and so again it's an
incidental<00:00:57.070> feature<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:57.880> not<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.540> be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
incidental feature and not to be

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.810 
incidental feature and not to be
interpreted<00:00:59.530> as<00:00:59.820> pathologically

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
interpreted as pathologically

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.200 
interpreted as pathologically
significant<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.860> now<00:01:03.010> if<00:01:03.280> we<00:01:03.490> turn<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.030> over

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
significant and now if we turn it over

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.880 
significant and now if we turn it over
and<00:01:04.390> look<00:01:04.570> at<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.749> visceral<00:01:05.109> surface<00:01:05.320> we<00:01:05.740> can

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
and look at the visceral surface we can

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.130 
and look at the visceral surface we can
see<00:01:06.100> similar<00:01:07.030> smooth<00:01:07.749> capsule<00:01:08.259> here<00:01:09.509> just<00:01:10.509> dry

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
see similar smooth capsule here just dry

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.410 
see similar smooth capsule here just dry
it<00:01:11.200> off<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.439> little<00:01:11.649> bit<00:01:11.890> just<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.280> take<00:01:12.549> some<00:01:13.299> of

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
it off a little bit just to take some of

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.719 
it off a little bit just to take some of
the<00:01:13.479> moisture<00:01:13.600> off<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.829> can<00:01:14.979> see<00:01:15.189> that<00:01:15.399> here

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
the moisture off you can see that here

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.679 
the moisture off you can see that here
is<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.799> remnants<00:01:17.799> of<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.479> entry<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.569> the

an attachment and there's another
interesting<00:01:31.149> feature<00:01:31.869> here<00:01:32.350> you'll<00:01:32.710> notice

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
interesting feature here you'll notice

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.309 
interesting feature here you'll notice
that<00:01:33.280> there<00:01:33.520> are<00:01:33.789> some<00:01:34.060> small<00:01:35.280> thefts<00:01:36.280> and

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
that there are some small thefts and

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.870 
that there are some small thefts and
subdivisions<00:01:38.319> of<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:38.859> part<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.520> liver

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
subdivisions of this part of the liver

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
subdivisions of this part of the liver
low<00:01:40.119> again<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.920> developmental

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
low again this is just a developmental

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.469 
low again this is just a developmental
variation<00:01:44.950> there's<00:01:45.280> nothing<00:01:45.759> pathologically

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
variation there's nothing pathologically

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.109 
variation there's nothing pathologically
significant<00:01:47.109> about<00:01:47.439> this<00:01:47.740> at<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.219> these<00:01:48.759> are

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
significant about this at all these are

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.910 
significant about this at all these are
congenital<00:01:50.020> variations<00:01:50.859> of<00:01:51.069> normality<00:01:52.859> as<00:01:53.859> a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
congenital variations of normality as a

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.669 
congenital variations of normality as a
final<00:01:54.459> examination<00:01:55.060> one<00:01:55.719> should<00:01:56.020> just<00:01:56.380> look

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
final examination one should just look

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.980 
final examination one should just look
at<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.859> parenchymal<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:57.759> do<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.299> series<00:01:58.959> of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
at the parenchymal so do a series of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.279 
at the parenchymal so do a series of
cuts<00:01:59.770> like<00:02:00.520> we<00:02:00.670> did<00:02:00.819> for<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.060> spleen<00:02:01.389> and<00:02:01.659> then

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
cuts like we did for the spleen and then

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.679 
cuts like we did for the spleen and then
just<00:02:02.679> examine<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.310> parenchyma<00:02:03.609> and<00:02:04.029> you<00:02:04.509> can

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
just examine the parenchyma and you can

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.769 
just examine the parenchyma and you can
see<00:02:04.899> here<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.709> is<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.950> fairly<00:02:06.779> blood

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:07.779 
see here that this is a fairly blood

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:10.050 
see here that this is a fairly blood
filled<00:02:08.080> liver<00:02:08.590> lots<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.459> blood<00:02:09.640> coming<00:02:09.909> out

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
filled liver lots of blood coming out

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.120 
filled liver lots of blood coming out
and<00:02:10.450> always<00:02:10.689> just<00:02:11.519> dry<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.580> parenchymal<00:02:12.970> off

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
