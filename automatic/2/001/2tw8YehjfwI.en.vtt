it cuts out a couple of the cylinders so

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
it cuts out a couple of the cylinders so
it's<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.110> six-cylinder<00:02:32.560> engine<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.239> will

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
it's a six-cylinder engine and it will

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.009 
it's a six-cylinder engine and it will
run<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.349> either<00:02:35.920> three<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> cylinders<00:02:37.060> for

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and obviously if it's going to cut down

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.750 
and obviously if it's going to cut down
half<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> cylinders<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.190> doesn't<00:02:45.640> need

half of the cylinders it doesn't need

half of the cylinders it doesn't need
the<00:02:45.910> power<00:02:46.290> thereby<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.560> saves<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.069> bunch<00:02:48.549> of

the power thereby it saves a bunch of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.910 
the power thereby it saves a bunch of
