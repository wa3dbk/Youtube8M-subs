knife in the 6-inch because you want
this<00:02:35.330> bridge<00:02:35.810> over<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:36.680> far<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.390> these

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
this bridge over as far as that these

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.550 
this bridge over as far as that these
things<00:02:38.930> inches<00:02:39.320> maybe<00:02:40.100> even<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.580> than<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
things inches maybe even more than that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.990 
things inches maybe even more than that
could<00:02:42.560> go<00:02:42.800> over<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.160> with<00:02:43.430> an<00:02:43.640> eight-inch

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
could go over this with an eight-inch

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.290 
could go over this with an eight-inch
knife<00:02:44.300> or<00:02:45.170> even<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.790> 10-inch<00:02:47.420> knife<00:02:47.660> down<00:02:48.050> here

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
knife or even a 10-inch knife down here

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.490 
knife or even a 10-inch knife down here
so<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:52.760> beat<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.390> as<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.080> take<00:02:54.350> it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
so not beat up this as I can take it

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.910 
so not beat up this as I can take it
aside<00:02:54.860> or<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.870> push<00:02:57.200> tight<00:02:57.620> on

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
aside or like it just push tight on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.750 
aside or like it just push tight on
there<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:59.240> whip<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.510> out
