00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.630
 color of where this came from 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.210
 nÃ© more specifically skins 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.470
 made by a brand called branding 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 This is the brand here. 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 this is the packaging that arrived 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 to dot dot com is a Canadian site 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
 is a Canadian company that does this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 skin type and they send it to the world 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.520
 all and for who will ask how it went 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.920
 that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 this business of buying out there 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 in an envelope so it arrived in an envelope 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 chart 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 sure only the address here and cac is came from 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.869
 canada standard letter envelope 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 lope with the low for example did not arrive 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.939
 good stickers how did it go 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.310
 this application are three parts to the right 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.570
 not only macbook 12 macbook case but 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.450
 of any book mark first this 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 top and already comes with the hole here 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.140
 to the apple I've ever seen a cutout 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.270
 the bottom part 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.040
 already comes with a cut of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.110
 macbook so let's worry about 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.110
 this and also the screw that will take 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.509
 the cap does not have it out, it's all there 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.799
 still below the lower part of 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 Big and a strip here to make a 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.750
 detail the macbook and finally the track 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.380
 pad that is the most peculiar part I 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.450
 I say right 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.350
 about the individual is one we were sure 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.210

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.160
 one more thing knows is offered from 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.270
