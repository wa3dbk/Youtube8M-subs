00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.090
 History 6 poor man after so long 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.890
 he finds the place he owns and suffers 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.800
 a golazo on the first pitch is redone 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.949
 making a good parade soon after 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.900
 bonucci 6 behind the work is missing so yes 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.789
 often pushes forward by sinning a little 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.229
 of imprecision but touching the goal of 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.479
 brown head 6 for him too is not 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.309
 easy to get out of mothballs well 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.729
 when it supports the maneuver less in the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.280
 rare occasions in which he must defend 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:45.489
 peluso 6 maintains the position without 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.979
 overdo lichtsteiner 7 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.019
 the vote is largely due to 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.609
 first time in which bowl in the middle one 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.649
 half a dozen balloons to the kiss that 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.559
 they were just slammed in the door 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.929
 in the second half it takes 10 minutes 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.629
 understandably he can't take it anymore 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.219
 vidal 7 does beauty and bad weather 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.870
 playmaker as trequartista e 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.980
 conquering the rigor that finally 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.960
 unlock the okba 7 director race 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.090
 set back high balls are all 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.160
 his and many he conquers by sorting them to 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.470
 but my foot this time is not 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 hot 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.300
 jugglers 6 possessed and what 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.990
 more often it goes close to the goal but ends 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.110
 always to make pieces look good 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.390
 asamoah 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 if and half after a broken start 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.050
 he takes courage and how he too 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.970
 lichtsteiner serves several balls 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.280
 inviting including the mirko for the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.450
 doubling worrying a couple of declines 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.400
 of vucinic concentration 7 one 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.710
 absurd performance within a 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.420
 absurd game first participates in the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.409
 festival of the goal eaten wrong 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.150
 the most tempting opportunity 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.370
 then he is forgiven with interest 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.480
 they will perfect the perfect penalty and score a 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.240
 goal of his 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.540
 the count vaffa says it all 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 giovinco 6 by force of taking them this time 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.140
 he was seriously hurt 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.320
 pity because he wasn't playing badly 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.409
 good luck if seba quagliarella if and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.299
 half inspired but pelizzoli today was in 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:14.319
 day of grace 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.719
 isla and matri without vote count if and a half 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.249
 probably in the initial projects 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.930
 it had to be a practice from 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.129
 close quickly so as not to waste 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.109
 too much energy 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.939
 in fact the juve despite the many 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.859
 absences constantly plays the attack 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.540
 producing such a mass of occasions 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.939
 from goals that would have been enough for half 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.920
 round but unlocking the race only on 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.120
 very clear rigor as the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.040
 consequent expulsion 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 one of those games that make you 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.120
 hate this sport
