be doing a video on how to tie the
trucker's<00:00:18.210> hitch<00:00:18.390> I've<00:00:19.380> also<00:00:19.620> seen<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> called

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
trucker's hitch I've also seen it called

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.890 
trucker's hitch I've also seen it called
a<00:00:20.250> truckie<00:00:20.580> hitch<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a truckie hitch there's a little bit of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
a truckie hitch there's a little bit of
variability<00:00:22.350> within<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.550> I've<00:00:23.640> seen

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
variability within this that I've seen

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
variability within this that I've seen
on<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.780> videos<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.620> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.740> doing

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
on some videos but I'm going to be doing

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.230 
on some videos but I'm going to be doing
it<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.190> that<00:00:26.370> I<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.700> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.940> way<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it the way that I like in the way that I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.359 
it the way that I like in the way that I
prefer<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.020> think<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> coolest<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.010> most

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
prefer and I think the coolest and most

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.569 
prefer and I think the coolest and most
effective<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.660> I'll<00:00:30.750> talk<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:30.990> where<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
effective and I'll talk about where that

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
effective and I'll talk about where that
variability<00:00:32.579> comes<00:00:32.759> into<00:00:33.149> play<00:00:33.360> once<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.870> get

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
variability comes into play once I get

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.950 
variability comes into play once I get
this<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.150> explained<00:00:36.150> how<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
this up and explained how to do it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.800 
this up and explained how to do it
so<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> start<00:00:37.980> need<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.280> piece<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> cordage<00:00:38.910> long

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
so to start need a piece of cordage long

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.479 
so to start need a piece of cordage long
enough<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.470> go<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
enough that's going to go it's going to

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.770 
enough that's going to go it's going to
work<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.850> between<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.450> fixed

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
work for this between your two fixed

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.650 
work for this between your two fixed
points<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.370> start<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.480> establish

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
points and to start you got to establish

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.580 
points and to start you got to establish
an<00:00:46.170> anchor<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.850> that's<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:49.230> trucker's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
an anchor and that's and the trucker's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.870 
an anchor and that's and the trucker's
hitch<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
hitch is really good if you want to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.590 
hitch is really good if you want to
secure<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> load<00:00:51.450> down<00:00:51.630> on<00:00:51.690> top<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.969> car<00:00:53.969> it's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
secure a load down on top of a car it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.910 
secure a load down on top of a car it's
where<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.840> came<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.380> believe<00:00:55.440> from

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
where it came from I believe from

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.500 
where it came from I believe from
truckers<00:00:56.340> doing<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.760> securing<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> load<00:00:57.390> down

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
truckers doing this securing a load down

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.350 
truckers doing this securing a load down
on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> trailer<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.370> imagine<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.120> you're

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
on the trailer you can imagine if you're

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.930 
on the trailer you can imagine if you're
putting<00:01:00.690> bags<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:01.350> anything<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.520> top<00:01:02.700> of<00:01:02.850> your

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.129 
gear basket on top of the Jeep anything
like<00:01:06.929> that<00:01:06.959> even<00:01:07.829> use<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.069> for<00:01:08.219> a<00:01:08.719> taut<00:01:09.719> line<00:01:09.929> or

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:10.139 
like that even use it for a taut line or

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:12.469 
like that even use it for a taut line or
a<00:01:10.170> ridge<00:01:10.350> line<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:11.969> methods<00:01:12.149> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
a ridge line but there's other methods I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.719 
a ridge line but there's other methods I
like<00:01:12.719> more<00:01:13.200> than<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> but

come over here to my second tie-down
point

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.490 

once<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:43.020> working<00:01:43.229> in

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
once I have that take my working in

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
once I have that take my working in
which<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.280> hand<00:01:44.610> throw<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
which is here my right hand throw it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.270 
which is here my right hand throw it
over<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> line<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.560> whole<00:01:46.740> way<00:01:46.770> completely

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.490 

so<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.399> something<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.850> looks<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.149> this

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
so have something that looks like this

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.980 
so have something that looks like this
this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.679> my<00:01:52.710> working<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> hanging<00:01:53.579> down

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
this is my working and hanging down

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.090 
this is my working and hanging down
cradle<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.560> middle<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
cradle a little bit in the middle of it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
cradle a little bit in the middle of it
remove<00:01:56.490> towards<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> anchor<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.420> if

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
remove towards the anchor because if

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
remove towards the anchor because if
your<00:01:57.750> imagine<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> gear<00:01:58.409> might<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.799> all<00:01:58.950> right

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
your imagine the gear might be all right

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
your imagine the gear might be all right
here<00:01:59.520> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.119> your<00:02:00.360> second<00:02:00.689> tied<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:00.990> point

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
here this is your second tied on point

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.569 
here this is your second tied on point
where<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.039> happen<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.460> going

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
where this is going to happen is going

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
where this is going to happen is going
to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.700> closer<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> middle<00:02:03.750> it's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to be closer not to the middle it's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.090 
to be closer not to the middle it's
going<00:02:04.289> to<00:02:04.350> end<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> other<00:02:04.560> side<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> gear

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
going to end the other side of the gear

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
going to end the other side of the gear
but<00:02:05.280> basically<00:02:05.929> once<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> right

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but basically once you have it right

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.780 
but basically once you have it right
here<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.479> want<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:10.160> take<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> hand<00:02:11.580> that's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
here you want to take the hand that's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.000 
here you want to take the hand that's
whatever<00:02:12.000> close<00:02:12.870> that's<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> side<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
whatever close that's on the side of the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.570 
whatever close that's on the side of the
anchor<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:16.590> working<00:02:16.890> end<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.459> my

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
anchor here is my working end here is my

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.300 
anchor here is my working end here is my
left<00:02:17.790> hand<00:02:17.930> working<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:19.769> anchors<00:02:20.130> on

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
left hand working here my anchors on

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.589 
left hand working here my anchors on
this<00:02:20.489> side<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.090> taking<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.450> my

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
this side of it so I'm taking in my

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.360 
this side of it so I'm taking in my
right<00:02:21.810> hand<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.319> case<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
right hand in this case I'm going to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.850 
right hand in this case I'm going to
form<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.910> loop<00:02:24.329> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.380> line<00:02:25.590> but

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
form a little loop in the line but

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.960 
form a little loop in the line but
basically<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.250> taking<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> line<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.849> just

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
basically it's taking the line and just

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.569 
basically it's taking the line and just
twisting<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.360> over<00:02:27.599> itself<00:02:27.900> once<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.459> I've

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
twisting it over itself once and I've

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.240 
twisting it over itself once and I've
created<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.000> loop<00:02:30.239> right<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:32.069> once

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
created this loop right here and once

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.170 
created this loop right here and once
I've<00:02:32.370> done<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.549> I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> take<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
I've done that I'm going to take the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.670 
I've done that I'm going to take the
other<00:02:33.209> part<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.690> line<00:02:33.900> still<00:02:34.290> leaving<00:02:34.470> my

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
other part of the line still leaving my

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
other part of the line still leaving my
working<00:02:35.010> end<00:02:35.130> hanging<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> middle<00:02:35.730> grab

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
working end hanging in the middle grab

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.110 
working end hanging in the middle grab
that<00:02:36.840> line<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> once<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.700> here<00:02:39.060> I'm

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that line and once I have that here I'm

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.940 
that line and once I have that here I'm
going<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.269> pull<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.569> line<00:02:39.750> through<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.319> at

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
going to pull the line through and at

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.589 
going to pull the line through and at
the<00:02:41.069> same<00:02:41.220> time<00:02:41.430> grab<00:02:41.730> my<00:02:41.910> working<00:02:42.299> end<00:02:42.450> on

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
the same time grab my working end on

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.710 
the same time grab my working end on
this<00:02:42.720> side<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.660> pull<00:02:45.870> tight<00:02:46.109> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
this side and then pull tight and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.030 
this side and then pull tight and
basically<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.170> done<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.500> give<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.829> this

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
basically what it's done is give me this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.090 
basically what it's done is give me this
is<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.310> pulley<00:02:51.060> right<00:02:51.359> here<00:02:51.569> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> will

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
is a pulley right here if you will

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.559 
is a pulley right here if you will
that's<00:02:53.100> helping<00:02:53.370> me<00:02:53.430> increase<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.790> mechanical

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
that's helping me increase my mechanical

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's helping me increase my mechanical
advantage<00:02:54.959> by<00:02:55.139> going<00:02:55.440> around<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.769> tree<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
advantage by going around the tree and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.440 
advantage by going around the tree and
then<00:02:56.130> having<00:02:56.280> another<00:02:56.579> point<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> talk<00:02:57.180> back

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
then having another point to talk back

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.740 
then having another point to talk back
and<00:02:58.220> because<00:02:59.220> I'm<00:02:59.790> using<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.239> paracord

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and because I'm using this paracord

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.330 
and because I'm using this paracord
herself<00:03:01.109> not<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> lot<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.650> friction<00:03:02.069> on<00:03:02.160> this

this<00:03:08.579> step<00:03:08.819> might<00:03:09.060> not<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.359> necessary<00:03:09.810> but

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
this step might not be necessary but

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.420 
this step might not be necessary but
because<00:03:10.230> I'm<00:03:10.350> using<00:03:10.530> paracord<00:03:11.100> there's<00:03:11.250> not<00:03:11.400> a

because I'm using paracord there's not a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.559 
because I'm using paracord there's not a
lot<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.609> friction<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.150> know<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.540> doesn't

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
lot of friction and I know it doesn't

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.270 
lot of friction and I know it doesn't
one<00:03:13.109> doesn't<00:03:13.380> want<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.560> hold<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.889> as<00:03:14.040> well

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
one doesn't want to hold this as well

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.550 
one doesn't want to hold this as well
I'm<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.609> put<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.819> half<00:03:15.090> hitch<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:16.440> this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
I'm going to put a half hitch with this

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.900 
I'm going to put a half hitch with this
loop<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.799> I've<00:03:17.010> created<00:03:17.250> basically<00:03:17.790> right

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
loop that I've created basically right

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.729 
loop that I've created basically right
now<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.329> hanging<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.750> sort<00:03:19.680> of

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
now is just hanging out just sort of

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.870 
now is just hanging out just sort of
waist<00:03:19.920> at<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.220> point<00:03:20.459> I'm<00:03:20.519> going<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.700> put<00:03:20.850> a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
waist at this point I'm going to put a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.080 
waist at this point I'm going to put a
half<00:03:21.060> hitch<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> know<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:23.370> isn't<00:03:23.790> going<00:03:23.940> to

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
half hitch so I know this isn't going to

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.039 
half hitch so I know this isn't going to
come<00:03:25.079> undone<00:03:26.269> whenever<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.359> talk<00:03:27.569> really<00:03:27.660> hard

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
come undone whenever I talk really hard

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.319

on<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.980> offers<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:30.000> lot<00:03:30.150> more

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
on it and that offers a lot more

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.650 
on it and that offers a lot more
security<00:03:30.889> at<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.099> point<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.609> can<00:03:33.000> just<00:03:33.269> really

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
security at this point I can just really

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.960 
security at this point I can just really
torque<00:03:34.019> down<00:03:34.200> on<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.470> line<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.880> not

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
torque down on the line and it's not

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.550 
torque down on the line and it's not
coming<00:03:36.269> apart<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.660> I'm<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.260> getting<00:03:37.500> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
coming apart and I'm really getting this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.430 
coming apart and I'm really getting this
tight<00:03:37.829> really<00:03:38.730> getting<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.030> tight<00:03:39.440> there's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
tight really getting this tight there's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.849 
tight really getting this tight there's
a<00:03:40.530> few<00:03:40.709> ways<00:03:40.859> then<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.099> can<00:03:41.400> finish<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.209> off

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
a few ways then you can finish this off

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.129 
a few ways then you can finish this off
you<00:03:43.859> can<00:03:44.130> do<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> half<00:03:44.669> hitch<00:03:44.880> over<00:03:45.180> here<00:03:45.690> here's

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
you can do a half hitch over here here's

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.490 
you can do a half hitch over here here's
my<00:03:46.200> working<00:03:46.470> end<00:03:46.760> I'm<00:03:48.019> going<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.110> hold<00:03:49.319> back

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
my working end I'm going to hold back

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.960 
my working end I'm going to hold back
this<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:49.890> under<00:03:50.099> pressure<00:03:50.340> I'm<00:03:50.579> going<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> hold

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
this is under pressure I'm going to hold

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.990 
this is under pressure I'm going to hold
that<00:03:51.150> here<00:03:51.890> take<00:03:52.890> my<00:03:53.040> working<00:03:53.250> end

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that here take my working end

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.510 
that here take my working end
slide<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.840> under

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.310 

that's<00:04:03.180> holding<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.480> really<00:04:03.780> pulling<00:04:04.230> that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
that's holding that really pulling that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.480 
that's holding that really pulling that
really<00:04:04.560> well<00:04:05.180> now<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.240> undo<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:08.310> take

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
really well now to undo this just take

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.710 
really well now to undo this just take
it<00:04:08.610> here<00:04:09.080> releases<00:04:10.080> that<00:04:11.390> pull<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.480> through

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
it here releases that pull it through

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.790 
it here releases that pull it through
the<00:04:12.870> loop<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:15.420> undo<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.260> half-inch<00:04:16.650> I've

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
the loop and undo this half-inch I've

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.890 
the loop and undo this half-inch I've
done<00:04:17.010> here<00:04:17.310> which<00:04:17.580> isn't<00:04:17.940> necessary<00:04:18.600> like<00:04:18.780> I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
done here which isn't necessary like I

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.780 
done here which isn't necessary like I
mentioned<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.500> beauty<00:04:20.160> about<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.610> is

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
mentioned and the beauty about this is

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.150 
mentioned and the beauty about this is
that<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> just<00:04:21.209> comes<00:04:21.390> apart<00:04:21.980> this<00:04:22.980> comes

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
that it just comes apart this comes

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.590 
that it just comes apart this comes
apart<00:04:23.280> that's<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.730> bit<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.000> variability<00:04:24.420> that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
apart that's a bit the variability that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.150 
apart that's a bit the variability that
I<00:04:24.690> mentioned<00:04:25.080> before<00:04:25.140> is<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.710> people<00:04:26.010> would

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
I mentioned before is that people would

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.430 
I mentioned before is that people would
tie<00:04:26.310> an<00:04:26.910> overhand<00:04:27.000> knot<00:04:27.420> in<00:04:27.750> here<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
tie an overhand knot in here or a

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.650 
tie an overhand knot in here or a
slipknot<00:04:28.860> in<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.250> line<00:04:29.460> at<00:04:29.850> where<00:04:30.120> acting<00:04:30.510> as

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
slipknot in the line at where acting as

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.230 
slipknot in the line at where acting as
the<00:04:30.780> pulley<00:04:31.020> but<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.740> reason<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.340> chose<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
the pulley but the reason I chose to

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.490 
the pulley but the reason I chose to
show<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.510> method<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:33.900> because<00:04:34.050> that's<00:04:34.380> not

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
show this method is because that's not

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.440 
show this method is because that's not
necessary<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.430> comes<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.820> because<00:04:36.300> it

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
necessary and it comes to because it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.420 
necessary and it comes to because it
comes<00:04:36.660> undone<00:04:36.990> if<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.890> is<00:04:38.070> going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.370> be

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
comes undone if this is going to be

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.100 
comes undone if this is going to be
exposed<00:04:38.670> to<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> elements<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.570> water<00:04:39.840> will

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
exposed to the elements and water will

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.510 
exposed to the elements and water will
get<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.470> maybe<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.770> lines<00:04:40.950> going<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.190> swell

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
get and maybe the lines going to swell

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.640 
get and maybe the lines going to swell
can<00:04:41.760> be<00:04:41.820> really<00:04:42.030> difficult<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.540> undo<00:04:42.990> knots<00:04:43.470> or

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
can be really difficult to undo knots or

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.280 
can be really difficult to undo knots or
hitches<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.450> method<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.930> shouldn't

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
hitches but this method you shouldn't

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.140 
hitches but this method you shouldn't
have<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.590> problem<00:04:46.830> I'm<00:04:47.730> gonna<00:04:47.850> do<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.030> one

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
have that problem I'm gonna do it one

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.310 
have that problem I'm gonna do it one
more<00:04:48.180> time<00:04:50.000> go<00:04:51.000> around<00:04:51.120> my<00:04:51.390> second<00:04:51.810> Anchor

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
more time go around my second Anchor

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.310 
more time go around my second Anchor
Point<00:04:52.970> take<00:04:53.970> my<00:04:54.150> working<00:04:54.360> end<00:04:54.630> throw<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.110> over

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
Point take my working end throw it over

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.160 
Point take my working end throw it over

the line let it hang do its thing for
now<00:04:58.260> give<00:04:58.470> myself<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.800> little<00:04:58.830> bit<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.250> little

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
now give myself a little bit a little

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.630 
now give myself a little bit a little
bit<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.030> slack<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.420> work<00:05:00.570> with<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:02.400> hand

you the line form a little loop in here

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.890 
you the line form a little loop in here
just<00:05:13.740> by<00:05:13.980> twisting<00:05:14.460> at<00:05:14.580> once<00:05:14.790> on<00:05:15.210> itself<00:05:15.510> you

cordage you have like I said you can
