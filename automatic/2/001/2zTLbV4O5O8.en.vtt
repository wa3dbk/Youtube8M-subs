00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.870
 I kissed the kiss 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.770
 more than seventh song passes clusters start in that case we 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.830

 the draw against Argentina in a month 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.429
 and the most successful repeated that is this site 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.970
 and again 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.960
 already what is in the preco gold 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.680

 and this is 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.850
 ivÃ¡n el corno do you touch of a simple narration little you 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.089
 but now what we are going to see is how to touch what is he alone locke is what 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.719
 more important the song 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.379
 that must and in this way 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.559
 urdaneta 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.559

 everyone 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.729
 min 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 shoemaker has 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:55.059
 we recognize process by conservation part little by little 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.889
 it is simply an envelope 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.869
 a printing company 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.869
 a wood 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
 in an article 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.720
 if you have any questions about how this is altogether felt in the choirs 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.769
 and I do not touch the first two do not agree 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.269
 and until there to the fifth we are going to do 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:32.209
 thereafter the common diesel that is the note 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.930
 taking the time until it took me some time to do this and even sometimes not 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.179
 it comes out so well but it is in tune 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.869
 and we can do them I do not know 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.449
 percent 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.449
 boston 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.369
 then you pass 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.299
 although it suits 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.299
 what we are here is 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.129
 bento 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.599
 everything happened that this block 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.789
 a thousand modest teams 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 percent to 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.220
 after succeeding 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.749
 another man that similar to the first 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:37.749
 but in this case pons understands that these two strings 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.930
 2 if you like the attempts 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.150
 2-3 and then 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
 we are very sorry 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.909
 we have agreed 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.909
 already looks beautiful past request 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.949
 this new year 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.949
 and we are going to make another slight 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.270
 and that something like that 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.969
 for example 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.629
 chance to give this 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.889
 and from here 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.889
 we go to what is 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.120
 bruno 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.210
 but all these are 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.210
 summit a soft stephenson eavesdropping 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.089
 hideki let's go so they are mossos in the octaves 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.919

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.059
 the Supreme 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.379
 third rope 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.129

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.039
 to pay 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.129
 then 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.509
 from there to get the stick 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.509
 after 17 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.559
 and of them the 14th sect obviously you 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:13.189
 d the same way 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.960

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 we are going to 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.870
 editor play alone very slowly so that we understand more 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:53.849
 and because in a park 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.020
 for try to make everything clear not 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.639
 pineapple 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.639
 no percent 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.020

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.500
 I hope with this and that is not all the envelopes one of the song 

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.090
