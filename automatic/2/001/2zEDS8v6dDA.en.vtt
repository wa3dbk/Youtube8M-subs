00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
hey guys I'm at from model flat and

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.070 
hey guys I'm at from model flat and
today<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.240> gonna<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> little<00:00:15.660> tutorial

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
today we're gonna do a little tutorial

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
today we're gonna do a little tutorial
on<00:00:16.470> how<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.160> RX<00:00:17.550> 2<00:00:17.850> sim<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
on how to use the RX 2 sim with the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.439 
on how to use the RX 2 sim with the
Phoenix<00:00:18.900> flight<00:00:18.990> simulator<00:00:20.060> okay<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.420> we

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Phoenix flight simulator okay so here we

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.230 
Phoenix flight simulator okay so here we
have<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.750> RX<00:00:22.080> 2<00:00:22.260> sim<00:00:22.470> module<00:00:23.150> included<00:00:24.150> with

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
have the RX 2 sim module included with

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.519 
have the RX 2 sim module included with
the<00:00:24.330> package<00:00:24.480> you'll<00:00:24.900> also<00:00:25.019> receive<00:00:25.320> some

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the package you'll also receive some

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.120 
the package you'll also receive some
adapter<00:00:26.099> leads<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.760> we've<00:00:26.910> got<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> 7<00:00:27.779> pin<00:00:28.130> sort

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
adapter leads so we've got a 7 pin sort

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.380 
adapter leads so we've got a 7 pin sort
of<00:00:29.189> parallel<00:00:29.519> connector<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:29.970> uses<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
of parallel connector which uses the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
of parallel connector which uses the
signal<00:00:30.750> wires<00:00:30.929> off<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> receiver<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.000> also

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
signal wires off the receiver and also

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
signal wires off the receiver and also
just<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> normal<00:00:33.870> mouse<00:00:34.050> mouse<00:00:34.320> servo

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
just a normal mouse mouse servo

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
just a normal mouse mouse servo
extension<00:00:35.190> lead<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.390> does<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
extension lead and what this does is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
extension lead and what this does is
allows<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> signal<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
allows you to get the signal from the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.229 
allows you to get the signal from the
receiver<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> module<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> firstly<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.120> get

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
receiver to the module so firstly to get

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.979 
receiver to the module so firstly to get
this<00:00:42.360> working

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this working

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
this working
we'll<00:00:43.379> need<00:00:43.530> obviously<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:44.219> receiver<00:00:44.610> for

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we'll need obviously your receiver for

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.459 
we'll need obviously your receiver for
the<00:00:45.210> purposes<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> video<00:00:45.809> we've<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.260> an<00:00:46.350> 8

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the purposes of the video we've got an 8

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.690 
the purposes of the video we've got an 8
channel<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
channel here so we can get all the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
channel here so we can get all the
functions<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.079> using<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.469> 6

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
functions but if you're using a 6

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
functions but if you're using a 6
channel<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.309> drop<00:00:50.489> let's<00:00:51.000> say

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
channel you would just drop let's say

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
channel you would just drop let's say
the<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.390> end<00:00:51.539> connectors<00:00:51.960> off<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.309> we've

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the two end connectors off so how we've

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.520 
the two end connectors off so how we've
got<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> we've<00:00:54.030> got<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> lead<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
got it we've got the lead with the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.750 
got it we've got the lead with the
negative<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.920> positive<00:00:55.980> wire<00:00:56.370> into<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
negative and positive wire into the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
negative and positive wire into the
throttle<00:00:56.940> channel<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.600> channel<00:00:57.840> number<00:00:58.170> one

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
throttle channel so channel number one

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
throttle channel so channel number one
and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.609> following<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.660> sequence

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and then following that in sequence

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.450 
and then following that in sequence
we've<00:01:01.500> got<00:01:01.680> obviously<00:01:01.770> aileron<00:01:02.370> elevator

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we've got obviously aileron elevator

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.189 
we've got obviously aileron elevator
rudder<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.480> moving<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.870> through<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
rudder and then moving on through the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
rudder and then moving on through the
axillary<00:01:04.500> channels<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> they're<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> as

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
axillary channels and they're all in as

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.109 
axillary channels and they're all in as
they<00:01:06.869> fall<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> plug<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.939> this<00:01:08.939> particular

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
they fall on the plug so this particular

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.960 
they fall on the plug so this particular
throttle<00:01:09.689> channel<00:01:09.720> will<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.979> RX<00:01:11.790> 2

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
throttle channel will go into the RX 2

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.450 
throttle channel will go into the RX 2
sim<00:01:12.150> module<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.799> port<00:01:13.799> number<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.220> whereas

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
sim module in port number one whereas

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.740 
sim module in port number one whereas
there's<00:01:14.670> negative<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.090> positive<00:01:15.420> obviously

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
there's negative and positive obviously

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.219 
there's negative and positive obviously
observing<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> correct<00:01:16.710> polarity<00:01:18.229> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
observing the correct polarity that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.870 
observing the correct polarity that
plugs<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.759> again

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
plugs into there and then again

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
plugs into there and then again
obviously<00:01:21.299> aileron<00:01:21.869> being<00:01:22.110> channel<00:01:22.470> number<00:01:22.710> 2

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
obviously aileron being channel number 2

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
obviously aileron being channel number 2
so<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.490> follow<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> wire

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so we follow that wire

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.370 
so we follow that wire
we'll<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> flip<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:24.990> connector<00:01:25.350> over

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
we'll have to flip this connector over

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
we'll have to flip this connector over
and<00:01:25.799> then<00:01:26.400> two<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:26.880> four<00:01:27.150> five<00:01:27.330> six<00:01:27.509> seven

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and then two three four five six seven

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
and then two three four five six seven
eight<00:01:27.960> next<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.030> connects<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
eight next to that and that connects the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.679 
eight next to that and that connects the
receiver<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:30.990> sim<00:01:31.290> module<00:01:32.689> secondly

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
receiver to the sim module secondly

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
receiver to the sim module secondly
we'll<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> using<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.619> adapter<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> dongle

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
we'll be using the adapter so the dongle

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
we'll be using the adapter so the dongle
that's<00:01:36.329> included<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.079> Phoenix<00:01:37.320> flight

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that's included with your Phoenix flight

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's included with your Phoenix flight
sim<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> allow<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
sim and this is to allow the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
we're just using a laptop so we'll check

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
we're just using a laptop so we'll check
that<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> lights

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that in there and you see the lights

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
that in there and you see the lights
light<00:02:08.099> up<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.550> you'll<00:02:08.789> also<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.060> your

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
light up and you'll also see your

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
light up and you'll also see your
receiver<00:02:09.660> come<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.080> online<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:11.520> feeds<00:02:11.790> the
