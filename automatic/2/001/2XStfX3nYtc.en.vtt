00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's also really hard to take off as far

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.390 
it's also really hard to take off as far
as<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.800> eyeshadow<00:02:01.220> goes<00:02:01.660> I<00:02:02.660> do<00:02:02.900> like<00:02:03.530> them<00:02:03.890> but

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
as the eyeshadow goes I do like them but

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.680 
as the eyeshadow goes I do like them but
it's<00:02:05.290> well<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:07.400> thing<00:02:07.610> with<00:02:07.790> me<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.450> I

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's well the thing with me is that I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.120 
it's well the thing with me is that I
thought<00:02:08.989> at<00:02:09.170> first<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.590> wasn't<00:02:09.890> really<00:02:10.100> like

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
thought at first it wasn't really like

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.400 
thought at first it wasn't really like
an<00:02:10.399> everyday<00:02:10.850> type<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:12.610> eyeshadow<00:02:13.610> however

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
an everyday type of eyeshadow however

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.530 
an everyday type of eyeshadow however
since<00:02:15.410> these<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.190> glittery<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.239> kind

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
since these are so glittery if you kind

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.940 
since these are so glittery if you kind
of<00:02:17.600> dab<00:02:17.870> your<00:02:18.050> brush<00:02:18.110> off<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.650> bit<00:02:18.830> it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
of dab your brush off a little bit it

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.350 
of dab your brush off a little bit it
takes<00:02:18.980> off<00:02:19.310> some<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> glitter<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.209> it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
takes off some of the glitter so it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.600 
takes off some of the glitter so it's
easier<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> work<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.350> also<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.489> you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
easier to work with and also when you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.630 
easier to work with and also when you
blend<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.450> doesn't<00:02:24.440> look<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.860> glittery<00:02:25.430> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
blend it doesn't look so glittery and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.250 
blend it doesn't look so glittery and
shimmery<00:02:26.060> anymore<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.540> kind<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> turns<00:02:27.050> into

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
shimmery anymore it kind of turns into

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.640 
shimmery anymore it kind of turns into
more<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.920> matte<00:02:28.280> color<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.989> because<00:02:30.470> of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
more like a matte color so because of

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.620 
more like a matte color so because of
that<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.860> actually<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.850> really<00:02:32.150> like<00:02:32.390> these

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that I actually do really like these

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.380 
that I actually do really like these
eyeshadows<00:02:33.549> because<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.730> first<00:02:34.940> time<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.120> used

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
eyeshadows because the first time I used

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.550 
eyeshadows because the first time I used
it<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.600> didn't<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.170> because<00:02:36.260> there<00:02:36.440> was<00:02:36.470> a

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
it I didn't like it because there was a

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.800 
it I didn't like it because there was a
lot<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.680> fallout<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.940> have<00:02:38.299> to<00:02:38.420> kind<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.630> work

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
lot of fallout so I have to kind of work

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.270 
lot of fallout so I have to kind of work
with<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.769> third<00:02:39.980> time<00:02:40.010> I've

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280

used and I have it on my eyes right now
and<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.590> don't<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:42.799> I<00:02:42.860> happen<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.459> now

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
and I don't know I happen to like it now

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.930 
and I don't know I happen to like it now
there's<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.350> lot<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.620> fallout<00:02:45.980> but<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:46.790> know

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
there's a lot of fallout but you know

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.880 
there's a lot of fallout but you know
like<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.209> said<00:02:47.420> if<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.720> dab<00:02:48.110> your<00:02:48.290> brush<00:02:48.350> get

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
like I said if you dab your brush get

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.620 
like I said if you dab your brush get
some<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> glitter<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.330> works

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
some of the glitter off it really works

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.460 
some of the glitter off it really works
and<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.410> also<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:52.820> kind<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.019> did<00:02:54.290> my

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
and then also I kind of when I did my

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.930 
and then also I kind of when I did my
eye<00:02:54.500> shadow<00:02:54.860> kind<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.190> had<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.489> my<00:02:55.580> finger

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
eye shadow kind of had to put my finger

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.400 
eye shadow kind of had to put my finger
under<00:02:56.150> my<00:02:56.269> eye<00:02:56.299> as<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:56.870> applying<00:02:57.080> my<00:02:57.230> eye

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
under my eye as I'm applying my eye

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.860 
under my eye as I'm applying my eye
shadow<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.489> helps<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.180> transfer

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
shadow and that helps to not transfer

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.110 
shadow and that helps to not transfer
the<00:02:59.989> glitter<00:03:00.260> underneath<00:03:01.250> your<00:03:01.430> eye<00:03:01.580> I

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:29.339 
was one of my favorite mascaras because

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:30.980 
was one of my favorite mascaras because
the<00:07:29.490> first<00:07:29.699> few<00:07:29.849> times<00:07:29.999> I<00:07:30.240> used<00:07:30.479> it<00:07:30.599> didn't

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
the first few times I used it didn't

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.449 
the first few times I used it didn't
really<00:07:31.080> clap<00:07:31.409> I<00:07:31.589> even<00:07:31.860> applied<00:07:32.039> it<00:07:32.219> like<00:07:32.339> three

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:32.459 
really clap I even applied it like three

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:34.189 
really clap I even applied it like three
times<00:07:32.669> so<00:07:32.759> I<00:07:32.819> don't<00:07:32.999> know<00:07:33.120> what<00:07:33.330> gave<00:07:33.599> now<00:07:33.839> a

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 
times so I don't know what gave now a

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.610 
times so I don't know what gave now a
clump<00:07:34.800> but<00:07:35.339> on<00:07:35.550> the<00:07:35.699> right<00:07:35.939> side<00:07:36.270> of<00:07:36.589> my<00:07:37.589> I

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
clump but on the right side of my I

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.920 
clump but on the right side of my I
didn't<00:07:38.370> clump<00:07:38.610> so<00:07:39.180> I<00:07:39.209> don't<00:07:39.419> know<00:07:39.479> it's<00:07:39.659> kind

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:39.930 
didn't clump so I don't know it's kind

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.239 
didn't clump so I don't know it's kind
of<00:07:40.050> it's<00:07:40.349> a<00:07:40.499> hit<00:07:40.649> or<00:07:40.680> miss<00:07:40.800> you're<00:07:41.159> gonna

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:41.249 
of it's a hit or miss you're gonna

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:42.439 
of it's a hit or miss you're gonna
either<00:07:41.399> love<00:07:41.519> it<00:07:41.699> or<00:07:41.879> you're<00:07:42.029> gonna<00:07:42.149> hate<00:07:42.389> it

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:42.449 
either love it or you're gonna hate it

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.629 
either love it or you're gonna hate it
but<00:07:43.110> when<00:07:43.229> it<00:07:43.349> works<00:07:43.499> for<00:07:43.800> you<00:07:43.979> it<00:07:44.219> happens<00:07:44.519> to

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 
but when it works for you it happens to

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.549 
but when it works for you it happens to
my<00:07:44.939> favorite<00:07:45.269> mascara<00:07:45.689> when<00:07:45.899> it<00:07:46.019> doesn't<00:07:46.229> I'm

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:46.559 
my favorite mascara when it doesn't I'm

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:47.839 
my favorite mascara when it doesn't I'm
just<00:07:46.740> just<00:07:46.889> like<00:07:47.069> clumping<00:07:47.459> and<00:07:47.580> that<00:07:47.729> was

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:47.849 
just just like clumping and that was

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:49.820 
just just like clumping and that was
kind<00:07:48.029> of<00:07:48.059> irritating<00:07:48.539> as<00:07:48.659> a<00:07:48.719> very<00:07:49.469> smooth

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:49.830 
kind of irritating as a very smooth

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.219 
kind of irritating as a very smooth
consistency<00:07:50.399> almost<00:07:50.819> like<00:07:50.969> liquid<00:07:51.180> liner<00:07:51.539> so

00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:52.229 
consistency almost like liquid liner so

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:53.659 
consistency almost like liquid liner so
that's<00:07:52.409> probably<00:07:52.649> why<00:07:52.889> you<00:07:52.949> have<00:07:53.159> to<00:07:53.279> be<00:07:53.370> very

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669 
that's probably why you have to be very

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:54.980 
that's probably why you have to be very
careful<00:07:54.120> when<00:07:54.240> you<00:07:54.300> work<00:07:54.449> with<00:07:54.479> it<00:07:54.659> I<00:07:54.809> don't

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:54.990 
careful when you work with it I don't

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.909 
careful when you work with it I don't
