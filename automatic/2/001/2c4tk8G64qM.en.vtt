00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 in this rehabilitation of being able to get 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.779
 to the world and consequently of being 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.210
 with my partners that I had a desire 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.630
 that above all speak Spanish too 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.599
 that you already have English in mind 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.510
 No, but you always strive 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.180
 you try so you can take the best 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 situation in the minimum possible time 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.820
 within a rehabilitation the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.859
 injuries we always have to count on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 she this is my second year that I'm in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 slovenia and the truth that very well 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 effecting now for the subject of those who 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.050
 we have had a little bit of trouble 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.680
 I have been the truth for a year and a half 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 that enchanted and a Ljubljana capital 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.760
 they have all the young is already super 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 European raised the truth that I am very 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.950
 happy with my decision and good screen 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.539
 as a club it is very professional then not 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.640
 I can complain my truth 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.030
 rehabilitation has changed a lot in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 how much I started playing has been very 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.260
 fast has changed very very fast 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.059
 then of course I noticed that I could 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.780
 that he could and clearly against more 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.150
 you cheer up, you cheer up 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.250
 and the truth that we are satisfied 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.540
 very much because I'm here but yes that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.159
 it's true that I want to have a respect 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 to the club and at all times when I've 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.540
 done things have been based on my 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 right always then we have had a 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.000
 little of disputes and good at the end its 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.830
 word against mine or ours if 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.170
 we have the federation that is 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.189
 helping a lot on the other hand 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.630
 is what I think I should not 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.250
 have any kind of consequence because 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.100
 I am within all my rights for 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.390
 complete but I do not know where I'm going to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.970
 leave them then right now 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.430
 I need to concentrate on what I am 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.899
 here to have the chip to play the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 human and to rehabilitate the shoulder 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.350
 in the best possible conditions for 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.899
 the world cup and that is my goal now 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 same no I do not want to think about other things 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.720
 the second phase and so it can be quite 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.729
 complicated and hard especially because the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.460
 level of fatigue can also 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.720
 accumulate and be great but it's true 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.610
 we have known each other for a long time 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.470
 time between many of us then 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.970
 there are things that are not lost I'm not going to 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.470
 to say that I want to, or are we going to 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.390
 get a medal because I do not know 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.399
 but yes it is true that I would sign 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 for having a medal right now to see 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.709
 I hope that a little bit of fear 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.390
 have we do not deserve it even if it's a 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.069
 little but 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.810
 and I think we're going to do 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.180
 our paper bit by bit working 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 Step by Step 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.280
 and try to crush the one who gets 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280
 in front of
