00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:10.590
 attentively 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 curious cuddly playful and with 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 quite a lot of speed Icelandic horses today 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.720
 we are to visit on the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 islandpferdehof enters milan im 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
 to learn more about the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 feeding the little Scandinavian 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.580
 experience 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.890
 In the wild, horses eat their horses 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.869
 This creates a lot of things throughout the day 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 saliva running to stomach and the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.600
 local acid balance 24 to 40 liters 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 spit are produced as per the day 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.020
 picture to the house horse also in the stall should 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 Make the horse as much memory as possible 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.460
 that's why phase rich woman is lining 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 the basis of feeding that is 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 without end how many offenders need of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.649
 It is easy to calculate 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.199
 one to one and a half kilo per 100 kilo 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.380
 Body weight for an Icelandic horse with 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.200
 500 kilos on the ribs that means yes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:18.240
 right 5 to 75 kilos a day as much 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.210
 As you can see here that is a field 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 from the browser room and barren climate 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.770
 comes where there are not enough available 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.869
 the horses also designed 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 this goes big over the centuries 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.439
 has become a little too little with little 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 do 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.030
 Nevertheless, Icelandic horses need something else 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.119
 feed as the rest of the horse world the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.979
 Volcanic soils in Iceland are very 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.799
 mineral-containing that is missing from us 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.740
 but about feed from rural ones 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.600
 specially tailored for Icelandic horses 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 for example, the league pellets of paris still 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.590
 little energy and protein for it all the more 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 Found and minerals must be horses 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.100
 In addition, they can do a lot 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.750
 in sport you need a little more energy 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.390
 in the yard then falls to me 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.390
 the best over the mÃ¼li pavon 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:32.890
 yes that's wonderful because of the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:37.970
 structure in there luzerner sugar protein 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 poor and the ama has tapped this is the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.910
 break extra gets for the mineral photo 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.540
 we totally give an insight 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.050
 there are human and horse to them 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 like meal time is already hurried 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.000
 Well then good appetite
