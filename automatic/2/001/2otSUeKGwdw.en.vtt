00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
inch been right here two different

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460 
inch been right here two different
shades<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.610> metal<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.170> high

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
shades of metal it's actually a high

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.840 
shades of metal it's actually a high
speed<00:01:25.740> steel<00:01:25.920> which<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.280> harder<00:01:26.640> than<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
speed steel which is harder than a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
speed steel which is harder than a
common<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.690> look<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.870> upwards<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.440> 500

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
common now so you look at upwards of 500

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.450 
common now so you look at upwards of 500
tail<00:01:29.070> straight<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
tail straight with

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.300 
tail straight with
we<00:01:30.940> also<00:01:31.090> beefed<00:01:31.479> up<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> tip<00:01:32.049> screw<00:01:32.920> tip<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
we also beefed up the tip screw tip so

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.390 
we also beefed up the tip screw tip so
it's<00:01:33.430> less<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.790> break<00:01:34.090> off<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.659> then<00:01:35.500> see

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
it's less like a break off and then see

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.580 
it's less like a break off and then see
on<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.640> side<00:01:36.909> put<00:01:37.810> added<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.170> little<00:01:38.320> lip

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
on this side put added a little lip

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.800 
on this side put added a little lip
there<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.340> actually<00:01:39.490> drill<00:01:39.909> through<00:01:40.180> and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
there so to actually drill through and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.840 
there so to actually drill through and
pull<00:01:41.050> out<00:01:41.080> without<00:01:41.470> put<00:01:41.940> time<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.430> what<00:01:45.700> we're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
pull out without put time so what we're

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.859 
pull out without put time so what we're
cut<00:01:46.000> through<00:01:46.240> here<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.650> its<00:01:47.650> 22<00:01:47.890> by<00:01:48.220> sixes

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
cut through here is its 22 by sixes

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.120 
cut through here is its 22 by sixes
subtract<00:01:49.869> stacking<00:01:50.350> then<00:01:50.890> there's<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
subtract stacking then there's a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.560 
subtract stacking then there's a
stainless<00:01:51.490> steel<00:01:51.520> plate<00:01:51.909> which<00:01:52.300> is<00:01:52.420> pretty

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
stainless steel plate which is pretty

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:11.200 
stainless steel plate which is pretty
tough<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.930> get<00:01:53.050> through

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.820 

alright<00:02:12.210> so<00:02:12.420> we'll<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.690> cutting<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.320> what

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
alright so we'll be cutting this on what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
alright so we'll be cutting this on what
we<00:02:13.920> call<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> piece<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> stuff<00:02:14.670> pipe<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.240> two

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
