00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:03.600
 Marxist analysis 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.020

 under the banner support our kindergarten have played his thing 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.499
 it is rather a pace 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.269
 and that's what I was told 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.629
 and according to damien abad last they share room has the secret a 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.630
 secret well kept elsewhere because nobody has managed to achieve his 

00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:20.990
 surplus level this will not be simple 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.880
 and behind the tie alone 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 at my age 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.419
 here is thierry corbalan and his wife patricia 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.089
 inseparable this couple he forms so perfect notice 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 as a result of an accident thierry not lost both arms 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.280
 and endowed with a spirit of competitor thierry approved his strength to live in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.010
 the sport with a permanent support from his wife 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.740
 after more than nineteen years of running yes he participated in many 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.430
 marathons 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.060
 thierry time swimming and there is the click he trains 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.860
 several times a week 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.870
 laurent becomes his element like a dolphin he feels almost the most 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.810
 often from a range for over two years he discovered swimming with a 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 monopalme with the desire to go further and further 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.520
 it's my accident run by emotion born to water and start to 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 to eat on the back then very quickly he realizes that we hear 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.410
 in the form of the butterfly tribute I was much more effective 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 Gaddafi this rare tribute a handicap ansaldi basis May 23, 1988 to irritate 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.610
 products from then on a high-voltage line fishing party of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.250
 good family these amputations of both arms was inevitable about it the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 life to lead cool in seconds 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040
 after planning a series of flip-flops 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.640
 this assumes that the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.659
 this is the fact that I play sports that I am enormously trained 60% to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.190
 allowed to guess 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.500
 to stay alive 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.560
 and after in my daily fight at the islands the fort on the side of the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.850
 young fighters or transform 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.810
 you can also world's tuesday 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.220
 didier ridoret had to manage a surplus of energy 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.140
 by force of will 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 the solution was quickly found 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.169
 is that I got one of bronze right away we are in the sport 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.409
 but I was on my hospital bed I started doing abs at 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.569
 how could that work 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.340
 the staff had done a dive I began to pray for the race to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.340
 foot running because that strong that I could do 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.840
 how did I do judo moment 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.319
 after my accident the ground judo 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.559
 so I did the running 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.929
 I think to do a little bit for is more and more the most business to 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.479
 to do marathons and 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.599
 and then laughed two years ago I discovered passion and peace I 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.379
 decided to change sports 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.439
 patricia who led him in his resurrection today recognizes 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.439
 he is an exceptional man 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.379
 no one does not find brave they are very willing a little of his tunic 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.039
 a little much anguish 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.999
 you think 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.229
 it's serious 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.379
 but to give hope to all those who no longer believe in it 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.469
 fifty-year-old thierry corbalan had become the first disability and 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.719
 to cross the swimming equipped with a mono-palm the mouths of bonifacio in 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.579
 Corsican they are 15 km wide 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.359
 a crossing known for its contrary currents 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.899
 this place is not so easy to negotiate 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.139
 refueled every 30 minutes by frank bruno who was in a 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.269
 kayak thierry reaches his goal without much difficulty with hollows of a 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.019
 meter fifty-one crossing of five French hours the challenge is 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:32.659
 successful 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.829
 if ever easily it's true 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.099
 by working in these pictures game 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.109
 Giant in Paris was not too tired all that 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.649
 but me at the same time to rely on the blue jays with 30 clip 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:47.399
 who accompanied him with duty then he is not too fast to manage because 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.659
 that wind the hardest so in this style adventure is to manage is to go 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:51.369
 at the end 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.449
 so we took a slight safety margin on what allowed us to 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.329
 gaulle in museums 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.569
 not too exhausted anyway effects of the distances of growing 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.749
 long but it's true that I realized that 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:03.899
 when I swim 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.869
 along time after a while Belgium I'm a little center of my 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:10.489
 better and I will not go out of the water it's not original but the three young 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.629
 fish that gregated gills that pushes us 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.519
 I really went to the water 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.849
 patricia his wife 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.889
 and always the bourle support in all its choices 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.579
 she never feared the least concern 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.039
 for this reason of the possible 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.120
 for bangkok his followers of the workouts that went too long and 

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:30.949
 if we know that many think that a lot of fans will know if a 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.749
 child 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:37.020
 yes we took a big worry after the site 66 

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:37.909
 business 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.580
 I could never stop all that without I do not want to because 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.689
 that it's a lie 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.179
 he left in his alliance with Iran good for the crossing - beach of 

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:47.039
 pentrez 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.129
 it's very clear 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.710
 sankara 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.720
 promise to be at any time to jump if the road the races yourself 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.170
 six years of the mandate and to know no worries about plummeting is that this 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.819
 complex problem 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.509
 with this 7th goal of showing people with disabilities the whole thing is 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.449
 possible 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.639
 relayed by the greatest number his feat did not go unnoticed 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.650
 at the beginning I had done just that 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.380
 a call to send a message of hope to all people 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.400
 only different people 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400
 to show them that despite a Toyota accident that was possible 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.159
 she is the proof 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.610
 but I did not think it was going to be so important 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.740
 today that there is a normal life 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.020
 he made his disability a strength 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.960
 to such an extent he prefers his present life to that of before 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.430
 because today he is able to realize his dreams 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.139
 and to top it all 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.559
 he met the woman of his life 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.559
 he is a man of the road 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 we are seen together 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.279
 we live like any good 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:55.379

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.249
 we are not looking for complications 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.819

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.789

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:16.779
 golden years 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:17.689

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.459
