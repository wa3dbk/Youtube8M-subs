00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.380
 application that you have on your iphone 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.019
 whether it is like the jailbreak or 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.939
 installed of the appstore is this ticking 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.070

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.920
 so that you have it better is the big box 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.950
 that big boss already comes by default when 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.710
 you jailbreak for them 7 and good 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.860

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.150
 you will give him to install he will ask you 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.360

 I have a password for a moment 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.539
 a moment is worth asking for a password 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.369
 either repeat it and it's already 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.850
