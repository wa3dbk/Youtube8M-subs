00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello dear simson friends i once have 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.280
 again another video shot and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 Although I want to show you today how 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.380
 to get a simson motor in a legal way 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 and can do something faster 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 and that is about 2 today 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 Optimations I'll show you that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.390
 in short, the first optimization that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.000
 yes, here is the cylinder head sitting 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 he looks like this on the cylinder here 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 in the installed state in the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 engine and if you have the cylinder head 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.690
 then you can see that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.399
 the spark plug here shows that completely 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.440
 short 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.540
 There about two at the place 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.090
 millimeter into the combustion chamber protrudes 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 This naturally leads to that in the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 Incinerate here accordingly 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.850
 swirling happen because of the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 Flushing takes place here 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 cylinder head and you can now one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.780
 if I make the spark plug now 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 take out and then you can so the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 spark plug accordingly here at the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.449
 provided with a copper ring 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 I put it down 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 about one and a half millimeters in thickness 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.830
 and then when I turn the spark plug again 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.740
 in the combustion chamber pure screw that makes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.240
 that's very short 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.770
 then you see so clearly I know 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 that still dress properly now but 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.350
 I think so too 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.790
 already imagine very well 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 So you can see clearly here 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.250
 So that spark plug now here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 completes properly and flush 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.520
 Accordingly, then the flushing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 reasonable here too 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.829
 So that's the first optimization 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.630
 second optimization is the so-called 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.400
 Quetsch knew many people have there 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 maybe ever heard of heard the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 chatting crunching knew the distance 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.040
 between the piston and the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 cylinder head and here if the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
 piston goes up here results 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 he is not quite up to his head 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 ran but there remains a small 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 gap and this gap is the squeeze 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.469
 knew the butt of the plug here 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.469
 in the top of the cylinder and that comes 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.329
 here also almost ran to the edge and 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.939
 the column stops here between head and head 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.129
 The piston then arises that is the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.160
 So-called crash knew there are now 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.550
 a good option this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.990
 Aunt to measure in the installed state 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.170
 and that's what I take to show 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.550
 that's just a short piece of solder the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 LÃ¶w'schen should therefore at least 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.360
 one and a half to two millimeters thick 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 this one and a half is here now 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.180
 millimeter thick and that maniche pushes 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.740
 shows that it needs to be short 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 Take out the spark plug again with it 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:39.950
 you can imagine that, so you can 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.770
 bends the wire a bit crooked and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.790
 then you push the wire through the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.610
 Candle thread accordingly in this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.900
 position to the side and then the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.300
 piston comes from below and against against 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.710
 press this wire then presses the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.280
 wire together at the place 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.560
 then you take the advice out again and 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.650
 then you can use a caliper 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 just the one squeezed 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.670
 measure wire and then you know how strong 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.460
 I knew that squashed showed 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.570
 now here for a short time 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.180
 jacked motor so you take the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.620
 the candles stretch turns off the 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:26.570
 spark plug out and then you take yourself 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 the advice is here in the combustion chamber 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.660
 pure can be so on the side 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.940
 so now, for now 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.660
 take the kickstarter and press the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.470
 kickstarter once by moment so that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.510
 should be enough 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.480
 so now you can see a lot here 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.820
 it is clear that the wire is at the end 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.690
 is also compressed and if you are 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.270
 get in now 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.270
 it takes over I show that very briefly 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.030
 so zero again then you can here 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.530
 so the distance is fantastic 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.070
 and the distance should be so around the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.380
 0.8 to 0.9 millimeters then it is 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.220
 So very optimal for the production engine has 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.739
 So you usually one and a half to 17 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.650
 Millimeter squish knew some engines 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.220
 also have only one or 1.2 mm crimp 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.269
 So you should know 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.490
 try the squeeze could 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.870
 accordingly to optimize that one 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.060
 So on 0.8 to 0.9 mm is something 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.340
 if the forces are too big then 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.070
 you can sit here at the place yes 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.410
 the cylinder foot seal between there 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.460
 can you then according to 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.890
 get different directions 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.760
 I'll show it for a very short time 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.810
 I have two here now 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.450
 different strengths of once was her 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:54.440
 blue seal the national direction 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:58.620
 So Ultramat has 28 mm and the other one 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.990
 So the direction is 0.8 mm so that one 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.600
 so that can balance 16 already 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.210
 and when the ignition is still at 1.8 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.730
 millimeter before ot and the carburettor 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.860
 is reasonably optimized then let 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.860
 Thus, end speeds of 70 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.660
 reach 75 km h and you can tell 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.820
 already clear and you have in the yes 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.680
 do not intervene technically so 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.530
 that one is therefore lawfully on the 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.240
 safe side is okay i hope i 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.070
 could help you a bit and 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.520
 I wish you a nice day until 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.520
 dance
