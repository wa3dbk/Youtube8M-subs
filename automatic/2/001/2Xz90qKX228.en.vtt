 a visual orgasm during the first 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 view that I had the game during the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 in the tweet channel which I'm going 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.510

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.480
 information they have to see 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.840
 directly with this game the most 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.670
 possible to the channel so guys are we going to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.760
 give play to this and this was what it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.550
 presented during e3 this morning 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.780
 attention guys it's really brutal 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.780
 own project when 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 other 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 twitch 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.590
 good 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.040
 sometimes 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.130
 wow guys there you have it this 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.700
 was the official announcement of the both is 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.950
 against zombies garden warfare 2 eye 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.870
 interesting details is that take super 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.310
 in mind the official launch will be 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.410
 for 2016 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.090
 in the spring I can say that this 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.770
 date will be very similar to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.440
 launch of the first garden warfare 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.870
 about the month of March maybe 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.700
 for the month of April how much will be 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.100
 will be coming to our consoles 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.960
 another super important detail and that I should 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.960
 to make it clear until this moment 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.250
 only availability was announced 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.890
 of this game for xbox one consoles 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.680
 playstation 4 ipc not announced 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.360
 absolutely nothing that will be for 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.740
 last generation ok 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.870
 I want to make it very clear because many 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.910
 people get confused on this issue that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.200
 when for old consoles and all that 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.700
 theme guys 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.470
 it is now announced that it will only be 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.690
 for new generations 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.290
 now many characters were seen 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.040
 new guys is amazing characters 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.750
 both futuristic characters so much with a 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.750
 look a bit old but 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.910
 of the current garden warfare sale 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.470
 many variants of the characters 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.989
 it's amazing in Bern you see this 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.579
 kind of robot in which a 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.160
 little hat to see the go to the character 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.860
 this orange one type orange boat 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.230
 something something incredible account there it looked 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.110
 which has as a kind of shield and 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.830
 an interesting guys you notice that the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.870
 atmosphere of what is the trailer it shows 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.880
 like they are in a zombie environment 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.580
 I want to say that constructions 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.310
 little houses that looked more or less out there 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.290
 in the video they are like zombie habitat 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.050
 ksa will remind you of the garden warfare one 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.900
 everything had as atmosphere that 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.430
 they were like the habitat of the plants 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.350
 as if the zombies invaded the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.270
 plants this time in that trailer 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.830
 I perceive it in a contrary way as 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.870
 if now the plants reach where 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.690
 are the zombies something something like that or 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 least I understand and nothing really 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.530
 that you notice super super cool kid 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.060
 these are my second impressions of 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.470
 trailer I just saw it for second 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.720

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.980

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.590
 I had quite big emotions 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.660

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.490
