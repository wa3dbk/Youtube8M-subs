it's the best time ever in the history
of<00:02:06.180> game<00:02:06.360> whether<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.350> get<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.500> same

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
of game whether they get the same

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.080 
of game whether they get the same
satisfaction<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.520> other<00:02:08.670> day<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:08.940> know

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
satisfaction the other day I don't know

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690 
satisfaction the other day I don't know
so<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.020> happy<00:02:10.200> doing<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.619> doing<00:02:10.709> if

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so I'm happy doing what I'm doing if

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
so I'm happy doing what I'm doing if
there's<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.180> rule

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
there's one rule

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.559 
there's one rule
were<00:02:12.870> allowed<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> change<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.890> cricket<00:02:14.569> right

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
were allowed to change in cricket right

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.900 
were allowed to change in cricket right
now<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> think<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.950> batsman<00:02:17.310> backing<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.849> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
now I think the batsman backing up is a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.540 
now I think the batsman backing up is a
ridiculous<00:02:18.420> rule<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.190> massive

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
ridiculous rule it's a it's a massive

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.650 
ridiculous rule it's a it's a massive
advantage<00:02:20.819> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> batting<00:02:21.360> team<00:02:21.450> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
advantage for the batting team that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.850 
advantage for the batting team that
they're<00:02:21.780> three<00:02:21.989> hours<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.319> track<00:02:22.530> before<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
they're three hours on track before the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.470 
they're three hours on track before the
guy<00:02:22.980> bowls<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> don't<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.970> don't<00:02:24.060> get

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
guy bowls of all I don't I don't get

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.870 
guy bowls of all I don't I don't get
that<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> don't<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.080> point<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:26.580> you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that I don't see the point of it if you

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.280 
that I don't see the point of it if you
if<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.360> price<00:02:27.690> was<00:02:27.989> right

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
