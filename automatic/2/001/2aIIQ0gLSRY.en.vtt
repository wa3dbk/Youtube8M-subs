00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
are as good as you thought they were

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.830

when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.680> were<00:01:25.860> initially

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.770 

probably<00:01:29.840> probably<00:01:31.150> how<00:01:32.150> difficult<00:01:32.450> was<00:01:32.630> this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
probably probably how difficult was this

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480 
probably probably how difficult was this
game<00:01:32.930> four<00:01:33.200> players<00:01:33.680> party<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.130> weekend<00:01:34.460> and

game four players party this weekend and
the<00:01:34.640> moves<00:01:34.850> it's<00:01:35.330> not<00:01:35.450> even<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.780> say<00:01:35.930> that

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
the moves it's not even to say that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.240 
the moves it's not even to say that
they've<00:01:36.229> got<00:01:36.350> nothing<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.680> play<00:01:36.830> for<00:01:36.860> that

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
they've got nothing to play for that

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.280 
they've got nothing to play for that
make<00:01:37.490> them<00:01:37.640> more<00:01:37.729> danger<00:01:38.119> yeah<00:01:38.570> because<00:01:39.050> I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
make them more danger yeah because I

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.370 
make them more danger yeah because I
think<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.560> s<00:01:40.550> difficult<00:01:40.940> because<00:01:41.300> I<00:01:41.540> watched

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
think that s difficult because I watched

the game against arsenal yes United it's

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.560 
the game against arsenal yes United it's
clearly<00:01:48.560> when<00:01:48.800> they<00:01:49.250> consider<00:01:49.729> wall<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.390> wall

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
clearly when they consider wall to wall

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.230 
clearly when they consider wall to wall
after<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.850> difficult<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:53.860> when<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.979> game

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
after was difficult but when the game

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.930 
after was difficult but when the game
started<00:01:56.240> Wars<00:01:56.930> play<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> percent<00:01:58.220> for

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.080 
no I think that there are some moment in
the<00:03:35.180> season<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.280> do<00:03:37.400> as<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.670> mistake

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the season that you can do as a mistake

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.230 
the season that you can do as a mistake
we<00:03:38.480> did<00:03:38.630> some<00:03:38.870> mistake<00:03:39.230> i<00:03:39.260> think<00:03:39.650> but<00:03:43.060> when<00:03:44.060> we

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
we did some mistake i think but when we

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.840 
we did some mistake i think but when we
lose<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.450> schedule<00:03:45.230> for<00:03:45.740> that<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.580> mighty

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
lose a schedule for that to be a mighty

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.590 
lose a schedule for that to be a mighty
that<00:03:47.090> that<00:03:47.690> was<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.430> key<00:03:49.430> moment<00:03:49.640> because<00:03:50.570> we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
that that was a key moment because we

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.250 
that that was a key moment because we
need<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.430> draw<00:03:52.430> but<00:03:53.270> i<00:03:53.300> think<00:03:53.600> that<00:03:53.630> we<00:03:53.870> set<00:03:54.080> up

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
need to draw but i think that we set up

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.330 
need to draw but i think that we set up
already<00:03:55.150> with<00:03:56.150> other<00:03:56.360> chance<00:03:57.190> which<00:03:58.190> is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
already with other chance which is

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.980 
already with other chance which is
contact<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.000> your<00:03:59.210> first<00:03:59.420> remarks<00:03:59.900> it

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
with the frustration the things you

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.430 
with the frustration the things you
can't<00:04:02.360> control<00:04:02.480> other<00:04:02.960> people's<00:04:03.290> games

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
can't control other people's games

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.650 
can't control other people's games
decisions<00:04:04.100> take<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> times<00:04:05.090> not<00:04:05.300> handle

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
decisions take the times not handle

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.420
