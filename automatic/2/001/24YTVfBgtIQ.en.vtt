00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.350
 well it him everyone is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 valentin for the test string in all 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.560
 kind and so today I 'm doing this 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.460
 video to show you my theme 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.250
 windows phone 8 8 sorry so I have 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 installed on my android so one can 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.039
 see that it's google 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.920
 google you can see also in my 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.500
 other videos in the example that my 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 theme was not the same 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.060
 it was until then I was charged so a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 little application I wanted you to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 show because it's really not bad 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.980
 I am really satisfied I think 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 really that I will keep her 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 so I customize I just have the museum 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 all that for example you clicked if 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 long time you select whatever 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 thing and if you go in the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.289
 settings so had the cheating that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.829
 is called a sting and you put this 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.629
 you want the color the size 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.350
 So that's really what we 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.360
 not found on windows phone 7 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.680
 you really need it and it goes 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.330
 take into account the messages when we 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.369
 will receive it will put a little 1 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
 it's really not bad I put 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.630
 their ranks first try but so 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 more than I feel particularly here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.009
 do I use the least so here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.200
 all other applications can 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.530
 even do a search by pressing here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 you type for example f of facebook and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.360
 you on facebook or so that's 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 it really is not bad 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.000
 I think that I think it's good and so 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 you can see here that I choose 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 the home screen that I want to geagea that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.590
 so that's my my basic launcher 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.880
 here and so bleach 7 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 I will make another video on 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 as the set for the show you some 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.649
 but for now I'm going to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.439
 so focus a little on the 8 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.329
 what I really find that there is 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.290
 So that's what it's mine when I 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.149
 will click home 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.810
 that's it brings me back here and when we want 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.020
 unlock 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.729
 so voila everything will be changed here I 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.100
 can also see that when I charge 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.640
 the device then it is in the other direction 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.200
 but now he puts me plugged so I like 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.040
 well these icons it really does 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.180
 really many cities like this you 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.800
 want to put a code it's always 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.830
 like you go in the settings we have 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.620
 a little app application setting 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 so it's exactly the same you 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.040
 choose and it always brings you back 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.070
 here so here I have all my apps 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.890
 that I imitate the one I use 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.440
 often as I told you so for 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.150
 download all this we will go to the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.530
 when there is no application set 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.160

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.080
 an application and therefore installs it's 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.410
 an application in English but knowing 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.150
 that does not really bother you because in the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.170
 settings you see that we can 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.400
 easily understand which pic collage 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.780
 here we can see quite easily 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.430
 understandable even in English you 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.650
 touch two months English is easy 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.600
 here we always keep the bar of 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.730
 here 2 notifications from android is here 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.890
 you choose the app you go the 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.390
 color you want earlier if you 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.350
 do I want to show you with the yellow I 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.240
 do not think it could really 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.980
 choose the color you want if 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.870
 for example you want to make yellow 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.850
 and blue 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.780
 that's it I 'm in the tech settings 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.500
 yellow 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.570
 ok here we can do everything in blue 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.090
 everything in yellow all the color you 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.670
 want here we even have one for the gallery 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.570
 so scrolling pictures you 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.060
 could that be it was mathieu gaye that you 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.800
 so can changed as you want here 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.130
 we click I do not know what it's like 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.750
 that's what they're defined so it's not 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.050
 really useful it updates 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.050
 automatically 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.280
 and so that's all for this theme 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.930
 you that you can choose between 7 and 8 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.150
 personally I choose 8 so I have 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.950
 tested the 7 anyway and I'm going to 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.350
 tell the difference is that on the set 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.360
 when we are going to press there we will not be able to 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.610
 reduce the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.640
 the name is called kill it he sees there 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.810
 down we can not reduce it 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.630
 they are all parts and like that 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.170
 so it's all square of two 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.210
 rows away like that so here's me 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.730
 personally I intended to redeem myself 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.220
 a phone just for the theme because 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.710
 that I really like it but when I 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.440
 see that it's really beautiful we have 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.180
 so under water I'm going to lighten 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.660
 with a color that comes you can 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.880
 choose the app that's going to be 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.880
 open you 're going to click and I 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.460
 will show you in a moment then 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.870
 it was a blue so I hope this 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:15.690
 and I showed you so when we go 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:18.240
 click here no it does not work for not 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.860
 serious actually on the fact what I 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.500
 wanted to tell you is that on the set 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.940
 when we are going to click and well the beans to 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.170
 breite the same the tiles are going to get 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.230
 close the good that name 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.790
 so that was all for this theme 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:36.050
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.050
