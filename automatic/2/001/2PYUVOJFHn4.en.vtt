00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
in the very early stages of survival I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.090 
in the very early stages of survival I
wanted<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> wait<00:00:16.379> until<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.619> could<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.830> sort<00:00:17.039> of

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
into the mid game in late game before I

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400 
into the mid game in late game before I
reviewed<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.750> I<00:00:21.750> still<00:00:22.050> don't<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.289> if

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

point and so I feel like I've do it and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.089 
point and so I feel like I've do it and
the<00:00:29.279> survival<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:29.939> tough<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:31.099> meat

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099

there's crafting in the game as you

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.399 
there's crafting in the game as you
level<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.320> gain<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.900> anger<00:01:39.900> points<00:01:40.290> which

um<00:02:08.590> there's<00:02:09.580> social<00:02:09.970> mechanics<00:02:10.509> their<00:02:10.660> tribes

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
um there's social mechanics their tribes

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.870 
um there's social mechanics their tribes
it's<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.680> little<00:02:11.890> clunky<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.370> now<00:02:12.550> but

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it's a little clunky right now but

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000 
it's a little clunky right now but
essentially<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.020> join<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.380> tribe<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
essentially you can join a tribe it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.770 
essentially you can join a tribe it
permits<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.000> access<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.600> choice

we did last night I don't know how we
would<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.380> done<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.709> without<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.820> one

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
would I done have without with just one

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
would I done have without with just one
I<00:02:40.209> don't<00:02:40.480> think<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.660> what<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.870> works<00:02:41.019> um<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:44.220> one

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I don't think it what it works um so one

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190 
I don't think it what it works um so one
thing<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.670> note<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.780> thing<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.019> in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
thing to note is that this thing is in

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.949 
thing to note is that this thing is in
alpha<00:02:47.590> its<00:02:48.150> performance<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.300> optimization

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
alpha its performance and optimization

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.009 
alpha its performance and optimization
are<00:02:50.140> pretty<00:02:50.650> rough<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.450> would<00:02:52.450> say<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.780> you're

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
are pretty rough I would say if you're

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.340 
are pretty rough I would say if you're
on<00:02:53.200> particular<00:02:54.100> if<00:02:54.190> you're<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.430> an<00:02:54.640> aging

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
on particular if you're on an aging

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
significantly and you can see this is a

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.120 
significantly and you can see this is a
base<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.670> felt<00:03:03.880> over<00:03:04.150> here<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:05.890> and

base that we felt over here and so and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.710
