00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that's like saying define God and give

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.080 
that's like saying define God and give
three<00:00:32.160> examples

which was sir which was a series of
lectures<00:00:52.559> delivered<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.190> Harbor<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.120> second

lectures delivered at Harbor the second
part<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.050> deals<00:00:55.290> with<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.399> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
part of it deals with that very thing so

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.319 
part of it deals with that very thing so
let<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:56.969> start<00:00:57.329> off<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.719> best<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.409> I<00:00:58.559> can

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
let me start off as best as I can

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.469 
let me start off as best as I can
first<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.600> believe<00:01:01.159> that<00:01:02.159> truth<00:01:02.519> as<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.850> category

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
first I believe that truth as a category

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
first I believe that truth as a category
does<00:01:03.839> exist<00:01:05.119> number<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.690> possible<00:01:07.470> in

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
does exist number two it is possible in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.669 
does exist number two it is possible in
a<00:01:08.250> majority<00:01:08.910> of<00:01:09.179> claims<00:01:09.509> of<00:01:09.899> philosophical

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:10.679 
a majority of claims of philosophical

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.490 
a majority of claims of philosophical
and<00:01:10.830> historical<00:01:11.119> statements<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.630> verify<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and historical statements to verify the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880 
and historical statements to verify the
truthfulness<00:01:14.039> of<00:01:14.399> those<00:01:14.759> affirmations<00:01:15.890> third

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
truthfulness of those affirmations third

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
truthfulness of those affirmations third
I<00:01:17.159> believe<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.090> existential

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I believe there are existential

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.889 
I believe there are existential
realities<00:01:19.710> from<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.429> cannot<00:01:20.789> run<00:01:21.090> which

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
realities from which I cannot run which

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.350 
realities from which I cannot run which
drive<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> find<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.429> answers<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
drive me to find the answers to the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.389 
drive me to find the answers to the
existential<00:01:24.990> struggles<00:01:25.679> that<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.920> live<00:01:26.220> with

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
existential struggles that I live with

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.520 
existential struggles that I live with
not<00:01:26.819> just<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.179> philosophical<00:01:27.899> ones<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
not just the philosophical ones the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
not just the philosophical ones the
philosophical<00:01:29.250> ones<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.670> real<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.420> have

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
philosophical ones are real and I have

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
philosophical ones are real and I have
to<00:01:30.810> deal<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.319> but<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to deal with them but so are the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.969 
to deal with them but so are the
existential<00:01:32.819> ones<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.330> by<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.539> way

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
existential ones and by the way

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
existential ones and by the way
existentialism<00:01:34.979> came<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.789> a<00:01:35.819> respond<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
existentialism came as a respond to the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
existentialism came as a respond to the
unpaid<00:01:37.200> bills<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.890> philosophy<00:01:38.490> philosophy

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
unpaid bills of philosophy philosophy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
unpaid bills of philosophy philosophy
had<00:01:39.450> become<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.960> cerebral<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> passions

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
had become so cerebral that the passions

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
had become so cerebral that the passions
have<00:01:41.909> been<00:01:42.090> ignored<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.770> existentialism

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have been ignored and existentialism

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
have been ignored and existentialism
came<00:01:44.070> into<00:01:44.250> being<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.640> sort<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> tossed<00:01:45.210> out

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
came into being and sort of tossed out

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.090 
came into being and sort of tossed out
the<00:01:45.719> rationalistic<00:01:46.469> way<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> interpreting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the rationalistic way of interpreting

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
the rationalistic way of interpreting
things<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.820> went<00:01:48.270> purely<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.079> gut

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
things and went purely with the gut

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499 
things and went purely with the gut
level<00:01:49.799> feeling<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> la<00:01:50.430> Sartre<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.030> Camus<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
level feeling a la Sartre and Camus and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.319 
level feeling a la Sartre and Camus and
so<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.789> are<00:01:53.939> trying<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so on but I think what we are trying to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
so on but I think what we are trying to
do<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.930> trying<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> find<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
do is if we are trying to find the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
do is if we are trying to find the
bridge<00:01:56.159> between<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.759> head<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> heart

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
bridge between the head and the heart

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.649 
bridge between the head and the heart
there<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.740> numerous<00:01:59.219> ways<00:01:59.549> of<00:02:00.030> doing<00:02:00.329> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
there are numerous ways of doing this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.350 
there are numerous ways of doing this
and<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> way<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.740> start<00:02:02.310> off<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.549> by<00:02:03.000> saying
