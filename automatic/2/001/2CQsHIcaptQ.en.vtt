00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
silenced and I think it might be the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.520 
silenced and I think it might be the
semtex<00:00:44.090> with<00:00:45.090> i<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:45.899> might<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.079> stunned

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
semtex with i think i might be stunned

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.880 
semtex with i think i might be stunned
and<00:00:47.000> it's<00:00:48.000> some<00:00:48.390> domination<00:00:49.170> i'm<00:00:49.410> pretty<00:00:49.710> sure

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and it's some domination i'm pretty sure

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.330 
and it's some domination i'm pretty sure
it's<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> ground<00:00:50.250> war<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.210> yeah<00:00:51.690> burps<00:00:52.260> uh<00:00:52.590> perks
