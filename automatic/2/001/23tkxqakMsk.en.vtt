dangerous<00:03:17.260> for<00:03:17.890> us<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.430> think<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
dangerous for us and I think that the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.120 
dangerous for us and I think that the
one<00:03:19.540> thing<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.810> was<00:03:20.019> evident<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.650> me<00:03:20.680> was

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
one thing that was evident to me was

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.310 
one thing that was evident to me was
because<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:22.060> his<00:03:22.180> movement<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.019> stretch

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
because of his movement and a stretch

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.180 
because of his movement and a stretch
lagina<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:24.329> load<00:03:25.329> Frank<00:03:25.780> Musa<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.590> space<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:27.070> go
