00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 hello everyone today brought another 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:23.400
 the tuner means when you turn off the attack time 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.220
 strip and it's all over this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:36.680
 ie further loading is not 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:40.500
 unplug the need of the problems and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.590
 as likely as any other 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.910
 time is most common in different 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.910
 types of idols in different manufacturers 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:02.149
 some here are just clones 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.149
 that is fixing each other 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.780
 that is, the principle they have here 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.620
 standard problem but povyalelo 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:36.310
 a little more on swell alla 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:48.390
 capacitors times two three 4 5 6 6 pieces 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:48.390
 need to change and here's another 7 bottom flowed 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:02:20.050
 now we will change 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:28.060
 and look at the result of this here 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:30.750
 was replaced by me that's what we have 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.750
 happened 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.680
 now we set to check 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.780
 immediately closing because i'm sure 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.780
 that everything will work fine 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:04:05.720
 and turn on 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:37.310
 the tuner booted swinging turns on well 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.080
 i.e. this is a standard problem 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.100
 the most common can be said on 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 these tournaments there is in principle and if 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:57.540
 everybody can guarantee this 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:00.180
 thereby saving both time and money 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.420
 This is all thank you for your attention and to the new 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.420
 meeting
