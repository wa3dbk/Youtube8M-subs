winter diving UK or similar conditions

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.240 
winter diving UK or similar conditions
and<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.640> look<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.970> regulator<00:00:21.570> itself<00:00:22.250> we

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and we look at the regulator itself we

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130 
and we look at the regulator itself we
start<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:23.640> stage<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
start on the first stage this is the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.880 
start on the first stage this is the
apex<00:00:26.010> FS<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:26.760> first<00:00:27.300> stage<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> very

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
apex FS our first stage is a very

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
apex FS our first stage is a very
high-performing<00:00:29.849> diaphragm<00:00:30.750> balance<00:00:31.170> system

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
high-performing diaphragm balance system

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
high-performing diaphragm balance system
so<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.160> give<00:00:32.279> me<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> great<00:00:32.640> performance<00:00:33.090> any

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
so there give me a great performance any

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.160 
so there give me a great performance any
cylinder<00:00:34.200> pressure<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:35.010> any<00:00:35.160> depth<00:00:36.170> its

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
cylinder pressure and at any depth its

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.660 
cylinder pressure and at any depth its
environmentally<00:00:37.739> sealed<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.160> well<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.550> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
environmentally sealed as well so it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 
environmentally sealed as well so it's
giving<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.059> cold<00:00:39.329> water<00:00:39.450> rating<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
giving that cold water rating and it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.889 
giving that cold water rating and it
helps<00:00:40.829> basically<00:00:41.460> prevent<00:00:41.850> routering<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
helps basically prevent routering to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
helps basically prevent routering to
actually<00:00:43.170> move<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> parts<00:00:43.649> inside<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.520> also

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
actually move the parts inside and also

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
actually move the parts inside and also
helps<00:00:45.120> prevent<00:00:45.390> contamination<00:00:46.289> damaging<00:00:46.980> any

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
helps prevent contamination damaging any

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.709 
helps prevent contamination damaging any
of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> soft<00:00:47.670> components<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.329> earrings

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
of the soft components like earrings

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
of the soft components like earrings
they're<00:00:49.200> actually<00:00:49.440> inside<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> regulator's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
they're actually inside the regulator's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
they're actually inside the regulator's
so<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.239> cold<00:00:51.570> water<00:00:51.719> protection<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.410> also

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so it's a cold water protection and also

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.380 
so it's a cold water protection and also
helps<00:00:53.340> prolong<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.820> life<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.539> regulator

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
helps prolong the life of the regulator

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
helps prolong the life of the regulator

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.430 
stage you can either have it in high
performance<00:02:11.310> whereas

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
performance whereas

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.350 
performance whereas
towards<00:02:12.860> mouthpiece<00:02:13.340> or<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.120> put<00:02:14.270> it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
towards mouthpiece or you can put it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.390 
towards mouthpiece or you can put it
into<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.600> like<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.050> safety<00:02:15.350> mode<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.980> it's

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
into a like a safety mode and it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.520 
into a like a safety mode and it's
directing<00:02:16.910> air<00:02:17.120> back<00:02:17.600> towards<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.020> diaphragm

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
directing air back towards a diaphragm

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.290 
directing air back towards a diaphragm
and<00:02:18.710> sort<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.980> helping<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.460> prevent<00:02:19.760> free

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and sort of helping to prevent free

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.130 
and sort of helping to prevent free
flows<00:02:21.310> also<00:02:22.310> got<00:02:22.460> inhalation<00:02:23.120> control<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.080> if

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
flows also got inhalation control so if

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.980 
flows also got inhalation control so if
it<00:02:24.260> need<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.450> increase<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
it need to be you can increase the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.740 
it need to be you can increase the
resistance<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.920> valve<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:29.480> make<00:02:29.600> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
resistance on the valve to make it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
resistance on the valve to make it
slightly<00:02:29.930> harder<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.320> brave<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
slightly harder to brave so if it's a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.330 
slightly harder to brave so if it's a
redundant<00:02:32.000> system<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:33.020> could<00:02:33.260> wind<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.310> down

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
redundant system you could wind it down

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.130 
redundant system you could wind it down
make<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.120> little<00:02:35.240> bit<00:02:35.360> harder<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.690> brave<00:02:35.960> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
make it a little bit harder to brave and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.660 
make it a little bit harder to brave and
also<00:02:36.380> you're<00:02:36.560> helping<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:36.890> prevent<00:02:37.250> any<00:02:37.460> free

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
also you're helping to prevent any free

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.770 
also you're helping to prevent any free
flow<00:02:37.880> conditions<00:02:39.820> on<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.120> front<00:02:41.360> you've<00:02:41.750> got

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
flow conditions on the front you've got

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.280 
flow conditions on the front you've got
a<00:02:42.220> nice<00:02:43.220> easy<00:02:43.550> purge<00:02:44.060> button<00:02:44.360> but<00:02:45.080> you've<00:02:45.170> also

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
a nice easy purge button but you've also

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.910 
a nice easy purge button but you've also
got<00:02:45.670> minimal<00:02:46.750> vents<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:48.500> get<00:02:48.680> at<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
got minimal vents to get at the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.520 
got minimal vents to get at the
diaphragm<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.700> there's<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.300> much<00:02:51.260> reduced

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
diaphragm so there's a much reduced

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.100 
diaphragm so there's a much reduced
chance<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.880> strong<00:02:53.270> cone<00:02:53.510> actually

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
chance of a strong cone actually

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.990 
chance of a strong cone actually
interacting<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.280> diaphragm<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
interacting with the diaphragm and

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.610 
interacting with the diaphragm and
causing<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.450> free<00:02:56.630> flow<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.290> again<00:02:57.470> you've

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
causing your free flow so again you've

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.580 
causing your free flow so again you've
got<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.740> nice<00:02:57.920> safety<00:02:58.250> feature<00:02:58.400> there<00:02:59.590> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
got a nice safety feature there the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.040 
got a nice safety feature there the
whole<00:03:00.740> housing<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.490> reversible<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
whole housing is reversible so if you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.810 
whole housing is reversible so if you
want<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.290> change<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.710> to<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.860> left-hand<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.610> a

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
want to change it to a left-hand for a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.160 
want to change it to a left-hand for a
tech<00:03:05.030> diving<00:03:05.420> less<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.720> twin<00:03:05.930> set

tech diving less on the twin set

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.840 
tech diving less on the twin set
something<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:07.370> can<00:03:07.610> get<00:03:07.820> a

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
something like that you can get a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.180 
something like that you can get a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
with the much smaller version and it's

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.940 
with the much smaller version and it's
changed<00:03:47.690> within<00:03:47.959> seconds<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.800> there's<00:03:48.920> a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
changed within seconds so there's a
