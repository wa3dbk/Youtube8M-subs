00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
what I've added a little bit more detail

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
what I've added a little bit more detail
on<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.420> outside<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:56.309> these<00:00:56.520> slow<00:00:57.090> pieces

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
on the outside and put these slow pieces

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290 
on the outside and put these slow pieces
up<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.829> good<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> then

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
up here I think that looks good and then

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.759 
up here I think that looks good and then
these<00:01:00.449> are<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.079> 1<00:01:02.070> by<00:01:02.219> 8<00:01:02.430> plates<00:01:02.850> on

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.620 
these are just like 1 by 8 plates on
Brooks<00:01:04.769> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.010> studs<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> side<00:01:06.270> there

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
Brooks with the studs on the side there

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050 
Brooks with the studs on the side there
but<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.710> does<00:01:07.950> give<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.580> nice<00:01:08.729> little

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
but it really does give some nice little

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740 
but it really does give some nice little
detail<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:10.520> finally<00:01:11.520> got<00:01:11.729> another<00:01:12.150> windows

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
detail I finally got another windows

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.060 
detail I finally got another windows

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
waiting on that and put that in there I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.270 
waiting on that and put that in there I
went<00:01:17.070> ahead<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.310> built<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:18.360> doors<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.409> the

sheet so I went and put that there

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940 
sheet so I went and put that there
that's<00:02:11.489> kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.170> employees<00:02:13.170> only

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
that's kind of like employees only

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
that's kind of like employees only
keep<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.780> didn't<00:02:16.020> do<00:02:16.110> nothing<00:02:16.410> over

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
keep out and I didn't do nothing over

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.830 
keep out and I didn't do nothing over
here<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.220> storage<00:02:18.209> area<00:02:18.569> where<00:02:18.720> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
here in the storage area where you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.559 
here in the storage area where you
unload<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> truck<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> stairs<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.420> up

what<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.019> thinking<00:02:22.349> about<00:02:22.410> doing<00:02:22.680> here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
what I was thinking about doing here

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.390 
what I was thinking about doing here
though<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.540> probably<00:02:24.540> adding<00:02:24.959> one<00:02:25.230> more

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
though was probably adding one more

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.640 
though was probably adding one more
height<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> brown<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.500> razor

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
height to the brown kind of razor

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.890 
height to the brown kind of razor
because<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:28.950> did<00:02:29.160> raise<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.760> walls<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
because I did raise the walls up a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.300 
because I did raise the walls up a
little<00:02:31.080> bit<00:02:31.200> more<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.620> kind<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.099> that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
little bit more to kind of get that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.380 
little bit more to kind of get that
slope<00:02:33.239> look<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:34.800> at<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> front

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
slope look you see there at the front

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.460 
slope look you see there at the front
well<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> guys<00:02:36.630> let<00:02:36.840> me<00:02:36.870> know<00:02:36.959> what<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.260> think

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470

well you guys let me know what you think
I<00:02:37.739> think<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:38.040> coming<00:02:38.250> along<00:02:38.370> pretty<00:02:38.670> good

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
I think it's coming along pretty good

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030 
I think it's coming along pretty good
and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.049> tell<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> second<00:02:40.799> floor

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and I will tell you the second floor

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250 
and I will tell you the second floor
will<00:02:41.849> probably<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.390> come<00:02:42.750> straight<00:02:43.230> out

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
will probably just come straight out

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.229 
will probably just come straight out
like<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.739> kind<00:02:44.069> of<00:02:44.099> like<00:02:44.220> an<00:02:44.310> overhang<00:02:44.760> and

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
like this kind of like an overhang and

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.430 
like this kind of like an overhang and
it'll<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.780> red<00:02:46.110> bricks<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.360> top<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
it'll be red bricks on the top on the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.890 
it'll be red bricks on the top on the
front<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:50.250> around<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.420> back<00:02:51.450> we'll

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
front and then around the back we'll

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.080 
front and then around the back we'll
pause<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.440> gray<00:02:52.769> mixed<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.849> kind<00:02:54.030> of

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
pause this be gray mixed in it's kind of

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
pause this be gray mixed in it's kind of
what<00:02:54.180> I'm<00:02:54.239> thinking<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.840> mean<00:02:55.739> that's<00:02:55.920> kind<00:02:56.160> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
what I'm thinking I mean that's kind of

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.940 
what I'm thinking I mean that's kind of
what<00:02:56.370> they<00:02:56.489> show<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.849> book<00:02:57.860> probably<00:02:58.860> do

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
what they show in the book probably do

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.229 
what they show in the book probably do
something<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.819> mean<00:03:00.000> there's

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
something like that I mean there's

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.600 
something like that I mean there's
different<00:03:00.810> colors<00:03:01.380> everything<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.220> it's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
different colors everything and it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
different colors everything and it's
really<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.739> different<00:03:04.739> kind<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.519> style<00:03:06.299> right

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
really a different kind of style right

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.319 
really a different kind of style right
in<00:03:06.840> here<00:03:07.079> but<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.799> mean<00:03:08.489> mine's<00:03:08.910> not<00:03:09.090> as

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
in here but I mean mine's not as

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.819 
in here but I mean mine's not as
detailed<00:03:09.630> but<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.530> looks<00:03:10.560> pretty

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
detailed but I think it looks pretty

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.589 
detailed but I think it looks pretty
good<00:03:11.099> but<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.819> guys<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:12.239> know<00:03:12.329> what<00:03:12.480> you
