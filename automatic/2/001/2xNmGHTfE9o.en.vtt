00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.940
 relatively recently and revised 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.030
 film adaptation of the adventures of two heads 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 astrix a and obelix and despite the fact that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.150
 these films are adaptations 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.490
 several animated parts 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.529
 the source of all this is comics 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 coming out of a distant bin network in this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.369
 year the first two parts turned out 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.810
 really worthwhile and not looking 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.340
 your age is still 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 looks decent able to make laugh 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 but here are the next two parts and lost 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.349
 all for which we are so fond of 1 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 dilogy 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.850
 and if part 3 still somehow tried 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 save the first two features in a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.129
 features of the second part then in the fourth 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 everything covered with a copper basin with each 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.370
 the subsequent reconsideration did not begin to notice 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.219
 some details that I personally have 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.170
 began to raise certain questions and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.170
 furious keeps my logic scope 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.160
 in theory, all four parts are combined 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.910
 common plot lines occur in one 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.860
 cinema universe 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.510
 and if you start from this fact 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.250
 there are many contradictions 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.820
 which violates the integrity of this 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.910
 of the universe 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:18.950
 oh how i bent okay actually them 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:20.600
 not much but if i already started it 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.729
 ok if standing is not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.780
 historically authentic it is all not 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.670
 documentaries 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.190
 but this does not mean that logic can 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.229
 it seems to me to go for a walk or Caesar 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.360
 something more you would change his image from 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.149
 film film not only my appearance 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.640
 character's age or he lived like a doctor 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.410
 who regenerates in childhood is not even 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.330
 attached particular importance to this 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.140
 believed that caesar is a type 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.210
 title but now what the hell is that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.759
 if you can not continue to work with 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.649
 actor for some reason, then 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.640
 replace and take into account the parameters so to speak 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.160
 one 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.229
 not only age but also appearance otherwise 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.700
 there is some confusion if 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.039
 accept the fact that this one too 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.649
 Caesar As silly as it may sound it 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.319
 then first comes the mission Cleopatra 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.929
 then against Caesar then Britain then 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.970
 games but the stock in the first movie because they 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.810
 only there to meet him a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.319
 subsequent parts they already know and do not 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.349
 head ache 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.730
 Okay, if the operation on the history of Caesar 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 in the first and second film in its own way 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.720
 age plow more real 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.610
 Caesar's movie action always happens 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.950
 the fiftieth year before the birth of Christ 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.569
 them there that time loop or something they 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.790
 and so all quickly have time for one year and 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.980
 he died six years later that is forty 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.220
 the fourth year at the time of death he was 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.250
 fifty five years mean movies him 49 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 first film 57 years old actor protection yourself 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.050
 Caesar the second film 43 years 3 77 4 60 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.940
 okay enough to mock yulia so 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.660
 over it already and so have a headache 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.810
 and move on to the most important 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.060
 asterix 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.700
 in the first and second film he was excellent 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.800
 played by an actor to the peasants headed by you 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.510
 first name surname likely nothing 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.580
 will say but I should have it sound 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.140
 in the third film it was no longer there since 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 according to the available data they can 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.489
 negotiate with the studio about the salary 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.829
 so here is not only that the actor of the third 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.819
 the film is completely different from so 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.310
 he is even younger than christian by almost 20 years 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.890
 twenty years the story continues 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.629
 the second film but I respected the chronology 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.209
 I do n't remember something like a magic drink 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.220
 even rejuvenate could then have really been 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.829
 so hard to find a similar actor there 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.230
 although got age and in appearance then 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.549
 there is such a mess, even though the screenwriters 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.290
 tried to make his character 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.609
 as close as imbolc 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.680
 dilogii but here's the look and that mustache 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.540
 too much overhead seriously me not 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.700
 left feeling that i'm not looking at 100 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.920
 rice on some cosplay cheek though in 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.720
 the ends of the screenwriter seems to have woken up 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.569
 conscience i'm yours you seem head 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.170
 abs was mistaken so guilty on what 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.200
 stopped 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.629
 and so it seems that the screenwriter such 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.859
 simple and there is no conscience, they are similar in 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.510
 late playfully beat 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:11.870
 it seems worse to be no longer can 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.239
 fourth film and so in the fourth film 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.739
 astrix played the actor who is on 2 movie 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:23.360
 played an assistant number written by the office you 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:26.639
 understand what happened this became this 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.320
 in general it is possible when the same actor in 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.310
 within one universe played two 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.370
 different characters 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.320
 and no labor in the crowd a 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.210
 secondary and then the main thing is not 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.180
 Hilo so bad for the brain recognize me 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.590
 not sickly bombanulo so it can not be broken 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.260
 spatio-temporal cinema 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.660
 continuum want what I crucify 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.970
 here a group of gardens dudes come down 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.010
 Liuli will write a magic drink to the Romans 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.780
 and it's not all about reality 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.539
 would have ended much worse but you 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.030
 understand shiva fractures and the like 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.280
 in inactivity the whole world is filled with references 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.080
 on modern culture is actively here 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.539
 used such weak verbal 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.970
 the designs of which at that time are simply 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.970
 did not exist here is almost all 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.280
 characters are built on the play on words all this 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.139
 created not for us to be servants 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.580
 dismantled every joint and bombed from 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.740
 any inconsistencies 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.780
 These films are designed for entertainment 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.150
 enjoyed not only that 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.250
 madness is happening on the screen but also from 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.240
 from references and parodies that we understand 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.219
 that's cool 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.539
 I personally love these films with 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.250
 pleasure to revise them 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.009
 although I still think that the first of this 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.530
 the movie is the best but itâ€™s only mine 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.750
 personal opinion of your pleasure 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.669
