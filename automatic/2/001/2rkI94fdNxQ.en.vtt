was thinking about doing the Pistons on
the<00:00:27.840> top<00:00:28.050> portion<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.590> keep<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the top portion to keep it you know the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.900 
the top portion to keep it you know the
three<00:00:29.820> wide<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.650> whatever

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
now if you don't include the output for

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.520 
now if you don't include the output for
the<00:00:43.410> bed<00:00:43.710> breaking<00:00:44.129> kneel<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.670> white<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.120> white

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the bed breaking kneel to white to white

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
the bed breaking kneel to white to white
um<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.860> basically<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.340> happened<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.210> did

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
um so basically what happened is I did

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.639 
um so basically what happened is I did
the<00:00:48.539> last<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.379> basically

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the last one and it was basically

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.139 
the last one and it was basically
something<00:00:49.860> along<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.309> lines<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.730> could<00:00:51.030> have

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
something along these lines I could have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
something along these lines I could have
swore<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.719> tried<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:53.219> clearly<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
swore that I tried this but clearly I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
swore that I tried this but clearly I
didn't<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.960> assuming

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
didn't so I think what I was assuming

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
didn't so I think what I was assuming
was<00:00:55.379> gonna<00:00:55.500> happen<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.039> basically<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.030> once

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
was gonna happen was basically this once

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.200 
was gonna happen was basically this once
this<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> pass<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> torch<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.520> this

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
this and pass over the torch that this

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
this and pass over the torch that this
would<00:01:00.420> happen<00:01:00.600> okay<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.250> redstone<00:01:02.640> lamp

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
would happen okay if the redstone lamp

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.899 
would happen okay if the redstone lamp
was<00:01:03.030> directly<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.920> sand<00:01:05.159> block<00:01:05.400> actually

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
was directly on the sand block actually

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.440 
was directly on the sand block actually
not<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> case<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> case<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
not the case not the case so that's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.880 
not the case not the case so that's
pretty<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.350> not<00:01:10.439> gonna<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.740> into

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
pretty much it I'm not gonna go into

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
pretty much it I'm not gonna go into
details<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> whole<00:01:11.909> death<00:01:12.090> counter<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
details on the whole death counter to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
details on the whole death counter to
the<00:01:12.600> whole<00:01:12.720> bed<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.770> spawning

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the whole bed and and all that spawning

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.460 
the whole bed and and all that spawning
stuff<00:01:14.610> I'll<00:01:14.850> reference<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.750> other<00:01:15.960> video<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
stuff I'll reference the other video in

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
stuff I'll reference the other video in
case<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.400> looking<00:01:18.180> for

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
case you're looking at this looking for

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.480 
case you're looking at this looking for
a<00:01:18.420> horizontal<00:01:18.780> death<00:01:19.290> counter<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a horizontal death counter and then it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
a horizontal death counter and then it
kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> lost<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> bed<00:01:21.540> braking<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
kind of lost about the bed braking and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
kind of lost about the bed braking and
all<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.500> I'll<00:01:23.070> reference<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.670> video<00:01:23.909> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
all that I'll reference the video in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.880 
all that I'll reference the video in
which<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.299> explain<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.110> better<00:01:25.590> detail

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
which I explain that in better detail

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
which I explain that in better detail
this<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
this one here is gonna be just the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.789 
this one here is gonna be just the
circuit<00:01:28.500> okay

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
circuit okay

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.590 
circuit okay
so<00:01:29.340> we're<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> through<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> lives<00:01:30.210> each

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so we're going through the lives each

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
so we're going through the lives each
one<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.049> these<00:01:31.140> counsels<00:01:31.680> alive<00:01:31.950> they're<00:01:32.610> all

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
one of these counsels alive they're all

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.679 
one of these counsels alive they're all
breaking<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> hit<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> final<00:01:34.189> life

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
breaking when you hit the final life

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.910 
breaking when you hit the final life
it's<00:01:36.689> gonna<00:01:36.810> pull<00:01:37.049> us<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.500> gravity's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's gonna pull us and up gravity's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200 
it's gonna pull us and up gravity's
gonna<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> fall<00:01:38.520> back<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> then

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
gonna make it fall back down and then

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
gonna make it fall back down and then
the<00:01:39.299> resets<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:40.020> least<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.590> lights<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.250> still

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the resets at least the lights you still

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
the resets at least the lights you still
have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> place<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> sand<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> work

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
have to place the sand for it to work

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.700 
have to place the sand for it to work
okay<00:01:44.600> alright<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.630> we'll<00:01:46.110> build<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.409> one

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
okay alright so we'll build a little one

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
okay alright so we'll build a little one
okay<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.280> two<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> reset

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
okay one two three and then the reset

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.700 
okay one two three and then the reset
here<00:01:49.020> tour<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> torch<00:01:50.070> torch<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.899> we're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
here tour the torch torch and then we're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
here tour the torch torch and then we're
gonna<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.700> let's<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> lamps

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
gonna go up like this let's the lamps

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.459 
gonna go up like this let's the lamps
right<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> final<00:01:56.909> one<00:01:56.939> here

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
right there and then the final one here

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.959 
right there and then the final one here
this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.590> gonna<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> output<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this is gonna be like the output for the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
this is gonna be like the output for the
bed<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.659> what's<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:00.990> gonna<00:02:01.200> make<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
bed and what's actually gonna make the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
bed and what's actually gonna make the
pistons<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.710> basically

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
pistons go up and you know basically

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.419 
pistons go up and you know basically
destroy<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.310> sand<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.429> like

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
destroy the sand all right like so like

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.430 
destroy the sand all right like so like
so<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.540> like<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.599> like

so like so like so like so like
like<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.810> redstone<00:02:15.810> torch<00:02:16.110> dust<00:02:16.980> dust<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> in

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
like so redstone torch dust dust and in

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870 
like so redstone torch dust dust and in
the<00:02:19.380> pistons<00:02:19.740> go<00:02:19.890> right<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.400> line<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.700> this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the pistons go right on line with this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.370 
the pistons go right on line with this
one<00:02:21.090> sticky<00:02:21.480> pistons<00:02:21.870> one<00:02:22.430> two<00:02:24.170> three<00:02:25.170> however

perfect
and<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.540> side<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.870> where<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> sand<00:02:34.380> is

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and on this side is where the sand is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.220 
and on this side is where the sand is
gonna<00:02:34.560> get<00:02:34.800> pushed<00:02:35.070> onto<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:36.230> redstone

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
gonna get pushed onto the redstone

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
much it of course you want to hide it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.510 
much it of course you want to hide it
and<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.750> let's<00:02:52.170> simulate<00:02:52.350> each<00:02:52.770> life<00:02:53.070> okay

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
and then let's simulate each life okay

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.860 
and then let's simulate each life okay
