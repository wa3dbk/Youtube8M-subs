00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello, this is the third part of the textbook 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.270
 I would like to have a builder in this issue 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 tell about the interior 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.460
 This topic is pretty big but I 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 I will try to tell him briefly to everyone 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.670
 start i would like to sleep gidget look 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.369
 what a cool floor I can build myself not 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 here is one of those examples which should not 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 be gender i have said in the first release 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 that combine too many different 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.109
 colors 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.260
 it's not good the floor should be like 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 on color to the walls and to the house in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.570
 overall and of course it will be much better 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.570
 make the floor so just by drawing a line 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.270
 from another cut unit as for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 the ceiling then it can be made from the same 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.300
 blocks as the floor below must be said that the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 the room should not be empty and us 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 just need to install 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.789
 decor elements you just need in the game 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 adaptations and you need to start from the very 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.590
 cumbersome for example from the stairs it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.739
 there are different types they can be made 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.890
 large comfortable or vice versa 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.250
 compact 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.049
 but not very beautiful in my personal 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.049
 I would like to see a house like this 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.689
 here the stairs can also be divided 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 room on the walls can be 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.479
 put the couch sofa mini table 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.070
 tv speakers 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.460
 bar shelves rack and chairs 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 fireplace aquarium and ordinary bathroom poles 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.130
 The room is perfect for such 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 fixtures like sink bathtub faucet 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 toilet shelves well learn Anton for all sorts 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 shampoos scales yes it scales just you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.100
 no fantasy okay go ahead here 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.049
 what can I put in the kitchen fridge 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.479
 oven with stove 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.240
 hood microwave again 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.460
 shell with quran table and chairs in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.850
 bedroom can build a royal 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.490
 bed and decorate it like this 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.250
 a canopy and next to put a straw 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.879
 with diverse and to and in the corner 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.069
 to build a chest is also a bedroom fit 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.950
 here is such a locker 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.689
 it is made of steps half way not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.150
 worth forgetting about the scenery 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:23.209
 already given in the game itself such as 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.760
 picture bookshelves frames and rugs 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.040
 it would also be nice to decorate our house 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.290
 vegetation on a stick to put 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.950
 potted flowers and large corners 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
 plants 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.319
 Let us further light can be quenched 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.989
 for example hang a chandelier 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.439
 other rooms can put in the lamp 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.519
 mounted or stand-up and that's what the result 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.519
 we did it 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.380
 and on this i will probably finish all the luck and 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.550
 bye everyone 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.930

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.930
