00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.260

 and fast with which you just have to 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.660
 give a button to install this mod 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.480
 so let's go to it we have here the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.789
 zip point enrique'd better have the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.550
 description as always download it and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.800
 you leave it on the desk you open it and 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.100
 you have the monex folder next mmo 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.830
 installer we take them out and once 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 is out to preview the folder to which 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.090
 this is one of the ones we have outside 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.120
 we run voucher here we have molex 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.850
 next install and it's as easy as 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.010
 double click on it and it will take a little 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.450
 open up is more than anything because of 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.180
 powerful computer positions just 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.370
 it will take but if you have a pitchfork remove 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.950
 with me then it will take a little 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.809
 so while it opens up then 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.790
 he simply took the opportunity to tell you that 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.200
 leave me in the comments what 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.390
 you want if you want a boat in 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.040
 concrete that helps me a lot because I know 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.909
 that there are some mods that are very 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.219
 popular as 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.679
 for example the king is minimal is not worth the 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.270
 sorry I did a tutorial and found out that 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.090
 it's not worth it because he has done it a lot 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.759
 people or also discover that it's not worth the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.670
 pity on other very famous things because 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.409
 so many people do it that if you do it with 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 many weird like these 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.729

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.459

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.829
 little in which is put instalmat is worth in 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.170
 wait wait, you see, and we have 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.629
 the little button to install and its size 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.270
 mode support explore if you want to donate 

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:50.649
 for the one who has done the mod and who follows 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.829
 doing many and all those rolls worth 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.619
 well we should urge the mod voucher of 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.899
 backup minecraft default install vale 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.299
 say if I want to make a backup 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.359
 a backup before installing 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.219
 what the minecraft is worth we give in my case 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.979
 not because I have the tip minecraft 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.800
 virgin without any other way so you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.250
 we are going to put loading package vale 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.230
 downloading in the mod and the only thing 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.150
 you need is internet connection 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.010
 if you have an internet connection this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.490
 download and I put it at your point 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.110
 minecraft is already well and well 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 simply that you have the point 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.540
 minecraft virgin so you can not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.420
 have no incompatibility because 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.520
 you do not need much more either and 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.010
 this has been all we are going to wait for 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.160
 this is over and well you know this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.290
 mountain of a lot of bombs the is 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.080
 the bomb that is a tunnel boring machine and they do 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.930
 a bomb and square shaped bombs 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.690
 timed nuclear bombs bombs 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.670
 Lava water pumps and fires 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.060
 artificial those are not very cured 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.860
 Well, the truth is that with pimps 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.720
 the nuclear bombs in this mod but 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.020
 that were the host of great if I did not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.120
 I'm wrong but well that does not matter 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.060
 and good different types of pumps like 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.410
 mines that you step on a mine and I can neither 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.080
 they start to rain arrows that's 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.580
 really handsome so this is going to 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.280
 continue to do the root in the network and 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.130
 is advancing worth and with treats of I os 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.860
 I say it and we go back in a minute it's worth it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.200
 Goodbye, it's good, we're back 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.540
 and you see that there puts moore ex proxy mode 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.700
 installer and good and he says he's 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.549
 installed install it worth we give to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.069
 accept and surely you have windows 7 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.110
 or something like that now appears within a few 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.630
 seconds or one minute I'm not sure 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.250
 a window that puts this program 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.750
 could have been installed correctly 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.790
 nothing happens, it's just that 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.690
 issues the slight problem of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.370
 incompatibility 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.900
 the incompatibility does not mean that no 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.000
 go to work that is to say everything 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.240
 perfect but it 's a small flaw that 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.520
 has to what windows it executes as if 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.780
 it was better worth it is a scratched 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.450
 the only important thing that you have to know 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.460
 is that you already have the mod installed and everything 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.260
 goes perfectly so I hope that 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.030
 enjoy this way that you leave me 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.680
