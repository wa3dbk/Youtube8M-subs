extra<00:00:49.359> grain<00:00:49.600> we<00:00:50.499> had<00:00:50.649> no<00:00:50.799> idea<00:00:50.829> how<00:00:51.280> long<00:00:51.429> the

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
extra grain we had no idea how long the

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:52.919 
extra grain we had no idea how long the
geese<00:00:51.789> had<00:00:51.940> actually<00:00:52.179> been<00:00:52.299> in<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.510> field<00:00:52.690> so

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
geese had actually been in the field so

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.239 
geese had actually been in the field so
if<00:00:52.989> they<00:00:53.109> fed<00:00:53.379> up<00:00:53.530> in<00:00:53.679> there<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:53.949> found<00:00:54.100> that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
if they fed up in there and found that

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.629 
if they fed up in there and found that
or<00:00:54.579> if<00:00:55.149> they<00:00:55.269> actually<00:00:55.539> landed<00:00:56.159> but<00:00:57.159> we<00:00:57.399> didn't

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:57.639 
or if they actually landed but we didn't

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.069 
or if they actually landed but we didn't
we<00:00:57.789> didn't<00:00:57.999> really<00:00:58.120> ask<00:00:58.299> why<00:00:58.539> we<00:00:58.749> showed<00:00:58.929> up

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
we didn't really ask why we showed up

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.979
