00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.209

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.490
 expert and we are in a new news and 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:10.650
 the truth is that looming looming 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.870
 war and you know that many times in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 the world of video games so good 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.029
 many statements generate controversy not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 and here in this channel we have always 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.330
 informed of the good from the bad of what 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.519
 regular 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.439
 many times knowing that in the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 comments you are going to kill you are going to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.009
 kill because you're going to throw around 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 many times the truth is that you are 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.090
 I do not like this kind of statements 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.060
 nothing that I am going to discuss a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.060
 Microsoft manager ensures that by 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.720
 good to the more ambitious xbox warnes that 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.300
 playstation 4 so rotund has been in 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.700
 some statements that good has been 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 aaron greenberg executive of microsoft 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.290
 who has talked with the media 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.230
 defending his new console a 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.690
 affirmation so so so so clear 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.060
 regarding the competition in these 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 news that usually generates is that 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.220
 here low in the comments we 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.860
 same 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 uses to kill and I the truth is that 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.970
 I do not like this kind of creation 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.530
 but but you have to inform people 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.870
 because many times you also give 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.150
 account of certain executives or certain 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.480
 people of those companies how are and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.640
 how they defend their interests not anymore 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.520
 one that says no but good, you have to 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 tell it and that's how it has been I 'm not going to aaron 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.320
 greenberg executive of microsoft has 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.510
 chatted today with the media and has 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.000
 assured that the water is more ambitious 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.850
 what playstation 4 in words of 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.250
 grinberg says well I do not think that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.710
 we advanced very soon we had to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.690
 release it next to playstation 4 not 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.630
 we knew what they were doing and 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.700
 they did not know about our things either 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.280
 we were very focused and games like 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 rise or force 5 were in a good 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.620
 moment to be launched to the market 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.960
 when comparing the guard to 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.800
 playstation 4 the executive is not saved 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.690
 none and says we have tried to do more 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 think about kinect in the integration of the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.790
 voice we've been more ambitious I think that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.310
 we are at a good time and we have 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.920
 had a good launch we have not 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.230
 never repented and we have not said 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.330
 that we launched it without being 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 Transnational list loaded with 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.910
 aaron greenberg operations where the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.820
 truth is that I at first sight 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.739
 these statements that of who does not 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.680
 they never repented for example is 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.150
 lie since a few months later 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.739
 they regretted from politics what 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.140
 they threw in the e3 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.200
 said this because it can not affirm either 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.680
 that's not good but there are their 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.170
 statements to me 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.900
 that you discuss that if the one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.760
 it's better than simple 6-4 better always 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.740
 It seems silly I always tell you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.960
 you have to enjoy each one in the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.820
 platform where you can play in the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.380
 that I can get because many times 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.900
 It is very difficult to get a 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.790
 console to play myself I sold all 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.370
 the things I had to be able to get 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.070
 money to buy it and it's difficult is 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.050
 difficult to get a platform one 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.570
 console does not often come out much more 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.840
 profitable to have a mount a pc no 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.360
 I have always said it and the truth is that 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.860
 good that you do not argue that it is not worth 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.800
 it's a pity that each game alone has its 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.390
 its exclusive the web has its games 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.940
 of the playstation when it has its 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.340
 exclusive games the one is going to have its 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.320
 exclusive games and you have to each 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.600
 good according to which platform you have 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.400
 more friends do not have more possibilities 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.610
 to enjoy then that is going to be the best 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.890
 console for you so do not argue that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.960
 it's not worth it that here we are for 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.130
 inform so you know what it is that 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.890
 is cooked in the world of video games 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.750
 and many times as some executives 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.410
 they should be silent that they are much more 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.080
 pretty with 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.340
 do nothing a hug a hug to all the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.210
 favorite team if we see the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.210
 next chau
