but I will show you a trick if you take
some<00:01:41.240> ice<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.979> place<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.430> ice<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:44.719> can

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
some ice and you place the ice you can

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.349 
some ice and you place the ice you can
get<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.200> actual<00:01:45.320> ice<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.979> melt<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.210> will

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
get the actual ice to melt and that will

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.240 
get the actual ice to melt and that will
actually<00:01:47.479> cause<00:01:47.840> water<00:01:48.259> in<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.710> nether<00:01:48.950> so

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
actually cause water in the nether so

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.800 
actually cause water in the nether so
maybe<00:01:49.429> put<00:01:49.609> some<00:01:49.759> torches<00:01:49.969> down<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.539> kind<00:01:50.689> of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
maybe put some torches down to kind of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.550 
maybe put some torches down to kind of
inspire<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:52.789> do<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:53.929> know<00:01:54.109> a<00:01:54.200> lot<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.439> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
inspire to to do but I know a lot of you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.289 
inspire to to do but I know a lot of you
guys<00:01:54.679> were<00:01:54.920> like<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.670> know<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:55.850> might<00:01:56.090> want

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
guys were like you know you might want

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.550 
guys were like you know you might want
to<00:01:56.390> go<00:01:56.479> into<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.840> nether<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.200> build

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
to go into the nether and build

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560 
to go into the nether and build
something<00:01:57.890> cool<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.250> ice<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.329> it<00:01:59.390> really

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
something cool of ice but it really

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.989 
something cool of ice but it really
doesn't<00:01:59.840> give<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.229> option<00:02:00.789> to<00:02:01.789> use

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
doesn't give you that option to use

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.690 
doesn't give you that option to use
water<00:02:02.359> so<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.560> say<00:02:03.770> use<00:02:03.950> ice<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.399> mean<00:02:04.579> to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
water so that I say use ice I mean to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.980 
water so that I say use ice I mean to
use<00:02:04.850> water<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.450> doesn't<00:02:05.719> give<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.869> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
use water but it doesn't give you that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.219 
use water but it doesn't give you that
option<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.409> use<00:02:06.530> water<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.720> might<00:02:08.899> have<00:02:09.020> to

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
option to use water so you might have to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.890 
option to use water so you might have to
you<00:02:10.130> might<00:02:10.250> have<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.490> use<00:02:10.670> ice<00:02:11.000> blocks<00:02:11.390> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
you might have to use ice blocks and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.300 
you might have to use ice blocks and
that's<00:02:12.080> what<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.260> did<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.470> put<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> ice<00:02:12.950> blocks

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
that's what I did I put the ice blocks

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.369 
that's what I did I put the ice blocks
up<00:02:13.519> here<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.900> pretty<00:02:15.140> much<00:02:15.230> just

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
up here and then I pretty much just

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.980 
up here and then I pretty much just
waited<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.510> waited

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
waited for them to like that I waited

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.580 
waited for them to like that I waited
for<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.350> actually<00:02:19.040> become<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> block<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
for it to actually become a block and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.400 
for it to actually become a block and
there<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:21.920> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
there you have it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.530 
there you have it
we<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.710> water<00:02:25.010> in<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> never<00:02:25.610> using<00:02:26.330> ice

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
we now have water in the never using ice

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.480 
we now have water in the never using ice
