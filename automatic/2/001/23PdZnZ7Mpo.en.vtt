00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.500
 hi everyone today we get 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 found for aillleurs love you you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.780
 love me especially inspired by wood but 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.490
 a stylized abstract wood we will say so 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.580
 I started by laying my base a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.539
 opaque brown varnish and a varnish 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 fun a little more transparent 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.720
 but matt then I will use my pen 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.250
 and my brand anchor just neil I 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
 let's start right away with 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.869
 first reason so by the owl but 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 again it's an owl has enough 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 abstract to this sad enough stylized him 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.190
 also so I start with my pen and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 the perfected ink of rome for the eyes 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 you can obviously used the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 acrylic paint if you prefer and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.829
 a brush me it's just to test 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 my pen that I just received and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 then I'll do the little beak so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.420
 between the two eyes I do a little 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.809
 triangle and then I'm going to add a little 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 line in the middle of my triangle 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.489
 then I'll close a little bit 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 head of my owl so let's say 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 I add a little line above 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.390
 eyes and then I'll add the pattern 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.220
 abstract wood pattern but I you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 going on to trets in accelerated because I 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 will show you that on a second 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.840
 angle a little bit more detail so 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.460
 here is the abstract pattern wood pattern I 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 start by making a first curve 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 a first line and then I will add 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 some like that but do not have to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.509
 always do the same curve must do 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.210
 something still enough 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.610
 irregular not always identical to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.009
 regular intervals really need 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 to do something very random and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.000
 then I'm going to add a motive that goes 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.040
 represent a little bit the nodes 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.530
 that can be found in the wood so 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.820
 there I have not reload my pen for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.320
 to have something a little bit more 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 end to have between a little bit more 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 end and I'm not trying to do anything 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.140
 something regular to do some 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 regular rounds again since 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.340
 knots dubois was not necessarily 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.820
 hyper makes so that's it I do not take myself 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.670
 the head 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.159
 on the contrary, I do not dress very well 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 very rome and so I do that several 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.619
 times on my nail at places 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 different 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 I'm only using several colors of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.360
 acrylic paint rather in shades 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.260
 brown and I will start by filling 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.120
 a few words 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.810
 ibou so I start with painting 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 golden acrylic and so I will fill 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.540
 the inside of the malibu beak then I 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.790
 take a second very brown color 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.560
 clear anyway and I'll fill with 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.230
 this color inside the eyes 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.150
 two mummies bout and in fact I'm going 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.459
 take a brown but much more 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 dark this time and I 'm going in 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.870
 add in water and possibly a 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.159
 little bit below my igloo too and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.900
 always with this same marolles I'm going 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.819
 well dilute it this time for 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 it's still very transparent 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.560
 and it's transparent so I'm going 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.780
 add some on my abstract pattern 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.870
 surmotive wood so as you see it 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.220
 I drop it at the level of the curve that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.989
 I had done just now so I 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.099
 drop a few colors and then 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.959
 before it dries before all that 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.970
 dry I will come and shoot the color 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.620
 and that is to degrade it a little bit 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.840
 done it's the same technique as that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 we use for watercolor we put down 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.269
 its color then we wipe a little bit 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.660
 his brush and one degrades all to in 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.639
 write all that we can add the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.230
 color in places by a second 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.449
 color layer in fact if we find 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.190
 that it's not dark enough and like you 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.230
 see I do this on all 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.060
 curves on all races that 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.579
 I had done but that from one side to each 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.030
 time that on the bench in fact the 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.410
 curve and then you can you 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.569
 stop where added a second 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.910
 color a little darker so 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.889
 I added a little bit of black 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.389
 so always on the same principle in 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.609
 trying to degrade slightly the 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.169
 color but this time I I the 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.910
 degrade a lot less I go down 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.639
 much less the color for easter in 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230
 party the black covers Morocco wants that 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.359
 the brown is still present 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.530
 so really I just add a whole 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.599
 little touch of black and then we go 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.329
 iron one last time on our 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.620
 riboud me I'll go back over 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.060
 the eyes that facts just now 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.340
 because I would put a little bit more 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.549
 big a little bit wider than anything to 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.150
 time 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.190
 so I go back over on the eyes on the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.859
 eye contours and I'm going to add 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.630
 then in the center of each eye a 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.850
 little really makes 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.680
 a great classic and then I'm going 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.560
 add as you see little ones 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.570
 traits inside the eye yet 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.150
 once he leaves while I come 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.620
 to do and it will make games 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.840
 really very present but precisely I 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.780
 find it very funny and I go back 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.450
 possibly on the beak too and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.790
 again one last time I go back on 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.170
 the wood pattern and i'm going to add like 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.880
 you see it some small strokes 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.880
 but I do not add them all the way 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.830
 of the curve I choose two or three 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.100
 places where I'm going to just add 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.020
 some small strokes partouche and 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.910
 then for those nail art there I 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.680
 chose to pose top coat maths because 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.380
 that I found the rendering more fun on 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.390
 the wood effect is so for this little 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.310
 mail art rather particular me I have good 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.160
 loved his original side i do not know if 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.900
 it will have pleased you and you can
