00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
just yellow and you would think that it

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.810 
just yellow and you would think that it
smells<00:04:19.780> exactly<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.650> body<00:04:20.950> frosting

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
but it doesn't smell exactly like it so

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.210 
but it doesn't smell exactly like it so
it<00:04:26.110> smells

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
it smells

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.430 
it smells
it<00:04:27.610> smells<00:04:27.970> more<00:04:28.300> fresh<00:04:28.750> but<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.140> really

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
it smells more fresh but I do really
