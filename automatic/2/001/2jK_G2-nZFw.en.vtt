mono tracks to be stereo click OK and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
mono tracks to be stereo click OK and
now<00:00:28.529> you'll<00:00:29.519> notice<00:00:29.789> when<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.240> drag<00:00:30.630> these<00:00:30.929> down

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
now you'll notice when I drag these down

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.590 
now you'll notice when I drag these down
here<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:32.099> come<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.700> stereo<00:00:33.090> left<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
here they come up as stereo left and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
here they come up as stereo left and
right<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.590> leave<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.040> mono<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.760> if

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
right so you can leave it as mono or if

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.819 
right so you can leave it as mono or if
you<00:00:36.000> need<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> match<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.930> another<00:00:37.260> camera

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you need to match it with another camera

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.619 
you need to match it with another camera
or<00:00:38.219> something<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> happens<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
or something like that that happens to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.479 
or something like that that happens to
be<00:00:39.660> stereo<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> go<00:00:41.219> ahead<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
be stereo then you can go ahead and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
be stereo then you can go ahead and
convert<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> stereo<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.780> stores<00:00:43.050> channel

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
convert it to stereo so stores channel

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.540 
convert it to stereo so stores channel
mappings<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.610> handy<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
mappings can be very handy for that

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
mappings can be very handy for that
let's<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.700> ahead<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> add<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> quick<00:00:48.629> title<00:00:49.110> so

this<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.239> now<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> kodak<00:02:15.930> camera<00:02:16.200> shoots<00:02:17.160> in

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
this is now the kodak camera shoots in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250 
this is now the kodak camera shoots in
1080p<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.580> 720p<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.209> it's<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:21.510> multiple

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
1080p and 720p so it's got multiple

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.990 
1080p and 720p so it's got multiple
shooting<00:02:22.709> formats<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.310> again<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.880> to

be critical to know what size preset to
set<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.810> again<00:02:28.110> 720<00:02:28.980> @<00:02:29.420> 2997<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> little

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
set up so again 720 @ 2997 so a little

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.400 
set up so again 720 @ 2997 so a little
bit<00:02:31.560> different<00:02:32.220> than<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.120> had<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:34.290> the
