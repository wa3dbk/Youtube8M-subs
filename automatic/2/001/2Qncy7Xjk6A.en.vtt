00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
you a quick example chests are in here

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.490 
you a quick example chests are in here
okay<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:02.360> basically<00:05:02.539> whenever<00:05:03.139> you<00:05:03.319> put<00:05:03.470> a

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
okay so basically whenever you put a

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.070 
okay so basically whenever you put a
chest<00:05:03.740> down<00:05:03.979> it<00:05:04.699> looks<00:05:04.940> exactly<00:05:05.120> like<00:05:05.479> this

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
chest down it looks exactly like this

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.899 
chest down it looks exactly like this
but<00:05:06.530> when<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.710> put<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.889> double<00:05:07.190> chest<00:05:07.370> down<00:05:07.580> it

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
but when you put a double chest down it

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.059 
but when you put a double chest down it
looks<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.449> top<00:05:08.690> of<00:05:08.900> both<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.440> looks<00:05:09.949> like

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
looks like the top of both it looks like

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.529 
looks like the top of both it looks like
the<00:05:10.159> top<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.490> two<00:05:10.669> single<00:05:11.000> chests<00:05:11.270> together

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
the top of two single chests together

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.960 
the top of two single chests together
what<00:05:12.409> this<00:05:12.830> mod<00:05:13.039> does<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.789> basically

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
what this mod does is it basically

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.629 
what this mod does is it basically
connects<00:05:14.690> them<00:05:14.900> into<00:05:15.259> one<00:05:15.520> solid<00:05:16.520> chest<00:05:16.900> so<00:05:17.900> it

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
connects them into one solid chest so it

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.980 
connects them into one solid chest so it
Mesa<00:05:19.639> collegiate<00:05:20.090> makes<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.389> look<00:05:20.509> better<00:05:20.750> I

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
Mesa collegiate makes it look better I

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.249 
Mesa collegiate makes it look better I
mean<00:05:21.469> it's<00:05:21.770> it's<00:05:22.009> not<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.219> real<00:05:22.430> big<00:05:23.240> thing<00:05:23.930> but

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
mean it's it's not a real big thing but

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.140 
mean it's it's not a real big thing but
it<00:05:24.409> you<00:05:24.979> know<00:05:25.099> anyway

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
it you know anyway

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.820 
it you know anyway
connection<00:05:26.719> mod<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:27.139> as<00:05:27.289> you<00:05:27.409> can<00:05:27.560> see<00:05:27.710> with

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
connection mod is as you can see with

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.390 
connection mod is as you can see with
this<00:05:27.979> specific<00:05:28.940> sandstone<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:30.800> has<00:05:31.069> the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
this specific sandstone it has the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.370 
this specific sandstone it has the
sensitive<00:05:31.849> texture<00:05:32.240> on<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.630> sides<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.259> then

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
sensitive texture on the sides and then

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.499 
sensitive texture on the sides and then
the<00:05:33.590> flat<00:05:33.889> piece<00:05:34.099> on<00:05:34.250> top<00:05:34.460> which<00:05:35.120> starts<00:05:35.449> to

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
the flat piece on top which starts to

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.580 
the flat piece on top which starts to
look<00:05:35.630> really<00:05:35.900> weird<00:05:36.110> if<00:05:36.259> you<00:05:36.289> have<00:05:36.440> like<00:05:36.560> a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
look really weird if you have like a

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.350 
look really weird if you have like a
wall<00:05:36.830> of<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:37.099> what<00:05:37.280> this<00:05:37.400> does<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:38.000> when<00:05:38.270> you

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
wall of it what this does is when you

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.450 
wall of it what this does is when you
place<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:39.110> makes<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.770> all<00:05:39.979> one<00:05:40.190> solid

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
place it it makes it all one solid

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.670 
place it it makes it all one solid
texture<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.659> it<00:05:41.780> gets<00:05:41.930> rid<00:05:42.080> of<00:05:42.139> the<00:05:42.199> things<00:05:42.530> on

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
texture so it gets rid of the things on

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.740 
texture so it gets rid of the things on
top<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.190> kind<00:05:43.639> of<00:05:43.669> just<00:05:43.819> you<00:05:44.000> know<00:05:44.120> does<00:05:44.599> that

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
top and kind of just you know does that

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.740 
top and kind of just you know does that
it's<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.620> really<00:05:45.889> simple<00:05:46.340> change<00:05:46.759> but<00:05:47.060> much

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
it's a really simple change but much

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.519 
it's a really simple change but much
much<00:05:48.139> better

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
much better

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.320 
much better
alright<00:05:49.430> umm<00:05:49.699> let's<00:05:50.539> see<00:05:51.759> well<00:05:52.759> let's<00:05:52.909> go<00:05:53.180> to

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
alright umm let's see well let's go to

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.399 
alright umm let's see well let's go to
the<00:05:53.449> surface<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:54.400> show<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.460> a<00:05:56.000> more<00:05:56.419> or<00:05:56.779> less

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
the surface and show you a more or less

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.339 
the surface and show you a more or less
confined<00:05:57.889> space<00:05:58.630> this<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.779> the<00:05:59.900> test<00:06:00.110> rolled

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
confined space this is the test rolled

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.159 
confined space this is the test rolled
flat<00:06:00.560> perfect<00:06:01.069> for<00:06:01.219> testing<00:06:01.819> everything<00:06:02.270> but

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
flat perfect for testing everything but

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.709 
flat perfect for testing everything but
um<00:06:03.349> I<00:06:03.680> believe<00:06:04.340> it<00:06:04.639> also<00:06:04.819> adds<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.449> bottom

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
um I believe it also adds a bottom

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.510 
um I believe it also adds a bottom
texture<00:06:06.110> so<00:06:06.349> let's<00:06:06.560> see<00:06:06.770> well<00:06:07.099> let's<00:06:07.370> go<00:06:07.490> ahead

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
texture so let's see well let's go ahead

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.120 
texture so let's see well let's go ahead
and<00:06:07.699> show<00:06:07.819> you<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.330> glass<00:06:08.569> texture<00:06:09.080> as<00:06:09.949> you

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
and show you the glass texture as you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.830 
and show you the glass texture as you
can<00:06:10.279> see<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.610> a<00:06:10.699> single<00:06:10.969> glass<00:06:11.180> texture<00:06:11.659> but

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
can see it's a single glass texture but

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.510 
can see it's a single glass texture but
when<00:06:11.870> you<00:06:11.990> place<00:06:12.199> another<00:06:12.349> one<00:06:12.529> it<00:06:13.190> gets<00:06:13.310> rid

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
when you place another one it gets rid

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.120 
when you place another one it gets rid
of<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.669> edge<00:06:13.849> there<00:06:14.210> and<00:06:14.449> mix<00:06:14.599> into<00:06:15.020> one<00:06:15.380> big

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
of the edge there and mix into one big

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.159 
of the edge there and mix into one big
solid<00:06:16.610> piece<00:06:16.819> so<00:06:17.449> you<00:06:17.509> don't<00:06:17.659> have<00:06:17.779> all<00:06:18.020> those

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
solid piece so you don't have all those

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.480 
solid piece so you don't have all those
lines<00:06:18.469> in<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.770> middle<00:06:18.979> of<00:06:19.039> your<00:06:19.130> glass<00:06:19.340> and

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
lines in the middle of your glass and

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.129 
lines in the middle of your glass and
you<00:06:19.550> can<00:06:19.699> actually<00:06:19.819> see<00:06:20.150> through<00:06:20.360> it<00:06:20.479> and<00:06:20.870> of

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
you can actually see through it and of

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.809 
you can actually see through it and of
course<00:06:21.199> with<00:06:21.500> different<00:06:21.889> mods<00:06:22.190> and<00:06:22.520> different

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
course with different mods and different

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.459 
course with different mods and different
textures<00:06:23.090> well<00:06:23.569> different<00:06:23.870> textures<00:06:24.229> I'm<00:06:24.349> in

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
textures well different textures I'm in

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.830 
textures well different textures I'm in
four<00:06:25.400> different<00:06:25.490> packs<00:06:25.819> of<00:06:26.120> course<00:06:26.539> the<00:06:26.659> glass

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
four different packs of course the glass

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.330 
four different packs of course the glass
looks<00:06:27.050> different<00:06:27.380> but<00:06:27.529> the<00:06:27.889> same<00:06:28.039> basic

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
looks different but the same basic

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.680 
looks different but the same basic
principle<00:06:28.460> is<00:06:28.819> it<00:06:28.909> all<00:06:29.060> connects<00:06:29.419> together

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
principle is it all connects together

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.980 
principle is it all connects together
and<00:06:30.400> forms<00:06:31.400> into<00:06:31.610> one<00:06:31.789> big<00:06:32.060> piece<00:06:32.270> of<00:06:32.330> glass<00:06:32.479> no

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
and forms into one big piece of glass no

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.740 
and forms into one big piece of glass no
matter<00:06:33.169> how<00:06:34.069> you<00:06:34.130> shape<00:06:34.460> it<00:06:34.610> which<00:06:34.880> is<00:06:35.060> really

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
matter how you shape it which is really

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.829 
matter how you shape it which is really
really<00:06:36.139> worth<00:06:36.440> getting<00:06:36.649> just<00:06:37.009> for<00:06:37.159> the<00:06:37.219> glass

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:37.839 
really worth getting just for the glass

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.159 
really worth getting just for the glass
another<00:06:38.839> cool<00:06:39.050> part<00:06:39.349> about<00:06:39.469> this<00:06:39.740> texture

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
another cool part about this texture

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.409 
another cool part about this texture
hmm<00:06:42.169> I'm<00:06:42.619> not<00:06:42.769> sure<00:06:42.949> if<00:06:43.039> that<00:06:43.419> part

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
hmm I'm not sure if that part

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:46.059 
hmm I'm not sure if that part
specifically<00:06:44.959> is<00:06:45.139> working<00:06:45.559> but<00:06:45.709> I<00:06:45.739> think<00:06:45.949> it's

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069 
specifically is working but I think it's

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.649 
specifically is working but I think it's
supposed<00:06:46.279> to<00:06:46.339> give<00:06:46.519> a<00:06:46.729> bottom<00:06:47.119> to<00:06:47.269> the<00:06:47.360> chest

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
supposed to give a bottom to the chest

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.119 
supposed to give a bottom to the chest
so<00:06:47.899> it<00:06:47.989> doesn't<00:06:48.229> look<00:06:48.319> like<00:06:48.499> the<00:06:48.619> top<00:06:48.829> of<00:06:48.979> them

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
so it doesn't look like the top of them

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.669 
so it doesn't look like the top of them
which<00:06:49.789> looks<00:06:49.999> really<00:06:50.149> weird<00:06:50.449> with<00:06:51.289> certain

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:51.679 
which looks really weird with certain

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:55.149 
which looks really weird with certain
packs<00:06:52.629> apparently<00:06:53.679> either<00:06:54.679> I<00:06:54.829> don't<00:06:54.949> know<00:06:55.069> how

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
packs apparently either I don't know how

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.039 
packs apparently either I don't know how
to<00:06:55.249> get<00:06:55.339> it<00:06:55.429> to<00:06:55.489> work<00:06:55.699> or<00:06:55.969> it's<00:06:56.839> not

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:57.049 
to get it to work or it's not

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.869 
to get it to work or it's not
implemented<00:06:57.439> yet<00:06:57.739> but<00:06:58.429> let's<00:06:58.610> go<00:06:58.729> ahead<00:06:58.759> with

00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 
implemented yet but let's go ahead with

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.539 
implemented yet but let's go ahead with
the<00:06:59.089> bookshelves<00:06:59.269> now<00:07:00.069> as<00:07:01.069> you<00:07:01.309> place<00:07:01.519> a

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:01.549 
the bookshelves now as you place a

00:07:01.549 --> 00:07:03.819 
the bookshelves now as you place a
bookshelf<00:07:01.999> you<00:07:02.719> can<00:07:02.869> see<00:07:03.049> it's<00:07:03.199> kind<00:07:03.409> of<00:07:03.529> you

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:03.829 
bookshelf you can see it's kind of you

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:05.289 
bookshelf you can see it's kind of you
know<00:07:03.919> kind<00:07:04.429> of<00:07:04.519> the<00:07:04.610> same<00:07:04.789> than<00:07:04.969> when<00:07:05.089> you<00:07:05.149> put

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:05.299 
know kind of the same than when you put

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.669 
know kind of the same than when you put
it<00:07:05.360> together<00:07:05.509> just<00:07:05.719> looks<00:07:06.079> like<00:07:06.229> three

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:06.679 
it together just looks like three

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:08.649 
it together just looks like three
bookshelves<00:07:07.099> together<00:07:07.399> but<00:07:08.360> when<00:07:08.449> you<00:07:08.539> do

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
bookshelves together but when you do

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.829 
bookshelves together but when you do
this<00:07:08.839> it<00:07:09.199> looks<00:07:09.679> like<00:07:09.949> one<00:07:10.459> big<00:07:10.669> bookshelf<00:07:11.119> and

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839 
this it looks like one big bookshelf and

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.359 
this it looks like one big bookshelf and
the<00:07:12.019> cool<00:07:12.169> thing<00:07:12.319> is<00:07:12.349> I<00:07:12.499> think<00:07:12.739> it<00:07:13.009> keeps<00:07:13.189> going

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:13.369 
the cool thing is I think it keeps going

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.869 
the cool thing is I think it keeps going
on<00:07:13.610> as<00:07:13.969> long<00:07:14.029> as<00:07:14.209> you<00:07:14.360> put<00:07:14.599> things<00:07:14.929> next<00:07:15.199> to<00:07:15.319> it

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
on as long as you put things next to it

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.009 
on as long as you put things next to it
of<00:07:16.879> course<00:07:17.029> it<00:07:17.239> doesn't<00:07:17.360> work<00:07:17.539> with<00:07:17.689> snacking

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:18.019 
of course it doesn't work with snacking

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:19.239 
of course it doesn't work with snacking
on<00:07:18.079> top<00:07:18.319> it<00:07:18.469> looks<00:07:18.559> like<00:07:18.769> a<00:07:18.799> completely

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.249 
on top it looks like a completely

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:21.999 
on top it looks like a completely
different<00:07:19.369> row<00:07:19.879> but<00:07:20.599> but<00:07:21.499> when<00:07:21.649> you<00:07:21.739> look<00:07:21.889> at

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:22.009 
different row but but when you look at

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.609 
different row but but when you look at
it<00:07:22.099> like<00:07:22.219> this<00:07:22.779> it<00:07:23.779> looks<00:07:23.959> like<00:07:24.110> one<00:07:24.349> big

00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:24.619 
it like this it looks like one big

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:26.559 
it like this it looks like one big
flowing<00:07:25.009> bookshelf<00:07:25.429> and<00:07:25.819> of<00:07:26.119> course<00:07:26.329> you<00:07:26.419> can

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:26.569 
flowing bookshelf and of course you can

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.479 
flowing bookshelf and of course you can
again<00:07:26.989> edit<00:07:27.229> the<00:07:27.529> textures<00:07:27.949> to<00:07:28.129> make<00:07:28.249> it<00:07:28.339> look

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:28.489 
again edit the textures to make it look

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:29.829 
again edit the textures to make it look
more<00:07:28.759> flowing<00:07:29.239> so<00:07:29.419> it<00:07:29.509> doesn't<00:07:29.719> look<00:07:29.809> like

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:29.839 
more flowing so it doesn't look like

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.769 
more flowing so it doesn't look like
just<00:07:30.399> three<00:07:31.399> of<00:07:31.459> the<00:07:31.579> same<00:07:31.699> texture<00:07:32.149> paste<00:07:32.569> it

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:32.779 
just three of the same texture paste it

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.819 
just three of the same texture paste it
together<00:07:33.579> but<00:07:34.579> you<00:07:35.389> get<00:07:35.749> the<00:07:35.839> basic<00:07:36.139> idea<00:07:36.259> it's

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:36.829 
together but you get the basic idea it's

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:39.039 
together but you get the basic idea it's
a<00:07:36.919> really<00:07:37.279> neat<00:07:37.519> really<00:07:37.879> simple<00:07:38.419> mod<00:07:38.599> that

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:39.049 
a really neat really simple mod that

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:41.109 
a really neat really simple mod that
adds<00:07:39.079> so<00:07:39.589> much<00:07:39.679> more<00:07:39.919> to<00:07:40.069> the<00:07:40.189> game<00:07:40.369> to<00:07:40.879> make<00:07:40.999> it

00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:41.119 
adds so much more to the game to make it

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.759 
adds so much more to the game to make it
look<00:07:41.360> better<00:07:41.539> it<00:07:42.019> doesn't<00:07:42.349> add<00:07:42.469> things

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:42.769 
look better it doesn't add things

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:45.219 
look better it doesn't add things
mechanical<00:07:43.610> but<00:07:44.299> it<00:07:44.389> does<00:07:44.539> look<00:07:44.719> really<00:07:44.959> good

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:45.229 
mechanical but it does look really good

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:47.589 
mechanical but it does look really good
the<00:07:45.769> cool<00:07:45.979> thing<00:07:46.159> about<00:07:46.279> this<00:07:46.519> specific<00:07:47.419> mod

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 
the cool thing about this specific mod

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:50.399 
the cool thing about this specific mod
is<00:07:48.050> since<00:07:48.259> it's<00:07:48.409> all<00:07:48.529> graphical<00:07:49.129> all<00:07:49.489> you<00:07:49.909> know

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:50.409 
is since it's all graphical all you know

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:53.319 
is since it's all graphical all you know
client-side<00:07:51.409> is<00:07:51.769> it<00:07:52.189> works<00:07:52.399> on<00:07:52.579> SPS<00:07:53.059> as<00:07:53.179> well

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:53.329 
client-side is it works on SPS as well

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.269 
client-side is it works on SPS as well
so<00:07:53.869> you<00:07:53.959> can<00:07:54.110> download<00:07:54.229> this<00:07:54.559> and<00:07:54.769> have<00:07:54.919> the

00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:55.279 
so you can download this and have the

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.429 
so you can download this and have the
beauty<00:07:55.729> and<00:07:56.029> even<00:07:56.539> your<00:07:56.719> SP<00:07:57.939> worlds<00:07:58.939> I<00:07:59.089> guess

00:07:59.429 --> 00:07:59.439 
beauty and even your SP worlds I guess

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:01.299 
beauty and even your SP worlds I guess
but<00:08:00.439> that's<00:08:00.559> going<00:08:00.829> to<00:08:00.889> be<00:08:00.949> it<00:08:01.099> for<00:08:01.249> this

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:01.309 
but that's going to be it for this

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:02.979 
but that's going to be it for this
