on to the yellow iPod connector and then

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.550 
on to the yellow iPod connector and then
the<00:01:46.649> ipod<00:01:47.009> connector<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.930> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.200> into

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the ipod connector is going to go into

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
the ipod connector is going to go into
the<00:01:50.549> sony<00:01:50.790> remote<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.820> soldering<00:01:54.540> we're

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the sony remote and the soldering we're

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
the sony remote and the soldering we're
going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> doing<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.189> solder<00:01:56.399> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
going to be doing here is we solder this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
going to be doing here is we solder this
to<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:58.170> our<00:01:58.950> microphone<00:02:02.030> will<00:02:03.030> go

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to this and then our microphone will go

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
to this and then our microphone will go
right<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.070> ultimately<00:02:05.329> when<00:02:06.329> i<00:02:06.390> got

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
right in here and ultimately when i got

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
right in here and ultimately when i got
another<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> spare<00:02:07.229> we'll<00:02:07.680> probably<00:02:07.860> just

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
another one to spare we'll probably just

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.750 
another one to spare we'll probably just
bypass<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> whole<00:02:09.030> ipod<00:02:10.400> cable<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.640> go

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
bypass the whole ipod cable and go

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
bypass the whole ipod cable and go
directly<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.870> microphone<00:02:13.410> into

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
directly to the microphone into

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.520 
directly to the microphone into
the<00:02:14.900> remote<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.170> nice<00:02:16.320> thing<00:02:16.350> about

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the remote and the nice thing about

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
the remote and the nice thing about
using<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.040> remote<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.820> actually<00:02:17.850> do

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
using the remote is you can actually do

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.500 
using the remote is you can actually do
recording<00:02:19.410> whether<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> can<00:02:19.830> pause<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
recording whether you can pause the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.140 
recording whether you can pause the
recording<00:02:21.920> restart<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.040> playback<00:02:23.460> use

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
recording restart it playback use

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.210 
recording restart it playback use
another<00:02:24.420> adapter<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> audio<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
another adapter to get the audio out of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
another adapter to get the audio out of
this<00:02:26.730> ipod<00:02:27.150> cable<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.990> monitor<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
this ipod cable so we can monitor the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.850 
this ipod cable so we can monitor the
audio<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.800> we're<00:02:29.040> recording<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.580> way

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
audio that we're recording that way

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.470 
audio that we're recording that way
we'll<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.100> more<00:02:32.370> advanced<00:02:32.820> tack<00:02:33.000> later<00:02:33.270> on

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
we'll have a more advanced tack later on

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.910 
we'll have a more advanced tack later on
how<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.720> actually<00:02:33.930> hook<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
how to actually hook this all up with a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.560 
how to actually hook this all up with a
headset<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.460> make<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.730> smaller<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.390> or

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
headset and make it a smaller little or

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.470 
headset and make it a smaller little or
cable<00:02:37.220> all<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.400> right<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.850> pox<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
cable all right right now pox is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.120 
cable all right right now pox is
desoldering<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.410> end<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> cable<00:02:41.690> also

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
desoldering the end of the cable also

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.670 
desoldering the end of the cable also
the<00:02:44.130> mic<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.610> have<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> powered<00:02:45.330> mike

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the mic that we have is a powered mike

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.080 
the mic that we have is a powered mike
so<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> battery<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.940> when

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
so you have to have a battery in it when

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.890 
so you have to have a battery in it when
you're<00:02:48.210> running<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.260> batteries<00:02:49.710> last<00:02:49.950> like

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
you're running the batteries last like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.870 
you're running the batteries last like
hundreds<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> hours<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.670> not<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.820> huge

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
hundreds of hours so it's not a huge

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960 
hundreds of hours so it's not a huge
concern<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:55.530> our<00:02:55.890> test<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.459> system<00:02:56.760> worked

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
concern in our test the system worked

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.210 
concern in our test the system worked
with<00:02:57.209> normal<00:02:58.020> unpowered<00:02:58.410> microphones<00:02:59.040> as

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
with normal unpowered microphones as

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.590 
with normal unpowered microphones as
well<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:00.209> mileage<00:03:00.330> may<00:03:00.540> vary<00:03:02.570> there's<00:03:03.570> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
well but your mileage may vary there's a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.030 
well but your mileage may vary there's a
few<00:03:03.810> pieces<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.350> need<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> feed<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.830> here

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
few pieces that we need to feed on here

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.090 
few pieces that we need to feed on here
first<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:06.650> reassemble<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:07.980> make<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
first to reassemble this and make it

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.970 
first to reassemble this and make it
look<00:03:08.280> seamless<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:10.350> nice<00:03:10.530> thing<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:10.770> this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
look seamless the nice thing about this

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.680 
look seamless the nice thing about this
whole<00:03:11.160> process<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.000> even<00:03:12.510> need

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
whole process of you and you even need

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.699 
whole process of you and you even need
any<00:03:12.840> shrink<00:03:13.230> wrap<00:03:15.080> alright<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.290> got<00:03:16.320> trim

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
any shrink wrap alright so we got trim

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.509 
any shrink wrap alright so we got trim
these<00:03:16.860> up<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.130> little<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.520> because<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.850> were

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
these up a little here because we were

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.070 
these up a little here because we were
cables<00:03:20.519> are<00:03:20.640> too<00:03:20.760> long<00:03:20.940> they'll<00:03:21.690> hit<00:03:22.050> each

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
cables are too long they'll hit each

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.650 
cables are too long they'll hit each
other<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.650> create<00:03:22.890> short<00:03:23.160> circuit<00:03:26.540> make<00:03:27.540> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
other and create short circuit make it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.150 
other and create short circuit make it
either<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.170> can<00:03:28.290> either<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.800> where<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
either you can either do this where you

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.009 
either you can either do this where you
just<00:03:29.310> wrap<00:03:29.489> electrical<00:03:30.330> tape<00:03:30.600> around<00:03:30.810> my

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
just wrap electrical tape around my

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.940 
just wrap electrical tape around my
shrink<00:03:31.380> wrap<00:03:31.590> them<00:03:33.950> we're<00:03:34.950> lazy<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.950> alright

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
shrink wrap them we're lazy so alright

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.470 
shrink wrap them we're lazy so alright
so<00:03:38.130> what<00:03:38.250> we're<00:03:38.340> doing<00:03:38.550> right<00:03:38.640> now<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.300> cut

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so what we're doing right now is we cut

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080 
so what we're doing right now is we cut
back<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.989> ends<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.430> cleaning<00:03:41.640> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
back the ends and we are cleaning the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.820 
back the ends and we are cleaning the
wire<00:03:42.420> tips<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:47.810> pinning<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.930> makes<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.590> lot

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
wire tips and pinning it makes it a lot

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.009 
wire tips and pinning it makes it a lot
easier<00:03:49.890> we're<00:03:50.640> using<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:51.060> resin<00:03:51.480> core<00:03:51.720> solder

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
easier we're using a resin core solder

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.350 
easier we're using a resin core solder
and<00:03:52.410> that's<00:03:52.920> got<00:03:53.250> some<00:03:53.459> flux<00:03:53.730> built<00:03:54.000> into<00:03:54.239> it

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and that's got some flux built into it

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.259 
and that's got some flux built into it
so<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.540> don't<00:03:54.600> have<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.959> mess<00:03:55.470> around<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> flux

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.330 

and<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> very<00:04:01.200> fine<00:04:01.560> soldering<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and this is a very fine soldering so

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.009 
and this is a very fine soldering so
it's<00:04:02.519> it's<00:04:02.970> pretty<00:04:03.209> simple<00:04:03.450> pretty

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
it's it's pretty simple pretty

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.509 
it's it's pretty simple pretty
straightforward<00:04:04.170> stuff<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:07.280> we<00:04:08.280> are<00:04:08.400> going

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
straightforward stuff and we are going

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.890 
straightforward stuff and we are going
to<00:04:08.580> solder<00:04:10.220> they<00:04:11.220> consider<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.760> hot<00:04:11.940> wire<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
to solder they consider the hot wire the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.780 
to solder they consider the hot wire the
center<00:04:13.230> one<00:04:13.410> that's<00:04:13.590> actually<00:04:14.220> conducting

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
center one that's actually conducting

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.039 
center one that's actually conducting
the<00:04:14.940> information<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.739> 22<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.370> 22<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.570> number

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
the information on 22 on 22 and number

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.150 
the information on 22 on 22 and number
two<00:04:19.200> on<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.380> XLR<00:04:19.739> jack

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.910 

ok<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:23.940> then<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.180> pretty<00:04:24.390> simple<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:25.020> then

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
ok and then it's pretty simple and then

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.910 
ok and then it's pretty simple and then
we<00:04:26.220> got<00:04:26.370> our<00:04:26.460> little<00:04:26.490> ground<00:04:26.880> wire<00:04:27.680> which<00:04:28.680> goes

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
we got our little ground wire which goes

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:37.660 
we got our little ground wire which goes
on<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.400> three<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:31.800> bring<00:04:32.040> your<00:04:32.160> fingers<00:04:32.430> are

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.470 

cut<00:04:38.670> off<00:04:39.140> just<00:04:40.140> like<00:04:40.320> said<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:42.240> wanna<00:04:42.390> make

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
cut off just like said you wanna make

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.940 
cut off just like said you wanna make
sure<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.660> none<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.140> these<00:04:43.350> wires<00:04:43.710> are

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
sure that none of these wires are

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.530 
sure that none of these wires are
touching<00:04:44.400> any<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.700> exposed<00:04:45.060> wire<00:04:45.270> from

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
touching any of the exposed wire from

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.960 
touching any of the exposed wire from
the<00:04:45.600> ground<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:47.270> pin<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.390> there<00:04:49.970> alright

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
the ground to the pin to there alright

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.170 
the ground to the pin to there alright
so<00:04:51.740> if<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.920> got<00:04:53.040> everything<00:04:53.250> soldered<00:04:53.700> just

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
so if you got everything soldered just

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.630 
so if you got everything soldered just
got<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> thread<00:04:55.170> on<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.620> old<00:04:55.860> components<00:04:56.550> that

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
got a thread on the old components that

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.010 
got a thread on the old components that
we<00:04:56.730> took<00:04:56.880> off<00:04:59.480> line<00:05:00.480> everything<00:05:00.810> up<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:03.750> push

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
we took off line everything up and push

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.700 
we took off line everything up and push
it<00:05:04.170> through<00:05:06.950> fairly<00:05:07.950> straightforward<00:05:09.710> maybe

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
it through fairly straightforward maybe

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:21.650 
it through fairly straightforward maybe
a<00:05:10.800> little<00:05:10.830> too<00:05:11.040> straightforward

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.410 

voila<00:05:22.290> no<00:05:23.280> shrink<00:05:23.550> wrap<00:05:23.730> or<00:05:23.850> anything<00:05:24.180> and

voila no shrink wrap or anything and

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.620 
voila no shrink wrap or anything and

just<00:06:13.440> hit<00:06:13.590> plus<00:06:14.310> and<00:06:14.610> then<00:06:15.390> press<00:06:16.380> play<00:06:16.410> and

probably hear this in an audio podcast

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.600 
probably hear this in an audio podcast
before<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:22.050> video<00:06:22.170> podcast<00:06:22.830> but<00:06:23.190> this<00:06:23.310> is<00:06:23.490> one

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
before the video podcast but this is one

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.540 
before the video podcast but this is one
of<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:23.760> first<00:06:23.910> tests<00:06:24.840> right<00:06:25.140> now<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:26.220> see<00:06:26.250> if

of the first tests right now to see if
the<00:06:27.890> connection<00:06:28.890> that<00:06:28.920> we<00:06:29.250> soldered<00:06:29.760> together

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
the connection that we soldered together

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.930 
the connection that we soldered together
works<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.920> stop<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:32.130> you<00:06:32.280> can<00:06:32.430> just<00:06:32.460> go<00:06:32.880> ahead

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
works and stop it you can just go ahead

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.020 
works and stop it you can just go ahead
and<00:06:33.090> hit<00:06:33.470> pause<00:06:34.470> and<00:06:36.950> then<00:06:37.950> you<00:06:38.100> can<00:06:38.250> hit<00:06:38.370> minus

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
and hit pause and then you can hit minus

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.900
