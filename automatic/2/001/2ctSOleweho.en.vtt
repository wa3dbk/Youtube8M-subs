00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.330 
wearing the jacket over a lot of layers
or<00:01:30.080> simply<00:01:30.470> prefer<00:01:30.740> something<00:01:31.010> that's<00:01:31.250> a

or simply prefer something that's a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.090 
or simply prefer something that's a
little<00:01:31.460> bit<00:01:31.640> more<00:01:31.880> generously<00:01:32.450> sized<00:01:32.920> but<00:01:33.920> the

little bit more generously sized but the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.620 
little bit more generously sized but the
important<00:01:34.550> thing<00:01:34.790> though<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:35.120> we've<00:01:35.270> still

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
important thing though is we've still

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.510 
important thing though is we've still
not<00:01:35.810> got<00:01:36.050> lots<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.409> excess<00:01:36.770> fabric<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:37.400> it's

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
not got lots of excess fabric so it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.950 
not got lots of excess fabric so it's
going<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.729> work<00:01:37.880> well<00:01:38.120> with<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.300> harness<00:01:38.600> and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
going to work well with a harness and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.570 
going to work well with a harness and
it's<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.500> be<00:01:39.560> completely<00:01:40.100> unrestricted

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
it's going to be completely unrestricted

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.820 
it's going to be completely unrestricted
whether<00:01:41.030> you're<00:01:41.210> skiing<00:01:41.390> steep<00:01:41.900> lines<00:01:42.260> or

indeed<00:01:43.190> climbing<00:01:43.640> hard<00:01:43.880> routes<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:45.380> also

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
indeed climbing hard routes it's also

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.290 
indeed climbing hard routes it's also
got<00:01:45.890> great<00:01:46.130> arm<00:01:46.490> lifts<00:01:46.790> as<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.090> would<00:01:47.210> expect

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
got great arm lifts as you would expect

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.750 
got great arm lifts as you would expect
it's<00:01:48.260> got<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.470> slightly<00:01:48.890> longer<00:01:49.190> length<00:01:49.549> as

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's got a slightly longer length as

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.039 
it's got a slightly longer length as
well<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:50.270> going<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.450> give<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:50.659> excellent

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049
