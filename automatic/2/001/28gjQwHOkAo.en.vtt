00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.700
 so friends greetings she sent 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.789
 another exhibition and I have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.090
 you believe me then one is the mdm 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 az 1 mar brought with her small 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.260
 centipede so only six axa yes yes 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.870
 exactly 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 write to us now a little bit of 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.510
 so rather fresh back of the eck but 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.470
 wallpaper itself really well 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 now he has a load maybe we would have 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:50.070
 so we make loading area loading area 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 could make it what that too 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.549
 different again 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.559
 It may be, for example 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.350
 he still had it on me but 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.430
 for example, the day before petacchis not the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.430
 day from the back may 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.760
 how long is it no longer wondering 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 these points off 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.310
 here are the fuel can on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 ten liters drink second repair two 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.010
 workshop points of the program that is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.010
 but really awesome 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.970
 we can have a few now can 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.810
 we first off 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.810
 third 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.470
 Wood 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 march wants that's all a bit 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.260
 counts so what do I think but that can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 also wear 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.110
 I would not have to do that yet 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.380
 he has definitely played another role 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 stretched reader 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.180
 O 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.180
 and big wheels 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.719
 that looks great 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.159
 that's how it has to be, what often happens now 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:36.159
 it only takes 600 liters of tank or more 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:38.079
 He brings 800 800 points with us 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:44.170
 Now it has always put that down 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:50.250
 the day after, who ever we looked 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 Here are a river crossing room 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.090
 There crossed the river 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 there 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.260
 that's good the motives 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.260
 endangers but it is an ultimate 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.710
 age is the world 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.010
 I 'd rather have the hat now 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.010
 his 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.920
 that's the speed coming and going 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.920
 he is of course awesome 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 has now 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.610
 now is just getting up now 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.610
 comes already 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.010
 yes hello 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 because it's off again 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.500
 you realize you're a heavy one but so 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.040
 really interested and in the stones 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.040
 so 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.510
 that's not really behind that 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.010
 wonderful schirmer emperor and eke would be it 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.400
 that is two axes between the 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.400
 accuracy 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.019
 yes, download links would be logical like 

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:25.019
 always with me in the description 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.560
 if you otherwise is something for me to 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:40.160
 I need to go down again 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.160
 far too far 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.820
 again far too far now 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.210
 the car grows i have that now 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.210
 car changed 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.220
 I do not enjoy it much now 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.100
 have moved do it with water then 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.290
 also in a separate video 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.670
 we saw that exactly monstertruck yes 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.470
 and if he takes screenshots to something 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.510
 in the forum we post on facebook 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.250
 just once we sent what course 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.250
 So friends too, so far beautiful
