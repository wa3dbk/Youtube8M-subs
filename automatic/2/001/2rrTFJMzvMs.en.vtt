00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.190 
big tire lock up so I flat spotted both
front<00:04:18.530> tires<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.610> I<00:04:20.090> basically<00:04:20.420> just<00:04:20.750> cruised

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
front tires so I basically just cruised

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.560 
front tires so I basically just cruised
around<00:04:21.410> for<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:21.890> rest<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:23.090> race<00:04:23.270> I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
around for the rest of the the race I

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.810 
around for the rest of the the race I
think<00:04:24.320> fourth<00:04:24.590> fifth<00:04:24.920> place<00:04:25.310> or<00:04:25.610> something

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
think fourth fifth place or something

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.090 
think fourth fifth place or something
like<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.480> I<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.470> enjoyed<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.920> view

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
like that and I just enjoyed the view

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.290 
like that and I just enjoyed the view
there<00:04:28.250> wasn't<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> lot<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.700> could<00:04:28.850> do<00:04:29.030> with<00:04:29.060> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
there wasn't a lot I could do with the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.750 
there wasn't a lot I could do with the
car<00:04:29.480> during<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.140> second<00:04:30.470> half<00:04:30.590> but<00:04:30.890> we're

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
car during the second half but we're

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.310 
car during the second half but we're
going<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.940> put<00:04:32.060> new<00:04:32.210> tires<00:04:32.420> on<00:04:32.660> for<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:32.960> second

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
going to put new tires on for the second

00:04:33.320 --> 00:06:26.970 
going to put new tires on for the second
race<00:04:33.440> I<00:04:33.620> think<00:04:33.800> we'll<00:04:33.920> be<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.070> lot<00:04:34.250> stronger

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.800
