00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 Xeon woman's service and duck leg Yes we came apart from the teacher 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 Did not you come in a variety of defensive streams just like you played today ? 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.570
 This is why Hong Myung-bo's defensive troubles and the reason why the cows are so disgusted . 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.029
 I think you are. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 Now let's hear the story about the mother's sensitivity Korean director Hong, let's meet 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.990
 Fall to the last minute today, played quite hard when the island but four defeats 0 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 came 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:33.989
 The cause of the defeat is to write to where it is due to two mistakes we made 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 I think we did not have that easy pie anymore. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.739
 The athletes 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 1 schematically came out well 220 defined as the Ducks new mistakes, rather than the more energetic 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.980
 Like I am going to get hit him full 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.820
 I used the tools in the reverse side window to give those two goals to the old version. 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 Oh dwaeseo the values that I dugetda and focus on how to yesterday, the reciprocal blocking 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 See, because somehow failed to accomplish any good yeotgi any issues 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.800
 Well, the first thing we missed is our Wan 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 It was a perfect mistake and the second 10 years old c 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.460
 Uh counterattack, but the situation is that we had to end the problem of what to Vote 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.979
 It was not a situation but there 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.840
 Uh I want the inside staring shone in this case, 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 I do not think it 's a big mistake, 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 j what little control I think that the player seems to be temporarily connected to the Lan 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.450
 4 And almost as soon as the second half started to be injected into the Red professors and use Players 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.710
 Even though've even tip the fast life of 500 full license ate the dying 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 Export the best members for its part feels ate DE CORPS 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.049
 I do not know why he did it. 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.939
 However, now and then something like Ho was a little bit in turn delays ever 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:55.590
 It was not a perfect situation, but, uh, 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:00.930
 2 seeing a run and seeing a lot of intense attention 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.110
 In late dwaetneunde make a mistake doing yet to be disappointed by what you're too early 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 I have prepared well during the China Mo period I thought , 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.660
 I think it's more important to look good . 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.660
 I've been to the pursuit of L's team, Mr. Hongo.
