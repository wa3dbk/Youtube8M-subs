in<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:14.050> top<00:00:14.380> end<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.620> Queensland<00:00:15.689> let's<00:00:16.689> just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
in the top end of Queensland let's just

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.649 
in the top end of Queensland let's just
show<00:00:17.080> you<00:00:17.170> what's<00:00:17.349> going<00:00:17.680> on<00:00:17.769> here<00:00:18.599> all<00:00:19.599> the

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:19.659 
show you what's going on here all the

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:21.870 
show you what's going on here all the
parts<00:00:20.499> are<00:00:20.619> being<00:00:20.769> designed<00:00:20.890> in<00:00:21.220> CAD<00:00:21.460> we'll

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
parts are being designed in CAD we'll

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.640 
parts are being designed in CAD we'll
just<00:00:22.119> start<00:00:22.359> animate<00:00:23.019> that<00:00:23.199> for<00:00:23.409> you<00:00:23.499> so<00:00:23.619> you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
just start animate that for you so you

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.519 
just start animate that for you so you
can<00:00:23.800> see<00:00:24.039> it<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.300> finished<00:00:28.810> robot<00:00:29.230> will<00:00:29.380> look

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
can see it the finished robot will look

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.339 
can see it the finished robot will look
something<00:00:29.800> like<00:00:29.919> this<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:31.929> program

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
something like this now to the program

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.930 
something like this now to the program
we're<00:00:32.529> using<00:00:32.770> today<00:00:33.130> to<00:00:33.160> cut<00:00:33.460> this<00:00:33.579> out<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.910> a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
we're using today to cut this out is a

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.049 
we're using today to cut this out is a
little<00:00:34.210> program<00:00:34.390> called<00:00:34.630> V<00:00:34.989> curve<00:00:35.260> Pro<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:37.000> a

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
little program called V curve Pro it's a

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.790 
little program called V curve Pro it's a
great<00:00:37.300> program<00:00:37.600> I'll<00:00:38.079> just<00:00:38.320> show<00:00:38.469> you<00:00:38.500> here

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
great program I'll just show you here

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.319 
great program I'll just show you here
one<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> great<00:00:39.399> one<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.180> good

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
one of the great one of the good

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.970 
one of the great one of the good
features<00:00:40.539> that<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:40.930> find<00:00:41.230> about<00:00:41.320> this<00:00:41.559> program

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
features that I find about this program

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.849 
features that I find about this program
is<00:00:42.129> its<00:00:42.309> ability<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.760> actually<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:44.140> bone<00:00:44.410> and

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
is its ability to actually to bone and

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.669 
is its ability to actually to bone and
I'll<00:00:44.980> show<00:00:45.129> you<00:00:45.190> what<00:00:45.309> boning<00:00:45.730> is<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.350> can<00:00:47.500> see

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
I'll show you what boning is you can see

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.579 
I'll show you what boning is you can see
there<00:00:47.920> when<00:00:48.789> you<00:00:48.910> use<00:00:49.059> around<00:00:49.420> n<00:00:49.629> mil<00:00:49.839> as<00:00:50.079> you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
there when you use around n mil as you

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.110 
there when you use around n mil as you
come<00:00:50.739> into<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.980> corner<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.670> corner<00:00:52.000> will

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
come into a corner your corner will

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.639 
come into a corner your corner will
always<00:00:52.329> be<00:00:52.539> curved<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:53.079> won't<00:00:53.260> allow<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
always be curved and won't allow you to

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.979 
always be curved and won't allow you to
fit<00:00:53.949> in<00:00:54.070> your<00:00:54.219> parts<00:00:54.609> properly<00:00:55.539> because<00:00:55.780> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
fit in your parts properly because the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.380 
fit in your parts properly because the
curve<00:00:56.199> will<00:00:56.410> restrict<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:57.010> v<00:00:57.760> curve<00:00:58.059> has<00:00:58.239> this

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
curve will restrict it v curve has this

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.299 
curve will restrict it v curve has this
feature<00:00:58.660> called<00:00:58.929> boning<00:00:59.410> which<00:00:59.800> allows<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
feature called boning which allows the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.279 
feature called boning which allows the
tool<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.640> cut<00:01:00.760> into<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.120> material<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.749> then

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
tool to cut into the material and then

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.470 
tool to cut into the material and then
come<00:01:02.530> back<00:01:02.559> out<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.190> your<00:01:03.730> end<00:01:03.940> points<00:01:04.269> still

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
come back out so your end points still

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.030 
come back out so your end points still
the<00:01:04.570> same<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.199> gives<00:01:05.620> these<00:01:05.800> little

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the same but it gives these little

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.680 
the same but it gives these little
reliefs<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.550> it<00:01:06.640> allows<00:01:06.850> your<00:01:07.060> part<00:01:07.360> one<00:01:07.660> of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
reliefs and it allows your part one of

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.940 
reliefs and it allows your part one of
the<00:01:07.810> lead<00:01:07.960> parts<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.440> slide<00:01:08.710> in<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:08.950> fit<00:01:09.160> snugly

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the lead parts to slide in to fit snugly

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.290 
the lead parts to slide in to fit snugly
another<00:01:11.950> good<00:01:12.160> thing<00:01:12.190> with<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.730> car<00:01:12.970> Pro<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
another good thing with the car Pro is

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.990 
another good thing with the car Pro is
its<00:01:13.510> ability<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:13.960> actually<00:01:14.920> simulate<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.580> cut

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
its ability to actually simulate and cut

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.660 
its ability to actually simulate and cut
out<00:01:16.120> all<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.390> parts<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.070> reset<00:01:18.520> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
out all the parts so if we reset that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.610 
out all the parts so if we reset that
preview<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.740> preview<00:01:21.120> all<00:01:22.120> tool<00:01:22.420> paths<00:01:25.620> and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
preview and preview all tool paths and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.030 
preview and preview all tool paths and
you'll<00:01:27.040> see<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.340> again<00:01:27.730> sorry<00:01:28.330> there<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:28.870> go

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.730 

and<00:01:33.040> now<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:34.180> will<00:01:34.330> created<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.380> drilling

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
and now it will created a drilling

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.550 
and now it will created a drilling
pocket<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.370> profile<00:01:36.820> tool<00:01:37.060> pass<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.470> is

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
pocket and profile tool pass and this is

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.030 
pocket and profile tool pass and this is
where<00:01:38.740> up<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.950> at<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> moment<00:01:40.800> here's<00:01:41.800> some

the underneath side of the other one you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.410 
the underneath side of the other one you
can<00:01:49.840> see<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.260> boning<00:01:50.710> feature<00:01:50.980> here<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
can see this boning feature here in the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.650 
can see this boning feature here in the
screen<00:01:52.720> now<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.210> what<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.420> looks<00:01:55.600> like

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
screen now this is what it looks like

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.820 
screen now this is what it looks like
and<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.410> might<00:01:56.620> start<00:01:57.250> milling<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.530> we'll<00:01:59.710> turn

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
and we might start milling so we'll turn

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.740 
and we might start milling so we'll turn
on<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.070> spindle
