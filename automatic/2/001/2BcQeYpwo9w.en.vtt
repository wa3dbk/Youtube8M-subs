00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.740
 daredevil from mark wade their ducking matt 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 Apraksin in my opinion two of the best 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.200
 ongoingov appeared in marvel 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.570
 science 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.639
 both bright both original and up 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 ugliness is simple but it is this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.109
 simplicity and made these two series such 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.600
 Popularity among critics and among 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.830
 usually readers if daredevil we 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 sorted out one of the previous 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.650
 releases tass spider im so far nothing 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:36.300
 it is not clear what Hawkeye from Matt friction 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 and for the kind of aha aha let's start with the name 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 comic book is translated from English 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 like a hawk eye and precisely under such 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 Many people remember this nickname 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
 people in our area but as we all know 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.260
 comme il faut loves to experiment 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.940
 and as a result in Russian ongoing wears 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 the sonorous name of the spider and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 within a radius of several thousand kilometers 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.710
 bright flashes were seen bombing of 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.109
 supposedly 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 And what a fig daredevil they translated a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.260
 this is not I have some ideas on 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.449
 this account 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 Well, firstly, do not you think that the name 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.619
 falcon eye for the title of the comic but 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 too healthy and let's say not directly 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 very nice and second this connection 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 what impressions do you have 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.259
 hawk from the movie we will not say directly 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 the brightest and expressive 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.790
 and that is exactly the cinema image filled 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.340
 our residents clint barton neck of this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.049
 the comic is completely different and different from 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.030
 movie Vova option by so many 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 qualities that is thereby comme il faut 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 want to show the differences between these two versions 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.229
 but a falcon eye postscript publishers all 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.170
 same done what is so good new series 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.270
 yes, literally everyone's drawing history is common 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.030
 the mood of what's happening is all on 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 level drawing by David aha i think is stupid 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 brilliant amazing how cool 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.780
 looks cute narrow on the style of our time 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 when hyperrealism is everywhere and gloomy then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.149
 and what are sometimes the original 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.310
 frames nothing superfluous but at the same time 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.469
 the picture is not empty and very dynamic 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.390
 as if the artists of a new wave of 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.159
 marvel trying to tell the reader what 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.869
 it is not necessary to draw each 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.210
 muscle on the hero's arm or 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.950
 hypertrophic girls with breasts 40 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.080
 size to be cool 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.510
 draftsman 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 chip completely different and here I am definitely 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.890
 on the side of artists like paul 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.380
 riviera marcos martin and david ohara their 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.060
 my style is much closer and more pleasant each 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.100
 one or two numbers is separate 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.990
 the story is not related to each other then 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.030
 there is a structure the same as that of boards 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.610
 daredevil screenwriter mate friction 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.470
 has a good sense of humor in kai 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.750
 constantly plunge into some creepy 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.000
 trouble and most often the hero is ready 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.730
 shake hands of death but he always 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 smiles and astrid spidea wedge 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.900
 barton gets into different awkward 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.720
 situations related to kasom nudity and 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.030
 girls in general and his partner 2 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.290
 hawkai that will help the character 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.630
 throughout the series 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.610
 plant with him learning peculiar amusing 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.070
 relationships that can not cause 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.200
 a good smile from the reader is the area in which 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.720
 lives kart barton roof and for the Russians 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.270
 Mafia in sweat and what a pancake 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.340
 cool these guys i don't know where they came from 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.990
 these are authors but Russians in the comic through 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.810
 every word is said bro 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.790
 It seems to be nonsense on pipets as fun the most 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.160
 cool that ongoing can start reading 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.200
 not really familiar with marvel people like 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.239
 written at the beginning of each number wedge 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.430
 barton he's the hulk and became the best 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.470
 shooter in the world then he joined 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.300
 the avengers and how much does he do 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.150
 free time is all you need 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.430
 know and this is really true edition 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.560
 comme il faut happened as always cool tpp 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.560
 glossy pages great design 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.450
 translating everything as we love the end of the book no 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.060
 no additional materials that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.780
 a little upset about 140 comics 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.910
 pages 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.130
 and that the first five numbers and ongoingi 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 single yank bangers present hawkai 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.239
 which you understand a little bit 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.700
 is the clientâ€™s partner 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.440
 barton if for you some kind of boring 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
 the guy with the bow and arrow is more likely 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.090
 run the nearest comedian shops buy 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.940
 I personally completely changed this book 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.269
 the opinion of this hero with you was lesha m and 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.410
 and shmali considers comics to all adidas 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.410
 countries costume mustache bald head and cross bro
