hey<00:00:00.810> everyone's<00:00:01.170> metal<00:00:01.439> shop<00:00:01.589> blogs<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:03.110> was

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hey everyone's metal shop blogs I was

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.880 
hey everyone's metal shop blogs I was
doing<00:00:04.710> some<00:00:04.830> triple<00:00:05.100> trees<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.930> I<00:00:06.930> was<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
doing some triple trees and I was on the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.759 
doing some triple trees and I was on the
last<00:00:08.099> step<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.820> rounding<00:00:09.210> them<00:00:09.330> off<00:00:09.769> I'm

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
last step I was rounding them off I'm

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.610 
last step I was rounding them off I'm
cleaning<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> edges<00:00:11.849> where<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.620> milling

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
cleaning the edges where the milling

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.170 
cleaning the edges where the milling
marks<00:00:13.799> are<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:15.109> on<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.440> one<00:00:16.710> apparently<00:00:17.550> my

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
marks are and on this one apparently my

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.980 
marks are and on this one apparently my
milling<00:00:18.900> vet<00:00:19.109> had<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:20.600> little<00:00:21.600> bit<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
milling vet had a little bit of a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.740 
milling vet had a little bit of a
protrusion<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> left<00:00:23.580> nice<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.539> rings

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
protrusion and it left nice little rings

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
protrusion and it left nice little rings
on<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> course<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.859> can't<00:00:26.099> when<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
on it and of course you can't when you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.099 
on it and of course you can't when you
paint<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.060> you'll<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> Rings

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
paint that you'll see the Rings

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
paint that you'll see the Rings
if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.710> powder<00:00:29.519> coat<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:30.000> chrome<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> whatever

if you powder coat it chrome it whatever
you'll<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> rings<00:00:32.180> it's<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.239> right<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you'll see the rings it's all right to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.030 
you'll see the rings it's all right to
clean<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.780> off<00:00:34.219> now<00:00:36.110> you<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.290> use<00:00:37.469> sandpaper

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
clean that off now you can use sandpaper

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.639 
clean that off now you can use sandpaper
on<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.969> sanding<00:00:39.719> wheel<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> do

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
on a sanding wheel which I'm going to do

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.670 
on a sanding wheel which I'm going to do
but<00:00:41.340> since<00:00:42.030> they're<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> deep<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.410> going

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
but since they're kind of deep I'm going

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
but since they're kind of deep I'm going
to<00:00:43.739> start<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:44.370> using<00:00:45.379> just<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.670> grinder<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> I'm

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to start by using just a grinder and I'm

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:01.540 
to start by using just a grinder and I'm
basically<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.530> to

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.970 

thank<00:01:02.480> you

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
thank you

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.280 
thank you
I'm<00:01:04.489> gonna<00:01:04.640> go<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.030> whole<00:01:05.180> surface<00:01:05.510> until<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
I'm gonna go the whole surface until the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.270 
I'm gonna go the whole surface until the
rings<00:01:06.860> are<00:01:08.050> basically<00:01:09.050> gone<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.070> what's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
rings are basically gone but what's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.250 
rings are basically gone but what's
going<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.460> happen<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.030> using<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.840> grinder<00:01:12.229> like

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
going to happen is using a grinder like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.800 
going to happen is using a grinder like
that<00:01:12.619> you're<00:01:13.490> going<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.670> wave<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.119> surface<00:01:14.600> so

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
that you're going to wave the surface so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.219 
that you're going to wave the surface so
if<00:01:15.010> somebody<00:01:16.010> gets<00:01:16.190> it<00:01:16.340> chrome<00:01:16.640> plated<00:01:17.229> or

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
if somebody gets it chrome plated or

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.430 
if somebody gets it chrome plated or
powder<00:01:18.560> coated<00:01:19.070> if<00:01:19.190> there's<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:19.900> deeper<00:01:20.900> spot

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
powder coated if there's a deeper spot

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.800 
powder coated if there's a deeper spot
where<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.830> grinder<00:01:22.250> cut<00:01:22.550> more<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.540> going<00:01:23.750> to

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
where the grinder cut more it's going to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.180 
where the grinder cut more it's going to
show<00:01:23.990> up<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:24.470> going<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.619> look<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:24.770> crap

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
show up so it's going to look like crap

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.160 
show up so it's going to look like crap
so<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.290> do<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.820> I'll<00:01:28.820> show<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.210> in<00:01:29.630> a

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
so what you do is I'll show you in a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.790 
so what you do is I'll show you in a
second<00:01:30.619> after<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:30.920> clean<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:31.250> off<00:01:32.020> okay<00:01:33.020> like

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
second after I clean this off okay like

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.590 
second after I clean this off okay like
30<00:01:34.070> seconds<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.670> got<00:01:34.700> all<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.240> them<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:37.600> it

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
30 seconds I got all of them now it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.400 
30 seconds I got all of them now it
feels<00:01:38.869> smooth<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.500> touch<00:01:40.869> not<00:01:41.869> like<00:01:42.080> glass

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
feels smooth to the touch not like glass

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.260 
feels smooth to the touch not like glass
of<00:01:42.800> course<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.220> mean<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.460> would<00:01:43.550> take<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.729> finer

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
of course I mean it would take a finer

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.770 
of course I mean it would take a finer
sandpaper<00:01:44.720> well<00:01:45.619> first<00:01:46.039> step<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.610> what<00:01:47.330> I<00:01:47.360> do<00:01:47.479> is

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
sandpaper well first step I what I do is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
sandpaper well first step I what I do is
I<00:01:47.899> lay<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.289> I<00:01:48.530> start<00:01:49.490> cutting<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:50.000> at<00:01:50.090> an<00:01:50.210> angle

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.620 

it's<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.760> hard<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.560> because<00:02:17.630> of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
it's not hard to do on this because of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.510 
it's not hard to do on this because of
the<00:02:18.780> shape<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> wheel<00:02:19.680> tries<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.160> go<00:02:20.280> off

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the shape so the wheel tries to go off

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.479 
the shape so the wheel tries to go off
of<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.200> careful<00:02:22.489> and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
of it you just have to be careful and

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.089 
of it you just have to be careful and
then<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.849> next<00:02:24.120> thing<00:02:24.209> will<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.770> will<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.800> over

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
then the next thing will be will go over

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.890 
then the next thing will be will go over
to<00:02:26.310> one<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.489> these<00:02:26.730> it's<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.650> delta<00:02:28.650> rockwell

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180 

just<00:02:33.920> belt<00:02:34.920> sander<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.810> no<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.860> have<00:02:38.010> any

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
just belt sander and no I don't have any

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.949 
just belt sander and no I don't have any
senior<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.730> never<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.120> sandpaper<00:02:39.569> for<00:02:39.840> this

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
senior I never get sandpaper for this

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.979 
senior I never get sandpaper for this
piece<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.970> used<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.569> would<00:02:42.720> be<00:02:42.810> good

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
piece I used to and this would be good

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.140 
piece I used to and this would be good
because<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.680> fit<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.220> whole<00:02:44.370> triple<00:02:44.790> tree<00:02:45.000> on

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
because you fit the whole triple tree on

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
because you fit the whole triple tree on
there<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.799> but<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> center<00:02:47.370> it

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
there like this but in the center it

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.670 
there like this but in the center it
would<00:02:47.549> cut<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.060> difference<00:02:48.450> less<00:02:49.260> speed

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
would cut a little difference less speed

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.400 
would cut a little difference less speed
so<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.790> more<00:02:51.000> even<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.630> basically<00:02:52.290> just

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
so this is more even I basically just

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.880 
so this is more even I basically just
turn<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.920> on<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.510> stand<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:55.049> against<00:02:55.709> it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
turn it on and stand this up against it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.970 
turn it on and stand this up against it
and<00:02:56.660> apply<00:02:57.660> light<00:02:57.930> pressure<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> top<00:02:58.709> and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
and apply light pressure to the top and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.500 
and apply light pressure to the top and
bottom<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.519> then<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:01.230> will<00:03:01.650> smooth<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.099> out

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
bottom and then it will smooth it out

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.410 
bottom and then it will smooth it out
evenly<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.110> let's<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.760> okay<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.790> sanded

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
evenly so let's see that okay I sanded

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.500 
evenly so let's see that okay I sanded
on<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:07.080> probably<00:03:07.700> six<00:03:08.700> passes<00:03:10.940> and<00:03:11.940> you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
on it for probably six passes and you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.050 
on it for probably six passes and you
can<00:03:12.660> see<00:03:12.959> with<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.739> darker<00:03:14.220> area<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.819> where

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
can see with this darker area is where

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.820 
can see with this darker area is where
it's<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.330> cutting<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.080> lighter<00:03:16.380> areas

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
it's not cutting this lighter areas

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's not cutting this lighter areas
where<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.160> cut<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:19.220> flat<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:21.989> can<00:03:22.200> see

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
where it cut and is flat so you can see

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.810 
where it cut and is flat so you can see
where<00:03:22.500> your<00:03:22.620> high<00:03:22.769> spots<00:03:23.160> are<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.549> your<00:03:23.700> low

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
where your high spots are and your low

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.020 
where your high spots are and your low
spots<00:03:24.150> low<00:03:24.359> spot<00:03:24.690> high<00:03:25.320> spot<00:03:25.680> high<00:03:26.070> spot<00:03:26.430> low

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
spots low spot high spot high spot low

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.020 
spots low spot high spot high spot low
spot<00:03:27.060> through<00:03:27.660> here<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.950> low<00:03:29.190> spot<00:03:29.489> here

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
spot through here and a low spot here

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.099 
spot through here and a low spot here
and<00:03:31.280> high<00:03:32.280> around<00:03:32.549> here<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.299> probably<00:03:33.989> and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
and high around here so probably and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.530 
and high around here so probably and
around<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.560> edge<00:03:34.829> right<00:03:34.859> here<00:03:35.100> with<00:03:35.400> a

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
around this edge right here with a

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.150 
around this edge right here with a
sander<00:03:36.540> cut<00:03:37.290> into<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.709> not<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> big<00:03:38.220> deal

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
sander cut into it not a big deal

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.009 
sander cut into it not a big deal
because<00:03:41.160> after<00:03:41.670> six<00:03:41.880> more<00:03:42.150> passes<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:42.840> will

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
because after six more passes this will

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.819 
because after six more passes this will
be<00:03:43.200> or<00:03:43.950> seven<00:03:44.940> or<00:03:45.090> ten<00:03:45.329> however<00:03:45.840> many<00:03:46.319> this

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
be or seven or ten however many this

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.819 
be or seven or ten however many this
will<00:03:46.980> be<00:03:47.069> completely<00:03:49.459> flat<00:03:50.780> now<00:03:51.780> let<00:03:52.709> me

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
will be completely flat now let me

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.840 
will be completely flat now let me
finish<00:03:52.950> that<00:03:53.100> off<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.519> show<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.670> what<00:03:53.790> it

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
finish that off and show you what it

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.330 
finish that off and show you what it
look<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.650> okay<00:03:55.650> now<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:55.889> can<00:03:55.980> see<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
look like okay now you can see the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.800 
look like okay now you can see the
difference<00:03:56.959> see<00:03:57.959> how<00:03:58.049> it's<00:03:58.170> all<00:03:58.319> one<00:03:58.590> color

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
difference see how it's all one color

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.110 
difference see how it's all one color
it's<00:04:00.810> flat<00:04:01.139> I'm<00:04:02.069> gonna<00:04:02.250> be<00:04:02.310> polished<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:02.880> now

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
it's flat I'm gonna be polished out now

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.440 
it's flat I'm gonna be polished out now
there's<00:04:03.389> one<00:04:03.750> little<00:04:04.139> edge<00:04:04.470> right<00:04:04.769> here<00:04:05.450> that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
there's one little edge right here that

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.610 
there's one little edge right here that
I<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:07.910> hit<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.720> mean<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.350> feels

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I have to hit it but it I mean it feels

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.069 
I have to hit it but it I mean it feels
really<00:04:11.370> smooth<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.760> can<00:04:12.150> feel<00:04:12.359> those<00:04:12.780> lines

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
really smooth you can feel those lines

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.490 
really smooth you can feel those lines
ever<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.769> slightly<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:15.120> now<00:04:15.350> it'll<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.380> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
ever so slightly but now it'll be a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.430 
ever so slightly but now it'll be a
simple<00:04:17.010> matter<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.549> hitting<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.810> finer

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
simple matter of hitting it with a finer

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.300 
simple matter of hitting it with a finer
sandpaper<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.810> scotch<00:04:21.810> brite<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.349> then<00:04:23.159> it

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
sandpaper and scotch brite and then it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.860 
sandpaper and scotch brite and then it
will

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
will

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.410 
will
you<00:04:24.860> know<00:04:24.950> close<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.400> mirror<00:04:25.670> finish<00:04:25.760> and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
you know close to a mirror finish and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.980 
you know close to a mirror finish and
accept<00:04:27.110> chrome<00:04:27.500> powder<00:04:28.490> coating<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.780> see<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
accept chrome powder coating to see a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.960 
accept chrome powder coating to see a
little<00:04:30.170> bit<00:04:30.320> around<00:04:30.560> here<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.520> right<00:04:31.700> here

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
little bit around here and right here

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.320 
little bit around here and right here
that<00:04:32.120> still<00:04:32.330> needs<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.660> hit<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:34.330> that's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
that still needs to be hit but that's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.360 
that still needs to be hit but that's
the<00:04:35.570> biggest<00:04:35.780> thing<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.230> big<00:04:36.500> surfaces<00:04:37.190> like

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
the biggest thing on big surfaces like

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.520 
the biggest thing on big surfaces like
this<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:38.420> want<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.720> make<00:04:38.870> sure<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.200> get<00:04:39.410> them

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
this you want to make sure you get them

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.160 
this you want to make sure you get them
as<00:04:39.680> smooth<00:04:40.010> as<00:04:40.250> possible<00:04:40.420> because<00:04:41.420> any<00:04:41.870> waves

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
as smooth as possible because any waves

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.500 
as smooth as possible because any waves
in<00:04:42.560> it<00:04:42.650> will<00:04:43.460> show<00:04:43.490> up<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.240> chrome

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
in it will show up with the chrome

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.720 
in it will show up with the chrome
because<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.230> light<00:04:45.410> will<00:04:45.620> refract<00:04:45.950> off<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.610> it

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
because the light will refract off of it

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.490 
because the light will refract off of it
and<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.210> show<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.290> off<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:51.110> can<00:04:51.230> see<00:04:51.380> this

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
and and show it off and you can see this

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.980 
and and show it off and you can see this
light<00:04:51.770> here<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:53.030> shouldn't<00:04:53.570> that<00:04:53.750> light

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
light here it shouldn't that light

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.660 
light here it shouldn't that light
should<00:04:54.200> reflect<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.040> all<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.580> way

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
should reflect like that all the way

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.820 
should reflect like that all the way
across<00:04:58.030> if<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.180> see<00:04:59.360> that<00:04:59.540> light<00:04:59.750> dip<00:05:00.140> down<00:05:00.410> of

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
across if you see that light dip down of

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.260 
across if you see that light dip down of
course<00:05:01.070> they'll<00:05:01.250> change<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.640> little<00:05:01.790> bit<00:05:02.030> from

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
course they'll change a little bit from

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.790 
course they'll change a little bit from
my<00:05:02.450> angle<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.370> can<00:05:04.490> see<00:05:04.640> how<00:05:04.760> it<00:05:04.850> kind<00:05:05.060> of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
my angle but you can see how it kind of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.720 
my angle but you can see how it kind of
fills<00:05:06.800> this<00:05:07.010> little<00:05:07.250> area<00:05:07.400> right<00:05:07.580> here

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
fills this little area right here

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.710 
fills this little area right here
quicker<00:05:08.330> now<00:05:09.760> triple<00:05:10.760> trees<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.180> front<00:05:11.510> ends

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
quicker now triple trees a front ends

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.630 
quicker now triple trees a front ends
are<00:05:11.810> easy<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.140> make<00:05:12.320> guys<00:05:14.140> you<00:05:15.140> know<00:05:15.640> frames

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
are easy to make guys you know frames

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.690 
are easy to make guys you know frames
you<00:05:17.210> have<00:05:17.330> a<00:05:17.390> lot<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:18.770> know<00:05:18.800> mounts<00:05:19.520> and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
you have a lot of you know mounts and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.660 
you have a lot of you know mounts and
stuff<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.090> do<00:05:20.560> but<00:05:21.560> front<00:05:21.920> ends<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.340> basically

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
stuff to do but front ends is basically

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.260 
stuff to do but front ends is basically
the<00:05:22.820> hardest<00:05:23.030> parts<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.600> triple<00:05:23.930> trees<00:05:24.200> and

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
the hardest parts the triple trees and

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.550 
the hardest parts the triple trees and
you<00:05:26.270> can<00:05:26.420> buy<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.630> springs<00:05:27.110> for<00:05:27.380> doing

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
you can buy the springs for doing

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.490 
you can buy the springs for doing
sprinters<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.910> rockers<00:05:29.420> are<00:05:29.600> easy<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:30.020> make

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
sprinters the rockers are easy to make

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.820 
sprinters the rockers are easy to make
it's<00:05:31.010> basically<00:05:32.200> let<00:05:33.200> me<00:05:33.290> see<00:05:33.440> if<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.650> have<00:05:33.770> a

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
it's basically let me see if I have a

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.200 
it's basically let me see if I have a
tape<00:05:34.070> measure<00:05:34.100> handy<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:36.500> mean<00:05:37.160> all<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.790> all

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
tape measure handy I mean all this all

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.510 
tape measure handy I mean all this all
this<00:05:38.540> is<00:05:38.600> like<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.650> distance<00:05:40.040> from<00:05:40.160> here<00:05:40.460> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
this is like the distance from here to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.140 
this is like the distance from here to
here<00:05:41.380> just<00:05:42.380> determines<00:05:42.890> you<00:05:43.100> know<00:05:43.250> you're

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
here just determines you know you're

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.750 
here just determines you know you're
only<00:05:44.240> limited<00:05:44.510> by<00:05:44.720> what<00:05:44.960> will<00:05:45.200> you<00:05:45.440> use<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:48.760> let

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
only limited by what will you use so let

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.870 
only limited by what will you use so let
me<00:05:49.880> get<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.060> tape<00:05:50.420> measure<00:05:50.450> oh<00:05:51.460> yeah<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.610> got<00:05:52.850> a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
me get a tape measure oh yeah I got a

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.540 
me get a tape measure oh yeah I got a
tape<00:05:53.030> measure<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:54.200> ones<00:05:54.680> I<00:05:54.830> do<00:05:54.950> or<00:05:55.280> nine

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
tape measure the ones I do or nine

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.910 
tape measure the ones I do or nine
Center<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.270> Center<00:05:56.630> so<00:05:57.080> if<00:05:57.410> I<00:05:57.470> put<00:05:57.650> that<00:05:57.680> in<00:05:57.830> the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
Center to Center so if I put that in the

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.590 
Center to Center so if I put that in the
center<00:05:58.250> and<00:05:58.310> come<00:05:58.460> over<00:05:58.580> here<00:05:58.700> be<00:05:59.030> nine<00:05:59.240> and

center and come over here be nine and
you<00:06:02.600> could<00:06:02.750> they<00:06:03.020> could<00:06:03.080> be<00:06:03.290> ten<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:04.370> can<00:06:04.520> be

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
you could they could be ten that can be

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.180 
you could they could be ten that can be
eight<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:06.410> you<00:06:06.560> just<00:06:06.710> have<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:06.980> make<00:06:07.130> sure

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
eight that you just have to make sure

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.230 
eight that you just have to make sure
