sue hawks and today i'm going to talk to
you<00:00:11.160> about<00:00:11.340> induction<00:00:11.969> hobs<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:15.389> Neth

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
you about induction hobs the Neth

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
you about induction hobs the Neth
induction<00:00:16.260> hob<00:00:16.470> comes<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.070> many<00:00:17.250> shapes<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
induction hob comes in many shapes and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.849 
induction hob comes in many shapes and
sizes<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.350> today<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
sizes but the one I have here today is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.880 
sizes but the one I have here today is
called<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.369> flexi<00:00:20.730> induction<00:00:21.210> 600<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.650> got

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
called a flexi induction 600 it's a got

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
called a flexi induction 600 it's a got
a<00:00:22.920> point<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.400> twist<00:00:23.699> control<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> turn<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
a point in twist control so to turn it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
a point in twist control so to turn it
on<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:25.920> lay<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.310> finger<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.390> start

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
on I just lay my finger on the start

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.830 
on I just lay my finger on the start
button<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.680> then<00:00:29.189> tilt<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> point<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> twist

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
button I then tilt the point and twist

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.680 
button I then tilt the point and twist
and<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> turn<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> way<00:00:32.099> around<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.690> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and I turn it all the way around now I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
and I turn it all the way around now I
have<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> pan<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.739> which<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> ferrous

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
have a pan here which has got a ferrous

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.330 
have a pan here which has got a ferrous
content<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.840> means<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.649> magnetic<00:00:38.309> so

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
content this means that it's magnetic so

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
content this means that it's magnetic so
if<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.000> point<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> twist<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
if I take my point and twist which is a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
if I take my point and twist which is a
magnet<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.219> put<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> bottom<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
magnet and I put it to the bottom of the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
magnet and I put it to the bottom of the
pan<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> pan<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pan you can see that this pan is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
pan you can see that this pan is
magnetic<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.539> I'll<00:00:45.600> pop<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.840> back<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.410> there

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
magnetic so I'll pop that back on there

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.350 
magnetic so I'll pop that back on there
but<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.520> there's<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> pan<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
but if there's not a pan with the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
but if there's not a pan with the
ferrous<00:00:48.629> content<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:49.950> will<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.129> no

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
ferrous content on then there will be no

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
ferrous content on then there will be no
heat<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.390> turn<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> button<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
heat in here I can turn this button on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.150 
heat in here I can turn this button on
all<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.160> way<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.640> 9<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.800> hand<00:00:56.010> on

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
all the way up to 9 and put my hand on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
all the way up to 9 and put my hand on
there<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> they'll<00:00:56.730> never<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.239> any<00:00:57.420> heat<00:00:57.690> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
there and they'll never be any heat on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
there and they'll never be any heat on
there<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> things<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.309> love<00:00:59.609> about

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
there one of the things I love about

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.330 
there one of the things I love about
this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.510> easy<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> clean<00:01:01.590> from

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this is how easy it is to clean from

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.100 
this is how easy it is to clean from
having<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> gas<00:01:02.879> hob<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> had<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> clean

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
having a gas hob before I had to clean

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
having a gas hob before I had to clean
all<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> pan<00:01:04.769> supports<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> things<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
all the pan supports and things like

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
all the pan supports and things like
that<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.840> buff<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.860> an

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that here I can just buff it up with an

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490 
that here I can just buff it up with an
e<00:01:08.070> cloth<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.390> clean<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> ready<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> go

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
e cloth and it's clean and ready to go

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.270 
e cloth and it's clean and ready to go
again<00:01:10.710> now<00:01:11.670> I've<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.280> flexi

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
again now I've got here a flexi

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.630 
again now I've got here a flexi
induction<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.720> means<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
induction and this means that I can

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
induction and this means that I can
arrange<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.939> sorts<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.299> different<00:01:18.509> shapes

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
arrange all sorts of different shapes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.070 
arrange all sorts of different shapes
pans<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.729> smaller<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> larger<00:01:21.060> pans<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
pans and smaller and larger pans on the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
pans and smaller and larger pans on the
zones<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:23.009> gives<00:01:23.189> me<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.549> flexible

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
zones and it gives me more flexible

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
zones and it gives me more flexible
cooking<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.280> zone<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.320> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
cooking now I have the zone on and the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.230 
cooking now I have the zone on and the
heat<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> coming<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> base<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.970> pan

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
heat is coming in to the base of the pan

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.260 
heat is coming in to the base of the pan
so<00:01:30.960> only<00:01:31.470> where<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> pan<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.250> touching<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so only where the pan is touching the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.050 
so only where the pan is touching the
zone<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.860> any<00:01:35.040> heat<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.790> nice

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
zone will there be any heat so it's nice

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
zone will there be any heat so it's nice
and<00:01:36.090> efficient<00:01:36.900> also<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.680> quite<00:01:37.829> safe<00:01:38.340> if

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and efficient also it's quite safe if

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.390 
and efficient also it's quite safe if
something<00:01:39.659> does<00:01:39.869> boil<00:01:40.140> over<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.860> quite<00:01:41.100> easy

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
something does boil over it's quite easy

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
something does boil over it's quite easy
we<00:01:41.790> hold<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> control<00:01:42.509> suspension<00:01:42.780> button

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we hold the control suspension button

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
we hold the control suspension button
down<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.070> suspends<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> zones

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
down this suspends all of the zones

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
down this suspends all of the zones
whatever<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.439> cooking<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.340> can

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
whatever we're cooking and we can

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.550 
whatever we're cooking and we can
literally<00:01:48.060> wipe<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.990> zone<00:01:49.229> down<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:51.560> go

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
literally wipe the zone down and go
