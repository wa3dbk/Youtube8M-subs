00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.059
 dear android next reader here is frank 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.300
 and yesterday is the game temple rank 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.240
 two come out a game that one 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.560
 is very successful predecessor had 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.250
 downloaded a few million times 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 been 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.320
 both under ios and under android 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.869
 now is the android version of the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.519
 successor appeared and the game you 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.850
 you will see it soon has a new one 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.740
 grafik engine what the consequence has completely 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.630
 specifically, that the year of the game is clear 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.070
 looks better so the 3d graphics is 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.720
 now much more detailed the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.950
 animations we are much better me 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.660
 Just start here 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.470
 try it on and try the whole thing 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.090
 somehow get back to you 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.220
 to tell something and me at the same time 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.970
 to focus on the game so it 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.880
 stay with it 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.450
 you have to be in front of a monster 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.420
 Run away that was a chase that was in 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.710
 predecessor a band little monkeys here 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.020
 is it sort of like me now? 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.530
 say like an animal so you know 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.120
 maybe from the comics of spiderman 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.040
 so similar looks now here 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.720
 is a bit more impressive 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.600
 become and you see already as said 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
 the game is much better animated 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.250
 the graphics are much much fancier 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.010
 has become and the game is now 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.409
 not so static anymore 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.720
 angle the angles in which you turn 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.970
 in individual streets or how to get there 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.810
 say so because of the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.090
 they are not so right now 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.070
 really but there is easy here 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.280
 sometimes such branches and yes 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.510
 overall, the scenery is as well 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.060
 become more varied so I 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.110
 I've played it before 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.729
 not some rubbish 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.750
 told and am naturally 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.330
 come a little further 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.299
 And there are also height systems 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.870
 and yes, sees all sorts of other scenery 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.729
 great 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.180
 otherwise the game principle has changed 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.550
 not much changed is it still 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.130
 such an endless game of genre 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.050
 has established temple run authoritative 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.420
 Actually, there are also some abklatsch 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.550
 but from my point of view was tempera 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.060
 no one is still the best game in 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 this in style and tempera 2 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.140
 The game now leads to one 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.030
 successful fashion continues and that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.930
 Game is an absolutely worthwhile one 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 download is a bit on 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.100
 a bit higher system requirements i 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.310
 white so it does not does not affect all 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.020
 not quite as liquid anymore 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.580
 one hundred percent as fluid as the as 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.440
 the first part but as I said 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.920
 it is also a bit of a sight 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.780
 a little fancier and so me 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.380
 i can highly recommend this game me 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.209
 Hope you'll enjoy it 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.790
 to lead 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.739
 and yes temple rang two makes big 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.890
 fun gameplay is in principle that 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.630
 same as the predecessor and absolutely 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.080
 worthwhile I'm frank from android 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.200
 next DE and that was temple rank two until 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.200
 soon 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.550
 a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.300
 gulliver fair
