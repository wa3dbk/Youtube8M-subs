00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 today I want you once a 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.730
 absolute favorite anni - imagine 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
 I never take anything about that much 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.120
 like future diaries, most of them are called 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 from you probably will 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 already know for those who do not know 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 now a short plot 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 Resume become the young cinema 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 not very popular and that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 economy as his own world with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.150
 his own god the deus ex machina 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 But someday this world will be 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.060
 Reality so until she is actually 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.070
 Reality and this god is close to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 death and that's why he tries to be 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.550
 successor in a game of life and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.469
 to find death 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 that's why twelve people get involved 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.559
 Diary and need each other 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.420
 kill 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 that means it's time on the characters 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.780
 there we have as said this newco 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.940
 actually less 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 But interesting is also diverse 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 character developments you can do it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 but to see part is already one 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.440
 a little bit out of the way then we come 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.690
 the most interesting character of the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.710
 whole series namely you kai i saw oh 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.180
 my god such a wonderful 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 have wonderful wonderful character 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 I rarely saw it and it just has 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.830
 just as fun to see as the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.840
 always behaves and how sick she was 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.820
 really in the head is the others 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 Diary owners are actually too 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.439
 all relatively individual and beautiful 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.360
 So I pretty much designed it too 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.520
 fallen and there was definitely the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 one or the other place is with me 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 absolutely would not have expected 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.909
 let's go to the music oh my god that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 first operas ingo my god i have it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.689
 I loved it before I did 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.729
 the anime ever started 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.159
 I already loved so really 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.049
 unbelievably cool the second opening is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.509
 also okay there you have to first 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.280
 Wear come after four consequences only when 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.950
 I liked it too 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210
 then the background music there is yes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.899
 this one out 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.270
 my god that is so cool believes 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.500
 the whole thing is just so awesome 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.030
 next we come to the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.579
 animations and again I have to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.070
 just say oh my god i love it 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.229
 simply it's just wonderful me 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.119
 There can not be anything bad about that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.410
 we'll say more animations now 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 these were dear to this anime corp 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 I'll give you the conclusion I think it's one 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.750
 wonderful story even though 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.570
 I have to say that, of course, from the square 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 Little at Battle Royale 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.870
 angel games the hunger games yes 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 actually stolen by battle royal 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.940
 but it was interesting 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 characters wonderful animations 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.200
 Wonderful music is what you want 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.180
 I even have the manga 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.070
 bought and that is so far only at 11 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.570
 song happen that i am in bangkok 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.370
 also bought in the series 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.200
 It must be called something in Elfen's song 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.390
 one of my favorite series and micky 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.170
 it will not be cold yet 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.150
 knows from me here an absolute 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.260
 recommendation or just to be wonderful 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.300
 is great and I give this anime 92 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.130
 of 100 points and as always applies 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.980
 Of course everything is said and remains 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.450
 My opinion if I do not like it 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.740
 do but simply own up 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.740
