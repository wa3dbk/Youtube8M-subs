00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 and look at the fact the system is still 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.899
 entering this in yesterday night 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 It is still above us is 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.490
 moving slowly to the east what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 which is a bit slow is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
 session and in fact we have the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.390
 problem that continues to take it to all the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 today this and we hope that for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.210
 tomorrow in the trivia they call themselves 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.650
 but if we have the probability of 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.539
 forgiveness of snowfall in the area of ​​the sierra 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.820
 and there is a notice that at the level of 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 snow descends to the 4000 hundred feet 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 which will mean that I will be 1200 meters 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 that since it would include what is the part 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.710
 the v of the condor that are 1,400 meters 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 then it is expected that for the night 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 early morning show up 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 snowfall in the area of the Sierra la 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 rain continues this we have accumulation 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 of lives in various parts of the city it 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 told them look we have a station in 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.109
 the fire department here in the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.969
 close them in 12 hours they accumulated 32 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.200
 yesterday millimeters last night 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.360
 today 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.400
 as a nation like 31 millimeters and 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.310
 we at the university accumulate 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.940
 30.5 are in addition to the two of the two 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.370
 in the afternoon yesterday in the morning not 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.250
 is the above in the pasta 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.310
 rains that was on Monday and Tuesday has 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.790
 an accumulated abc of 38.2 firefighters 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.110
 is 34 and conagua has 39.9 and we are going to 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.280
 see what is communicated that tomorrow and has 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 the day after tomorrow the frontal system 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.320
 that is entering to the east is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.180
 almost in half and we have all this this 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.090
 defect of this novelty that is what 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.040
 we foresee that for tomorrow we continue the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530
 today in the night and tomorrow in the greater not 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.940
 they have some remnants of the morning 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.440
 continued the remnants of this 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.200
 system and it is likely that continued the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.640
 rain but less percentage is that 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.770
 today not the day d is expected what 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 stronger the system reducing the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.380
 late and the morning some are created 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 remnants of said system 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 this I'm going to the commissions would be a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 little better this would begin to clear and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.520
 with the consequences that it caused is 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.380
 raining 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.270
 and it's not causing this system of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.900
 low pressure is from the cold front and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.900
 everything is there 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:26.000
 it's a morning by the system being 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.120
 here 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.480
 will go down the level of situations 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 of snow 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.600
 will cause it to be present in the base 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.600
 what is the area in the sierra 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.660
 and in fact here to the towns of we can 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.520
 the east front we carry west 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.770
 that all these rainy areas have 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.530
 part of roses and blues that are and apart 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.850
