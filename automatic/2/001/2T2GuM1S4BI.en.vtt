 "A funeral song for her, doubly dead, who died very young" 

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:23.750
 Guess who found an old fairy costume in the attic 

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:36.375
 We have finally found it! 

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.457
 Lenore Queen of the Gnomes 

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.177
 Little and funny people 

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:53.698
 Tell me ... Can I roll them up and down the hill? 

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:56.586
 Mmm no! 

00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:02.927
 Oh! Great queen! We will take her home! 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.639
 Yes, caaasa! 

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:10.451
 We have been looking for it for years! We were very lost in his absence 

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:12.882
 But I'm not a ... 

00:01:13.102 --> 00:01:16.798
 We all have this old photo to remember it 

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:24.094
 But now that I look at it, it looks a little different. This is you? 

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:33.018
 Hmmm ... yes ... it's me 

00:01:34.297 --> 00:01:37.642
 We are going to return to our magical world 

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:48.423
 Wow! There are millions of you guys! 

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:53.128
 Yes, we have been bored, so we have grown a lot in number 

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.487
 Wow! Can you do that just because you're bored? 

00:01:57.738 --> 00:02:01.724
 Well ... there's been nothing to do, so we've been ... 

00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:04.865
 Uh ... doing disgusting ... Hehehe 

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.382
 Disgust? 

00:02:06.382 --> 00:02:08.865
 You know ... making horizontal greetings 

00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:09.555
 What? 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.609
 Ugly pushes ... 

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.089
 Ugly what? ... 

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:20.712
 Doing the beast with two asses? 

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:25.615
 Oh! Where is that beast with two asses? 

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:29.077
 You know ... we're going to forget all this for now 

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:35.988
 OMG! Look at the great queen! Are you watching it? 

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:40.912
 AND NOW A MISTERIOUS NARRATOR OF ANYWHERE 

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:44.568
 And to this day, nobody is sure what the cause was 

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:50.712
 Of the following events. Some say it was the diet that he made that day 

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:55.088
 Others say it was around that time that she was beaten with a garden gnome 

00:02:55.088 --> 00:02:57.545
 By little Billy Nipkiss 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.737
 Some even think that it is related to the mysterious accident 

00:03:00.938 --> 00:03:03.799
 of the Billy Nipkiss puppet that happened immediately after 

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:06.266
 What? 

00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:13.578
 But, whatever the reason, something inside broke 

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:38.188
 AFTER 13 HOURS KILLING GNOMES 

00:03:38.272 --> 00:03:41.750
 Now I just need to find the two-beast beast
