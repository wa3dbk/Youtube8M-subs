00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
crank if you look at this side we'll

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.680 
crank if you look at this side we'll
notice<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.700> has<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.850> very<00:02:26.970> generous

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
notice that it has a very generous

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.880 
notice that it has a very generous
chamfer<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:29.390> whereas<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.630> side<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.830> the

chamfer on it whereas this side is the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.559 
chamfer on it whereas this side is the
same<00:02:32.220> as<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.519> stock<00:02:32.820> rod<00:02:33.120> bearing<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:36.000> chamfer

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
same as a stock rod bearing this chamfer

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.560 
same as a stock rod bearing this chamfer
would<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.860> against<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.580> radius<00:02:39.000> end<00:02:39.300> of

would go up against the radius end of

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.020 
would go up against the radius end of
the<00:02:39.660> journal<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.370> has<00:02:41.519> enough<00:02:41.700> room

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the journal so that it has enough room

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.130

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.780 
main bearing for the Cowley's crank
we'll<00:02:48.930> notice<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.250> rod<00:02:50.400> bearing

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
we'll notice that like the rod bearing

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.319 
we'll notice that like the rod bearing
it's<00:02:51.630> also<00:02:51.870> chamfered<00:02:52.760> however<00:02:53.760> unlike<00:02:54.209> the

it's also chamfered however unlike the
rod<00:02:54.510> bearing<00:02:54.870> there's<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> chamfer<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> both

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
