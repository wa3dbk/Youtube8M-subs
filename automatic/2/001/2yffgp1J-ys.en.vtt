00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 now that I'm here the accountant and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.560
 I am very happy because today we are going to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.050
 make a design with only two enamels 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.219
 that generally as good as 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.219
 they need many colors 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.170
 very few 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.570
 let's see all colors uag in a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.400
 color and bright and I know that it's going to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.740
 like and they will do it in their little ones 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.740
 they were going to show what their ways were 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.990
 these are the tools that you use 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.960
 for today I am also using 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.120
 only two colors one white and one color 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.710
 that in this case is the violet I have the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 base in white so that the colors are 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 much more vibrant and I'll start 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.700
 directly applying the color that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.910
 I chose this is going to be our most 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.910
 Dark 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.250
 very well then apply it can use 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.990
 a green a blue a yellow the tone that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.660
 you choose or the one you have in your 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.580
 home just that we're going to go 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.580
 rinsing with the plate 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.100
 now let's use two tones or two 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.740
 droplets of the tone we chose and one of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.290
 White 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.619
 and let's mix let's use the brush 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.329
 darker at the end was brush they have 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 to clean it very well so that it does not 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.950
 contaminate in its color 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 and do enough to paint 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.650
 their dreams 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.050
 if they are doing the design that I am 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.360
 choosing therefore they have to paint minimum 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.360
 two nails the two indexes 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.550
 well and they paint it like any color of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.090
 enamel 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.770
 very well now is this mixture that already 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.440
 we have what we are going to do very fast to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.930
 that does not dry the enamel that we have 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.390
 in the background we are going to apply two drops of 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.390
 white see as clear 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.530
 Only one color appears in many colors 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.450
 super nice that we can always use 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.850
 even if they want to use them in all 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.890
 signs they do in proportion the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.070
 amount they need for all 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.740
 nails and they paint simply and we already have 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.780
 see the difference 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.090
 it seems that we had many enamels 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.340
 we have simply used 2 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 for the next combination we return to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
 Apply two drops or even three if 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.480
 you want this to not be much 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.230
 clearer and more obvious between 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 the two combinations 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.500
 well and we apply 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.660
 they have to mix it very well or if not the 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.030
 enamel that will apply we will be 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.030
 with streaks of the original color 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.239
 I am using day two drops but as 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.890
 I tell them they can do it much more 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.420
 obvious well we make the mixture 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.440
 we mix very very very very well 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.440
 and we apply 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.340
 how I like to have design 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.079
 then I do not know that I can not stay 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.739
 only with the tones here already 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.870
 we would have a design of shades but 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.110
 I wanted to add to this line 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.790
 simply 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.790
 make it very simple 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.989
 and ready to simply make a line 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.300
 straight with the tool they have and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.459
 Here is our design with different 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.730
 tonalities so that they take advantage of all 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.010
 the enamels they have in their house 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.450
 from today I will leave greetings to all 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.549
 active people who are here in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.409

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.659
 that are still in network status and want 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.090
