00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
actually it's light but it's not like

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
actually it's light but it's not like
like<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.130> leave<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.820> but<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
like I can leave it that way but if you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
like I can leave it that way but if you
like<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.079> over<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.740> foundation

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
like you can go over it with foundation

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.090 
like you can go over it with foundation
and<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.110> touch<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> little

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and just you know touch it up a little

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
and just you know touch it up a little
but<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.090> don't<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> don't

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
but you really don't have to I don't

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.569 
but you really don't have to I don't
think<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.979> anything<00:02:05.219> wrong<00:02:05.520> with

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
think I don't see anything wrong with

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.859 
think I don't see anything wrong with
the<00:02:05.790> scalping<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.659> um<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:08.179> pre-cut<00:02:09.179> part

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the scalping on it um the pre-cut part

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
the scalping on it um the pre-cut part
is<00:02:10.289> pretty<00:02:11.009> thick

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
is pretty thick

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.229 
is pretty thick
here<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:13.040> I'm<00:02:14.040> thinking<00:02:14.519> he's<00:02:14.730> done<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.090> on

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
here and I'm thinking he's done that on

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.940 
here and I'm thinking he's done that on
purpose<00:02:15.269> because<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.620> showing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
purpose because it's really not showing

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.520 
purpose because it's really not showing
anyway<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.540> guess<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.260> doesn't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
anyway so I guess it really doesn't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.199 
anyway so I guess it really doesn't
matter<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.340> looks<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.909> lace-front

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
matter if it looks like a lace-front

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.660 
matter if it looks like a lace-front
seriously<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.099> pretty<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.549> pretty

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
seriously but it's pretty it's pretty

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.089 
seriously but it's pretty it's pretty
thick<00:02:24.060> along<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.569> hairline<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.860> all

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
thick along the hairline but it's all

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
was mixing it's hard for me to go to

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.930 
was mixing it's hard for me to go to
synthetic<00:02:45.989> wigs<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.500> get<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.700> color

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
synthetic wigs and get it in the color

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.880 
synthetic wigs and get it in the color
because<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.420> find<00:02:48.840> synthetic<00:02:49.440> waiting<00:02:49.739> for

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
because I find synthetic waiting for

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.180 
because I find synthetic waiting for
color<00:02:50.129> did<00:02:50.489> look<00:02:50.730> very<00:02:50.760> very<00:02:51.299> cheap<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.950> me

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
color did look very very cheap to me

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.349 
color did look very very cheap to me
that's<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.579> my<00:02:53.849> opinion

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
that's just my opinion

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.599 
that's just my opinion
not<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.530> them<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.280> proof

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
not all of them and this is proof

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.940 
not all of them and this is proof
because<00:02:56.849> this<00:02:57.209> is<00:02:57.329> synthetic<00:02:57.660> hair<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
because this is synthetic hair and it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.030 
because this is synthetic hair and it
