00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 1 hi to all the guys here the student 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.289
 for you with another unboxing despite 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 the computer is dead and buried I can 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.689
 however upload the videos because I step 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.860
 all sharper then loads him 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.899
 we exploit you see what is the use of having a 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.649
 channel mate however you can 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:35.730
 see this wireless stereo today 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:39.870
 official headset only because if 3 that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 however it can also be used on a PC from the place 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.900
 of about 90 euros I bought it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 online 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.620
 shipping costs also begin 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 you see 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 all the multilingual features but 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.570
 rather than doing good in which I 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.750
 let's say it's very good because of it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 youtube wireless is equipped with a microphone 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.550
 as you can see and then the audio 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:10.399
 present it all b digital dolby 7.1 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.399
 however, we proceed to sketch 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:27.240
 we missed a piece like this 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.310
 T-shirt is always useful we extract 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.950
 then as you can see the box here 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.710
 presents with the classic seasoning 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.300
 of the sony tail that found any 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 playstation bow sixaxis oslo al 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.220
 software let the ambulance pass 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.989
 then let's start with this trunk that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 contains the usual warning manual 

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:57.119
 cagate go we can announce it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.739
 video we see this and go with the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.319
 its real before pulling it 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:04.319
 outside, however, we see the contraption that 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:08.819
 allows salary operation 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:12.260
 I extract that it is clarity we say not 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.950
 I know if one foot or just 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.599
 lets you know the 2.4 gb one 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.840
 in short, those who do the same that 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.299
 make wireless mice work 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.900
 follow same technology this city 6 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.849
 in the ps3 each a usb port of the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.909
 computer and allows the coming soon 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.049
 let's try to break the diets 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:41.120
 that present a bill attack on 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:50.629
 card to be able to prevent it from coming to 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:53.379
 contact of the box let's pull it now more 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.379
 easy than it looked and here they are 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.379
 knoll 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.099
 let's go to the description as you see 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.019
 aesthetics is not the best indeed 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.950
 when you put them on you look like you have a 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.690
 but red barracks are very comfortable 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.879
 I tell you because I have already tried them in 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.909
 that this post-testing boxing 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.190
 that I won't show you anyway you know 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:20.769
 just that the microphone with you 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.129
 no one here and you can see the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.010
 clearness 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.590
 yes because in my voice compared to 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.340
 previous microphone as you see 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.710
 microphone with status LED inside and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.770
 outside we have 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.400
 that part is a matter of noise 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:45.140
 external underlying fears we say the 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.880
 headphones are very soft and very comfortable 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.560
 they fit perfectly to the ear 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 as we can see they also have a 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.690
 superior padding that makes a lot 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.570
 comfortable to wear them even for several hours 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.940
 I kept them one day I did 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.970
 four consecutive hours of gaming 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.950
 the battery lasts quite well let's say 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.710
 that on the six bars seven hours of play 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.410
 consecutive and upload as you upload 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.260
 dual shocks directly as you see from 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.180
 this brings you the usual cable here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.950
 which is not included in the package but at a 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.650
 cable if you have joined the know that ce 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.210
 you will surely have a microphone 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.860
 removable so that it cannot be closed again 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.870
 use it you keep the button of 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.960
 ignition here we say it is a fake 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.700
 button if you hold it down turn on 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.340
 turn off if you simply press it 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.800
 exclude the microphone and the status led 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.220
 it changes color because it is normally blue 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.840
 when it is active and therefore 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.880
 you can use the microphone 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.370
 if you press, it turns into a microphone microphone 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.560
 excluded when you put it in charge but 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.510
 use it the same it turns red for 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.610
 report that in office 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.380
 moreover all the controls are present 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.630
 directly on the headset as you see 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.020
 here we try to show you 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.639
 we have a level between voice and sound 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.220
 what good is it if we want to have 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.229
 this plate is all about sound not 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.330
 you will hear the voices more 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.800
 I hypothesize about cod because it is still fair 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.530
 gaming that we use will satisfy everything 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.970
 above all and therefore you will only hear 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.810
 the noises played as the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.400
 we approach a voice will be excluded 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.169
 instead the sound and hear only the voices 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.330
 so we have to find the level is not 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.400
 more comfortable, however, there is a 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.830
 you have heard the click when it is 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.479
 perfectly halves it hangs by itself 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.760
 in such a way however that it can 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.889
 set for good and having means 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.960
 intermediate instead we have later 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.570
 the master valium control 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.280
 the general volume simply raises it 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.860
 thesis others in the name of everything they are 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.199
 rumor that both are lowered to 0 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.810
 completely change the sound then 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.370
 since there are other pairs of 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:54.090
 minutes for example the most classic 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:58.030
 corsair or other brands that have the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.580
 separate controller on the cable there 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.250
 allows you to exclude item or select 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.260
 better are anything else and here instead 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.880
 we need a little attitude with these 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.220
 tactics these levels to find 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.960
 there is this brilliant music genre 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.229
 here is a little what I am 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:19.120
 quivering now that it activates or deactivates 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:23.460
 the virtual surround on the pc the virtual 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.930
 surround is not usable but let's say 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.060
 they are mostly as you have seen 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.250
 anyway for those who play ps3 so if 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.990
 you want gaming headset for pc games 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.310
 and you want the right to both 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.229
 oriental of on something else 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.860
 a positive thing for the price 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.710
 relatively low they have 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.979
 because maybe in audio quality level 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.860
 on a par with the audio technician you should 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:48.199
 take headphones from 150 to 200 euros 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.789
 these with 90 euros of damage a very good 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.729
 audio on console 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:55.039
 I repeat it is mostly wireless and 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.120
 so that's the big advantage then 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.949
 can also be used for 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.830
 record as I do 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.120
 but I repeat for PC gaming vi 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.150
 advice becoming of something else 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.669
 if you want a game hub back to his 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.219
 ban customers as a stereo headset made 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:13.340
 of good well guys that then this you 

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:15.080
 remember that your computer and repair from 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.750
 little time by the way and indeed I think that 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.479
 at least a week will stay away as soon as I do 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.039
 they will let me know the extent of the damage me 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.120
 they will also tell you how long it will take for 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.370
 repair 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.870
 in the meantime I cannot guarantee success 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.520
 of videos of miseries 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.069
 I will try to give as much material as possible 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.600
 possible to sharp especially I will try 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:36.490
 to treat me alternative computer 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.500
 in short, I leave you to the shock series 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.220
 that will come out regularly in this 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.020
 time 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.580
 I hope you enjoyed the boxing there 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.840
 was helpful in considering 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.820
 buying these headphones 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.770
 you have to get used to playing on why 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.080
 if like me you never did it because 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.810
 I have to say a whole other world 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.980
 but it is a purchase that I deserve 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.850
 honestly I was very much 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.560
 satisfied 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.300
 so nothing your sponsor 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.620
 greets thanks for your attention and vi 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.620
 I refer to the next video bye
