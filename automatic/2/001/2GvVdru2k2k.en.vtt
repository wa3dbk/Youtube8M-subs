past<00:01:03.510> about<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.439> lefty<00:01:04.920> design<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.299> at

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
past about the lefty design they look at

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.359 
past about the lefty design they look at
it<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.689> say<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.470> only<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.920> leg<00:01:08.159> how

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it and they say there's only one leg how

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.950 
it and they say there's only one leg how
can<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:09.030> strong<00:01:09.360> enough<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.659> me

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can that really be strong enough for me

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.890 
can that really be strong enough for me
what<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> say<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:11.790> actually<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what do you say it's actually the the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
what do you say it's actually the the
lightest<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.619> stiffest<00:01:14.040> platform<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.850> the

lightest and stiffest platform on the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.429 
lightest and stiffest platform on the
planet<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> super<00:01:15.930> strong<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
planet and it's super strong it's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
planet and it's super strong it's
actually<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> square<00:01:17.159> stanchion<00:01:17.700> inside<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
actually a square stanchion inside of a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.570 
actually a square stanchion inside of a
inside<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> square<00:01:19.350> tube<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.400> no

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
inside of a square tube so there's no

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
inside of a square tube so there's no
there's<00:01:20.970> no<00:01:21.049> what<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.229> call<00:01:22.409> stiction<00:01:22.950> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
there's no what we call stiction so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
there's no what we call stiction so
there's<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.580> twisting<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.689> also

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there's no twisting and you will also

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
there's no twisting and you will also
get<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> 12<00:01:25.650> millimeters<00:01:26.369> thru<00:01:26.610> axle<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:27.180> at

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
get a 12 millimeters thru axle down at

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
get a 12 millimeters thru axle down at
the<00:01:27.390> hub<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.840> instead<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.290> spindly<00:01:28.619> little

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the hub so instead of a spindly little

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
the hub so instead of a spindly little
quick<00:01:29.430> release<00:01:29.729> you've<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.150> quite<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> bit<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
quick release you've got quite a bit of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
quick release you've got quite a bit of
stiffness<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> strength<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.520> plus<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
stiffness and strength down there plus I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
stiffness and strength down there plus I
mean<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.439> guess<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> most<00:01:35.280> obvious<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> can

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mean I guess the most obvious way I can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
mean I guess the most obvious way I can
put<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:36.990> how<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> mount<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
put it is think about how you mount the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
put it is think about how you mount the
wheels<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.790> car<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
wheels to your car it's pretty much the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.270 
wheels to your car it's pretty much the
same<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.650> makes<00:01:40.890> sense<00:01:41.130> because

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
same thing that makes sense because

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
actually better that way right but it's

truck<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.049> mean<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.859> would<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.400> air<00:03:21.699> there<00:03:22.030> was

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
truck I mean it would like air there was

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.270 
truck I mean it would like air there was
nothing<00:03:22.480> there<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:23.349> one's<00:03:23.560> actually<00:03:23.769> at<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
nothing there this one's actually at the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.460 
nothing there this one's actually at the
UCI<00:03:24.609> limits<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.299> at<00:03:25.480> 15<00:03:25.870> pounds<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.440> a

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
UCI limits so it's at 15 pounds and a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.050 
UCI limits so it's at 15 pounds and a
lot<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.829> has<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.220> with<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.519> LCA<00:03:28.000> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
lot of that has to do with the LCA of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.780 
lot of that has to do with the LCA of
the<00:03:28.120> deep<00:03:28.269> dish<00:03:28.449> wheels<00:03:29.079> we've<00:03:29.379> got<00:03:29.530> on<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.829> but

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the deep dish wheels we've got on it but

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.509 
the deep dish wheels we've got on it but
we<00:03:31.629> did<00:03:31.900> in<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.199> tour<00:03:32.620> California<00:03:33.220> have<00:03:33.370> to

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
we did in the tour California have to

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.780 
we did in the tour California have to
add<00:03:33.639> weight<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.560> Yvonne<00:03:35.560> Bosco's<00:03:36.010> bike<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
add weight to the Yvonne Bosco's bike to

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.360 
add weight to the Yvonne Bosco's bike to
meet<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.599> UCI<00:03:37.840> limits<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.980> first<00:03:39.190> thing

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
meet the UCI limits the first thing

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.400 
meet the UCI limits the first thing
they'll<00:03:39.519> do<00:03:39.639> is<00:03:39.669> put<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> scale<00:03:40.410> now

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
they'll do is put it on a scale now

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.539 
they'll do is put it on a scale now
speaking<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.829> lightweight<00:03:42.129> let's<00:03:42.340> look<00:03:42.430> at

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
speaking of lightweight let's look at

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.250 
speaking of lightweight let's look at

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
this mountain bike over here we'll move

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.500 
this mountain bike over here we'll move
over<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:45.190> flash<00:03:45.549> tell<00:03:45.910> us<00:03:46.030> about<00:03:46.150> this

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
over to the flash tell us about this

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.500 
over to the flash tell us about this
bike<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.980> one<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:48.970> those<00:03:49.090> things<00:03:49.299> that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
bike this is one of those things that

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.420 
bike this is one of those things that
I'll<00:03:49.720> call<00:03:50.169> industry-changing<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.430> heart

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I'll call industry-changing it's a heart

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.899 
I'll call industry-changing it's a heart

ailment bike full carbon fiber but it's

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.849 
ailment bike full carbon fiber but it's

actually it only weighs 17 pounds which

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.129 
actually it only weighs 17 pounds which

the<00:04:02.230> planet<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:03.579> uses<00:04:04.269> what<00:04:04.510> we<00:04:04.599> call

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
the planet it uses what we call

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.399 
the planet it uses what we call
continuous<00:04:05.319> fiber<00:04:05.590> design<00:04:06.010> which<00:04:06.400> means

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
continuous fiber design which means

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.680 
continuous fiber design which means

it<00:04:14.470> is<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.739> lesson<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.190> have<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.489> use<00:04:15.669> on

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
it is the lesson that you have to use on

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.240 
it is the lesson that you have to use on
a<00:04:15.909> bike<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.419> this<00:04:17.380> has<00:04:17.560> continuous<00:04:18.039> fiber

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
a bike so this has continuous fiber

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.830 
a bike so this has continuous fiber
strands<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.880> lead<00:04:19.000> from<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.180> head<00:04:19.389> tube<00:04:19.599> all

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
strands the lead from the head tube all

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.009 
strands the lead from the head tube all
the<00:04:19.900> way<00:04:20.049> down<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.530> drop

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
the way down to the drop

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.439 
the way down to the drop
and<00:04:21.550> that's<00:04:22.550> what<00:04:22.699> gives<00:04:22.849> it<00:04:23.000> its<00:04:23.150> superior

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
and that's what gives it its superior

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.930 
and that's what gives it its superior
stiffness<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.259> obviously<00:04:24.940> super

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
stiffness and obviously super

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.480 
stiffness and obviously super
lightweight<00:04:26.680> now<00:04:27.680> would<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:27.979> say<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.190> this

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
lightweight now would you say that this

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.180 
lightweight now would you say that this

it's like riding a Super Six on dirt if
that<00:04:47.900> helps<00:04:48.139> describe<00:04:48.409> the<00:04:48.620> experience<00:04:48.710> but

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
that helps describe the experience but

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480 
that helps describe the experience but
it<00:04:49.430> is<00:04:49.550> it<00:04:49.879> is<00:04:50.090> an<00:04:50.240> explosive<00:04:50.960> explosive<00:04:51.500> super

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
it is it is an explosive explosive super

tell us about that yeah this this
actually<00:05:02.330> it's<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.289> lighter<00:05:03.500> way<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:04.550> lock

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
actually it's a lighter way to to lock

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.300 
actually it's a lighter way to to lock
out<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.360> travel<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.050> just<00:05:06.229> has<00:05:06.409> a<00:05:06.440> quick<00:05:06.889> flip

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
out the travel it just has a quick flip
