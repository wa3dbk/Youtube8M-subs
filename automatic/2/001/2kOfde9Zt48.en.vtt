00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
better utilized they're not where they

some<00:02:20.220> kind<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.490> way<00:02:21.920> yeah<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.730> data

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
some kind of way yeah and so this data

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.570 
some kind of way yeah and so this data
focused<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:24.930> cities<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.920> larger

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
focused on cities not larger

metropolitan<00:02:27.020> areas<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:29.130> could<00:02:29.430> have

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
metropolitan areas and that could have

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.030 
metropolitan areas and that could have
an<00:02:29.880> impact<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.630> could<00:02:30.810> put<00:02:31.050> older<00:02:31.710> cities

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
an impact and could put older cities

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
an impact and could put older cities
like<00:02:32.220> Buffalo<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.970> disadvantage<00:02:33.840> when<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
