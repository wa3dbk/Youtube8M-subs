 It is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.210
 Hey Well, now it is an old visual system likely 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.440
 It may be said that it is said that it is a bit old in Japan. 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.150
 Also I do not know 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.150

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.420
 It's not a band 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 To come sultry sound to such a strange-looking rather than let this kind of stage 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.660
 It is half and half the band 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.730
