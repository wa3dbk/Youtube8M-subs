00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 two 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 he has brought me home 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.270
 a group of hamsters and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.100
 how to prepare them the ideal cage the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.140
 true that hamsters need 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 spaces more or less reduced and only 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.270
 you are going to have one with one more cage or 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 less than 30 x 20 is enough but to me 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.230
 I love them and I've brought a lot 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 so I 'm going to prepare a super 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 two-story mansion so they are very 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.199
 at ease and here you have it, you will see 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.479
 I have put with hay in all 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.309
 lagomorphs and rodents always 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.989
 always the first days in the cage a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 hay pile so they can 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 shelter and look for places more 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 calm because they are very animal 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 susceptible to stress 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.000
 Well, I have a jaulita and I already 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.950
 I have put in or in and now 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.530
 want you to see other things that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.240
 let's also put the feed 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 obviously a hamster feed that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'm going to put it a little in the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 second floor 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 simply because these first days 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.520
 access to food has to be very 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.150
 simple then almost that I'm going to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.130
 put food everywhere 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.190
 because they have to be very 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.200
 easy to find food wherever they are 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.080
 so I'm going to spread it a little bit 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.910
 all sides even though after your site 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.140
 normal food is going to be nothing more than 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:39.170
 the second floor the super important hay 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.580
 let's put a little more for us 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.490
 to do two functions one to save 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.040
 shelter and two also do the function 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.140
 of food we will put there under the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.690
 staircase to me I always like to put 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.710
 several types so that they eat the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.710
 what do you like most? 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.579
 perfect 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.159
 fine and the hamster 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.880
 there is an important thing also for your 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.030
 shelter that is a substrate or bed that is 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.209
 called sweet dreams and there are two types 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.489
 different ones that you can use well in 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.830
 cellulose form that they are going to finish 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.890
 hearing and making their nest or in 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.260
 cotton way let's put the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.780
 sweet dreams of cellulose under the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.440
 staircase is the place where I want that 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.610
 make your nest and have your bed 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.800
 - perfect 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.190
 Well, hamsters should also take 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.320
 some eye vegetable with fruit fruit 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.600
 not too much but green leafy vegetables 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.070
 yes that you can put them on a daily basis 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.190
 I'm also going to give you a little 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.360
 because I have a lot of them 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.880
 and I know that they also like a lot 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.340
 perfect that I have left of course 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.520
 if talking about the heat the first days in 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.040
 house have that the environment be between 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.920
 25 and 27 degrees especially because in addition 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.530
 Now they are puppies and we have separated them 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.080
 of the mother and others whenever you can 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.660
 have several much better hamsters 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.100
 among them they get along quite well 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.350
 provided they have been raised from 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.660
 small but it is true that the males 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.970
 they get very bad and they accept very badly 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.470
 another male that comes in again therefore 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.350
 try if you have several to make a 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.140
 small group of females and how much to have a 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.580
 male be very careful because if 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.470
 you have males and females together you go to 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.910
 make an empire of hamsters right away 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.910
 because they are animals with a capacity of 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.450
 reproduce exaggerated 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.450
 4 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.480
 simply that you have them calm 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.189
 leave them alone in the first 23 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.530
 days I also know that they come home and 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.299
 you're looking forward to catching them and so on 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.859
 nothing to leave them in the Saudi that is 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.079
 adapt there well at least two three 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.790
 four days to a week also the 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.890
 snacks that will quickly bring you up like 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.510
 chuches nurseries there are many of them 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.129
 in the market do not use them jce al 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.200
 principle because they like many 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.790
 They are binging and they are not going well 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 I hope so much that you have learned 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.539
 mogollÃ³n with this that you have loved 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.160
 They are precious to me hamsters 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.959
 I particularly like them a lot and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.289
 they're going to take no time at all 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.289
 baby
