00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.140 
specifically this vehicle this bike
speeder<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.650> land<00:02:19.280> speeder<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.060> do

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
speeder and this land speeder what do

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150 
speeder and this land speeder what do
you<00:02:20.240> think<00:02:20.510> guys<00:02:20.660> let's<00:02:21.110> compare<00:02:21.620> all<00:02:21.830> three

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160

together<00:02:22.600> now<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.630> definitely<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:24.380> that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
together now I definitely think that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.190 
together now I definitely think that
there's<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> Star<00:02:25.460> Wars<00:02:25.490> vibe<00:02:26.150> about<00:02:26.750> this

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
there's like a Star Wars vibe about this

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.930 
there's like a Star Wars vibe about this
Pike<00:02:27.500> land<00:02:28.070> speeder<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.640> wouldn't<00:02:28.880> be

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
Pike land speeder and I wouldn't be

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
surprised if firm these two vehicles

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.420 
surprised if firm these two vehicles
were<00:02:32.480> an<00:02:32.690> inspiration<00:02:32.990> for<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.890> leave<00:02:34.400> a
