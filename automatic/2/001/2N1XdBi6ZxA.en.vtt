00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
noctua NF NFS 14b fan basically it's a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.250 
noctua NF NFS 14b fan basically it's a
12<00:00:46.140> centimeter<00:00:46.530> fan<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.430> 120<00:00:48.090> millimeter<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
12 centimeter fan or 120 millimeter you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
12 centimeter fan or 120 millimeter you
can<00:00:49.379> put<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.890> any<00:00:50.070> case<00:00:50.399> fan<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
can put this in any case fan that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.450 
can put this in any case fan that
supports<00:00:51.239> 120<00:00:51.809> millimeters<00:00:52.230> we'll<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.219> taking

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
supports 120 millimeters we'll be taking

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
supports 120 millimeters we'll be taking
a<00:00:53.489> quick<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.230> more

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
a quick look at this would be a lot more

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
a quick look at this would be a lot more
depth<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.610> full<00:00:56.969> review<00:00:57.149> about

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
depth when we do our full review about

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
depth when we do our full review about
it<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.739> quick<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.250> over<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it so this is just a quick look over and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.869 
it so this is just a quick look over and
basically<00:01:00.809> when<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.079> comes<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> box

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
basically when it comes with the box

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.219 
basically when it comes with the box
opening<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> package<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.780> find<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
opening up the package here we find a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.109 
opening up the package here we find a
fan<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:05.280> find<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:06.799> adapters<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:09.000> have

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
fan we find some adapters and we have

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
fan we find some adapters and we have
some<00:01:09.770> basically<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.979> rubber<00:01:11.280> mounts<00:01:11.700> for

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
some basically some rubber mounts for

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
some basically some rubber mounts for
ooh<00:01:12.390> drop<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.619> grab<00:01:13.740> another<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
ooh drop one let's grab another one we

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
ooh drop one let's grab another one we
have<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> rubber<00:01:15.180> mount<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.810> being<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.799> lists

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
have a rubber mount for being two lists

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.740 
have a rubber mount for being two lists
and<00:01:17.280> also<00:01:17.580> anti-vibration<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.509> mounting

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and also anti-vibration for mounting

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
and also anti-vibration for mounting
your<00:01:18.780> fan<00:01:19.040> those<00:01:20.040> actually<00:01:20.280> work<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.430> well

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
your fan those actually work really well

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
your fan those actually work really well
I've<00:01:20.939> used<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> past<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.900> like

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
I've used them the past I really like

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.499 
I've used them the past I really like
them<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.799> moving<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> fan<00:01:23.640> basically

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
them now moving on to the fan basically

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
them now moving on to the fan basically
the<00:01:24.600> fan<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> very<00:01:26.100> weird<00:01:26.610> style<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the fan is has a very weird style of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.429 
the fan is has a very weird style of
blade<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:27.990> from<00:01:28.049> anything<00:01:28.259> I've

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
blade very different from anything I've

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
blade very different from anything I've
ever<00:01:28.470> seen<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.280> actually<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.820> reduce

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ever seen but it's actually to reduce

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.780 
ever seen but it's actually to reduce
noise<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.740> increase<00:01:31.740> airflow<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.340> low<00:01:32.579> noise

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
noise and increase airflow at low noise

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.039 
noise and increase airflow at low noise
because<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.590> high<00:01:35.659> angle<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
because it has a very high angle on the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
because it has a very high angle on the
fan<00:01:37.259> blade<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.829> cut<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> air<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
fan blade to really cut in the air it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.359 
fan blade to really cut in the air it
has<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.240> notched<00:01:40.049> blades<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> end<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
has these notched blades on the end that

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.429 
has these notched blades on the end that
really<00:01:41.670> uses<00:01:42.000> noise<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> helps<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
really uses noise as well and helps with

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.789 
really uses noise as well and helps with
the<00:01:43.549> airflow<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.579> things<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
the airflow and things like that and

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
the airflow and things like that and
will<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.280> show<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> all

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
will we will show you how much that all

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
will we will show you how much that all
this<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> real<00:01:50.159> work<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:51.000> into

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this all this real work they put into

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.210 
this all this real work they put into
making<00:01:51.329> its<00:01:51.630> unique<00:01:52.110> fan<00:01:52.409> design<00:01:52.590> actually

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
making its unique fan design actually

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.450 
making its unique fan design actually
works<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> also<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.250> comes<00:01:56.340> with

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
works really well so also it comes with

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
works really well so also it comes with
a<00:01:57.110> sleeved<00:01:58.110> cable<00:01:58.710> which<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> black<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.610> like

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a sleeved cable which is a black as like

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.100 
a sleeved cable which is a black as like
a<00:01:59.790> black<00:02:00.000> rubber<00:02:00.210> finish<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.990> it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
a black rubber finish to it and it's

is how you break it down from 1,200 to
900<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.550> 600<00:02:16.000> rpm<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.080> low<00:02:17.470> noise

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
900 to 600 rpm so we have the low noise

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.780 
900 to 600 rpm so we have the low noise
adapter<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.190> ultraoids<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
adapter and the ultraoids in the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.360 
adapter and the ultraoids in the
ultra-low<00:02:19.360> noise<00:02:19.390> adapter<00:02:19.990> we<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.100> have
