sometimes<00:00:00.810> people<00:00:01.170> think<00:00:01.350> that<00:00:01.589> emotion<00:00:02.959> and

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
sometimes people think that emotion and

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.390 
sometimes people think that emotion and
art<00:00:04.680> are<00:00:05.160> sideshows<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.569> human<00:00:06.810> intelligence

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
art are sideshows to human intelligence

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.980 
art are sideshows to human intelligence
the<00:00:08.400> real<00:00:08.639> essence<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.210> intelligence<00:00:09.750> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the real essence of intelligence is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.870 
the real essence of intelligence is
thinking<00:00:10.410> logically<00:00:10.860> if<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.580> were<00:00:11.700> true

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
thinking logically if that were true

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.730 
thinking logically if that were true
computers<00:00:12.450> already<00:00:12.660> smarter<00:00:13.469> than<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.710> are

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
computers already smarter than we are

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.560 
computers already smarter than we are
because<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.460> much<00:00:14.580> better<00:00:14.849> at<00:00:15.089> logical

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
because it's so much better at logical

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.750 
because it's so much better at logical
thinking<00:00:15.870> than<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.230> are

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
thinking than we are

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.439 
thinking than we are
it's<00:00:18.210> actually<00:00:18.690> things<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.350> being<00:00:19.590> funny

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
it's actually things like being funny

it's actually things like being funny
being<00:00:21.449> sexy<00:00:22.380> or<00:00:22.740> expressing<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> loving

being sexy or expressing a loving

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.420 
being sexy or expressing a loving
sentiment<00:00:24.449> maybe<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> poem<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.369> a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sentiment maybe in a poem or in a

sentiment maybe in a poem or in a
musical<00:00:26.939> piece<00:00:27.470> that's<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.710> cutting<00:00:29.010> edge

eternium and intelligence has to do with

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
at a high level it's dealing with

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
at a high level it's dealing with
concepts<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.750> beauty<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.770> poem<00:00:49.980> by

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
a poem like that and you can come back

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
a poem like that and you can come back
to<00:00:54.329> creativity<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.989> believe<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.500> an<00:00:55.649> exercise

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to creativity I believe it's an exercise

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.299 
to creativity I believe it's an exercise
in<00:00:56.239> in<00:00:57.239> metaphors<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> neocortex<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
in in metaphors and the neocortex is a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
in in metaphors and the neocortex is a
metaphor<00:00:59.969> machine<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.079> good

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
metaphor machine that's what it's good

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.820 
metaphor machine that's what it's good
at<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:02.640> humans<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.300> creative<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.710> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
at that's why humans are creative but we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820 
at that's why humans are creative but we
have<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.519> large<00:01:06.380> hierarchy<00:01:07.380> where<00:01:07.680> we

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
have this very large hierarchy where we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.960 
have this very large hierarchy where we
have<00:01:07.979> more<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:08.939> abstract<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.049> complex

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
have more and more abstract and complex

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
have more and more abstract and complex
patterns<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.960> builds<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.500> patterns

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
patterns you know builds on patterns

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
humans and say other primates is that we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
humans and say other primates is that we
have<00:01:19.950> more<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> neocortex<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
have more of the neocortex we have this

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
have more of the neocortex we have this
big<00:01:22.259> forehead<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.189> could<00:01:23.369> fit<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
big forehead that we could fit in the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
big forehead that we could fit in the
frontal<00:01:24.270> cortex<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.840> therefore<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
frontal cortex and therefore have a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.940 
frontal cortex and therefore have a
higher<00:01:26.220> number<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:27.140> hierarchies<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.560> levels

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
higher number of hierarchies of levels

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
higher number of hierarchies of levels
of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> hierarchy<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
of the hierarchy and that was the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
of the hierarchy and that was the
enabling<00:01:31.350> factor<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.189> permitted<00:01:33.060> the

enabling factor that that permitted the

enabling factor that that permitted the
evolution<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.079> language<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.950> technology<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
evolution of language and technology and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.590 
principles I'm actually working on that
and<00:01:45.470> we've<00:01:46.470> had<00:01:46.970> hierarchical<00:01:47.970> systems<00:01:48.420> like

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and we've had hierarchical systems like

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.859 
and we've had hierarchical systems like
that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.840> helped<00:01:49.409> pioneer<00:01:50.659> concept<00:01:51.659> called

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that I helped pioneer concept called

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
that I helped pioneer concept called
hierarchical<00:01:52.470> hidden<00:01:52.680> Markov<00:01:53.220> models<00:01:53.610> it's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
hierarchical hidden Markov models it's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609 
hierarchical hidden Markov models it's
similar<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.540> happens<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> brain<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
similar to what happens in the brain but

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.480 
similar to what happens in the brain but
we<00:01:55.680> only<00:01:56.490> had<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> few<00:01:57.060> levels<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.770> brain<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.460> a
