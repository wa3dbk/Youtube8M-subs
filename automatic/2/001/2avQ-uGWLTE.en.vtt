00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is right here see if i can get my big

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
is right here see if i can get my big
little<00:01:28.439> fingers<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.579> here

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
little fingers out of it right here

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.510 
little fingers out of it right here
there's<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.210> sticks<00:01:30.860> i'm<00:01:31.860> sure<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.189> hit<00:01:32.369> this

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
there's two sticks i'm sure we hit this

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.190 
there's two sticks i'm sure we hit this
power<00:01:32.850> cord<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.569 

so<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.469> a<00:01:40.590> clear<00:01:40.920> view<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.369> ramp

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so now you have a clear view of the ramp

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
so now you have a clear view of the ramp
and<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.619> much

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and so what you do is pretty much

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.919 
and so what you do is pretty much
universal<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.759> machine<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.570> there's<00:01:45.810> two

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
universal for any machine is there's two

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.139 
universal for any machine is there's two
little<00:01:46.049> tabs<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> each<00:01:46.859> stick<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:48.000> just

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
little tabs here on each stick you just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
little tabs here on each stick you just
push<00:01:48.359> both<00:01:48.539> those<00:01:48.780> down<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> RAM<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:49.679> pop

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
push both those down in the RAM will pop

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.029 
push both those down in the RAM will pop
up<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> 512

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
up you can see here this is a 512

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.010 
up you can see here this is a 512
megabyte<00:01:56.429> stick<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.420> does<00:01:57.600> suck<00:01:57.869> with

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
megabyte stick and it does suck with

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.149 
megabyte stick and it does suck with
this<00:01:58.110> computer<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:58.679> i<00:01:58.709> only<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.009> two

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this computer because i only have two

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.340 
this computer because i only have two
ram<00:01:59.399> slots<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.719> won't<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.109> able<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.319> use

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
ram slots so i won't be able to use

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.599 
ram slots so i won't be able to use
these<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.829> i'm<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> give<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.490> my
