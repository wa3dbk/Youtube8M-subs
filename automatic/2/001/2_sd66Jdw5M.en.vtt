doesn't<00:01:09.600> work

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.219 

and<00:01:15.189> our<00:01:16.119> first<00:01:16.600> line<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
and our first line is really in the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.649 
and our first line is really in the
between<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.740> lashes<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.430> give<00:01:21.939> depth<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
between the lashes to give depth to the

then<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.340> back<00:01:32.370> and<00:01:32.580> layer<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.000> top<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
then we can go back and layer on top of
