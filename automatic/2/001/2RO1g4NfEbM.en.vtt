00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
wanted to go in more detail why we

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.140 
wanted to go in more detail why we
should<00:03:30.919> I<00:03:31.069> would<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.639> see<00:03:31.819> them<00:03:31.970> as<00:03:32.090> you

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
should I would like to see them as you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.030 
should I would like to see them as you
can<00:03:32.180> see<00:03:32.389> this<00:03:32.479> is<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.659> modern<00:03:32.900> map<00:03:33.199> I'm<00:03:33.829> trying

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
can see this is a modern map I'm trying

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.319 
can see this is a modern map I'm trying
to<00:03:34.099> figure<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.400> where<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.699> commands<00:03:35.209> are

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
to figure out where the commands are

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.240 
to figure out where the commands are
that<00:03:35.629> I<00:03:35.659> think<00:03:35.900> they<00:03:35.989> are<00:03:36.109> down<00:03:36.349> here<00:03:36.769> let's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
that I think they are down here let's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.420 
that I think they are down here let's
have<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.430> look<00:03:37.609> no<00:03:38.620> yes<00:03:39.620> there<00:03:39.799> we<00:03:39.919> go<00:03:40.069> there's

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
have a look no yes there we go there's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.740 
have a look no yes there we go there's
the<00:03:40.489> command<00:03:40.819> block<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.000> as<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.329> can<00:03:41.479> see

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
the command block and as you can see

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.599 
the command block and as you can see
there<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.409> command<00:03:42.769> block<00:03:42.949> is<00:03:43.099> actually

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
there the command block is actually

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.330 
there the command block is actually
block<00:03:43.970> on<00:03:44.150> minecraft<00:03:44.870> Xbox<00:03:45.409> 360<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.099> it's<00:03:46.250> in

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
block on minecraft Xbox 360 and it's in

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.949 
block on minecraft Xbox 360 and it's in
the<00:03:46.430> source<00:03:46.639> coding<00:03:46.909> for<00:03:47.239> all<00:03:47.389> versions<00:03:47.629> of

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
the source coding for all versions of

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.339 
the source coding for all versions of
Minecraft<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.889> can<00:03:49.609> place<00:03:49.849> them<00:03:50.229> as<00:03:51.229> you

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
Minecraft and you can place them as you

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.929 
Minecraft and you can place them as you
can<00:03:51.500> see<00:03:51.680> their<00:03:51.859> command<00:03:52.220> block<00:03:52.400> used<00:03:52.790> to

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
can see their command block used to

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.270 
can see their command block used to
execute<00:03:53.299> commands<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.500> command<00:03:54.859> block<00:03:55.069> is

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
execute commands so the command block is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.069 
execute commands so the command block is
in<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.609> game<00:03:55.849> so<00:03:56.209> why<00:03:56.389> is<00:03:56.449> it<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.930> game

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
in the game so why is it in the game

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.409 
in the game so why is it in the game
that<00:03:57.349> is<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.620> big<00:03:57.829> question<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.609> I<00:03:59.120> want<00:03:59.359> to

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
the future because it's not like a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.059 
the future because it's not like a
modded<00:04:10.669> block<00:04:10.939> although<00:04:11.299> it's<00:04:11.449> modded<00:04:11.840> on

modded block although it's modded on
minecraft<00:04:13.069> Xbox<00:04:13.489> 360<00:04:13.909> because<00:04:14.060> they're

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
place anything on top of them meaning

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.060 
place anything on top of them meaning
that<00:04:20.299> something's<00:04:20.989> blocking<00:04:21.199> it<00:04:21.469> I<00:04:21.680> feel<00:04:21.919> like

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
that something's blocking it I feel like

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.370 
that something's blocking it I feel like
that<00:04:22.310> they<00:04:22.639> need<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.849> be<00:04:23.060> accessible<00:04:23.599> and<00:04:23.900> they

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that they need to be accessible and they

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.860 
that they need to be accessible and they
should<00:04:24.620> be<00:04:24.740> accessed<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.669> future

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
should be accessed in the future

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.510 
should be accessed in the future
I<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.380> feel<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:27.620> they<00:04:27.740> will<00:04:27.919> be<00:04:27.980> accessed

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
I just feel like they will be accessed

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.430 
I just feel like they will be accessed
in<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.730> future<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.480> hard<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.930> explain

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
in the future it's so hard to explain

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.250 
in the future it's so hard to explain
what<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:30.889> mean<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.510> just<00:04:32.780> think<00:04:32.930> man

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
what I mean and and I just think man

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.900 
what I mean and and I just think man
