00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:26.440
 Rocky Point Park was a highly popular theme park on the Narragansett Bay side of Warwick, Rhode Island, USA

 In the early 1990s, Rocky Point's financial situation became shaky. The park's private company lost money because it tried to keep the park up to date.

 It was closed in 1995.

 Rides like the Flume and Corkscrew were sold at auction and are currently being used at other fun parks.

 This briefly reopened in 1996 as a goodbye to accusers.
