which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> mistake<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> people<00:00:40.710> do

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
which is a mistake a lot of people do

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
which is a mistake a lot of people do
when<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:41.610> start<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.270> saw<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> whole

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
when they first start they saw the whole

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
when they first start they saw the whole
track<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:44.309> end<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.550> with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
track it's and then they end up with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.470 
track it's and then they end up with
five<00:00:45.420> hundred<00:00:45.840> lettuce<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> seed<00:00:51.090> will

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
five hundred lettuce and the seed will

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.380 
five hundred lettuce and the seed will
stay<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.170> these<00:00:52.350> compartments<00:00:53.270> until<00:00:54.270> it's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
stay in these compartments until it's
