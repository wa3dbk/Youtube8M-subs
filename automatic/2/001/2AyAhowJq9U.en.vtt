hojojutsu manual so here we go it's just
some<00:00:40.739> basic<00:00:41.489> knots<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.860> got<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.210> 7<00:00:45.210> inch

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
some basic knots I got about a 7 inch

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
some basic knots I got about a 7 inch
piece<00:00:46.469> that's<00:00:46.829> been<00:00:46.980> folded<00:00:47.399> over<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
piece that's been folded over and what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.950 
piece that's been folded over and what
you're<00:00:49.649> gonna<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:50.600> is<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you're gonna do is you're going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
you're gonna do is you're going to
double<00:00:52.320> everything<00:00:52.620> over

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.470 

and<00:00:57.360> slide<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.900> in

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.230 

try<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:02.260> keep<00:01:02.380> everything

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.740 

as<00:01:08.360> neat<00:01:09.200> as<00:01:09.350> possible

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.570 

all<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.500> cords<00:01:14.860> laying<00:01:15.100> in<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.370> same

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
all the cords laying in the same

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.950 
all the cords laying in the same
direction

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.399 

you<00:01:20.530> got<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.760> then<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.900> do<00:01:22.960> another

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
you got one there and then I do another

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
you got one there and then I do another
one<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.460> center

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.910 

so<00:01:46.469> you<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:47.039> two<00:01:47.399> loops<00:01:48.920> inside

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
so you actually have two loops inside

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.760 
so you actually have two loops inside
there<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.429> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:51.500> from<00:01:52.500> what<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.679> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there and this is from what I can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.149 
there and this is from what I can
remember<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.219> manual<00:01:54.770> know<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:55.890> feeding

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
remember in that manual know by feeding

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
remember in that manual know by feeding
one<00:01:56.840> one<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.960> through<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.560> and<00:02:00.289> one<00:02:01.289> end

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
one one and through here and one end

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.469 
one one and through here and one end
through<00:02:01.590> there

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
through there

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.309 
through there
you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.810> use<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.709> form<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
you can actually use this as a form of I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.619 
you can actually use this as a form of I
guess<00:02:07.319> handcuff<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> pull<00:02:10.920> on

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
guess handcuff it's when you pull on

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.449 
guess handcuff it's when you pull on
this<00:02:12.629> rope<00:02:12.860> it'll<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:13.980> tighten

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
this rope it'll actually tighten

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
this rope it'll actually tighten
everything<00:02:14.549> up<00:02:17.900> can't<00:02:18.900> really<00:02:19.079> show<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.230> set

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
everything up can't really show you set

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.740 
everything up can't really show you set
on<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> other<00:02:19.769> set<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:19.980> hands<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:21.769> that's<00:02:22.769> the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
on the other set of hands but that's the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.479 
on the other set of hands but that's the
basic<00:02:24.750> end<00:02:26.569> it's<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.630> two<00:02:28.280> doubled<00:02:29.280> over

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
basic end it's just two doubled over

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.280 
basic end it's just two doubled over
knots<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:33.360> bundling<00:02:33.690> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
knots and then for bundling it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.949 
knots and then for bundling it
I<00:02:35.209> hold<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.329> one<00:02:36.540> knot<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.440> this

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.930 

you<00:02:43.409> want<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.799> bit<00:02:44.010> hang<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.640> hanging

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you want a little bit hang it hanging

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
you want a little bit hang it hanging
off<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.269> end<00:02:47.540> you're<00:02:48.540> gonna<00:02:48.599> keep<00:02:49.010> winding

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
off the end you're gonna keep winding

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
off the end you're gonna keep winding
this<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:52.310> until<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.640> got<00:02:53.819> I'll<00:02:54.599> maybe<00:02:54.870> about

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
this up until you got I'll maybe about

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.270 
this up until you got I'll maybe about
two<00:02:55.440> feet<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.739> cord<00:02:56.519> left<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.560> once<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.099> have

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
two feet of cord left and once you have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.539 
two feet of cord left and once you have
that<00:03:04.549> make<00:03:05.549> sure<00:03:05.730> everything<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:07.549> laying

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
that make sure everything is laying

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.240 
that make sure everything is laying
straight

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.809 

and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:15.880> start<00:03:16.270> winding

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.830 

your<00:03:21.450> cord<00:03:22.040> if<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:26.180> don't<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.269> enough<00:03:27.510> cord

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
your cord if you don't have enough cord

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.539 
your cord if you don't have enough cord
left<00:03:28.079> over<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.499> go<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:28.739> do<00:03:29.129> you<00:03:29.189> know<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> make

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
left over to go out do you know to make

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:36.429 
left over to go out do you know to make
it<00:03:29.579> nice<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:29.849> even<00:03:30.439> no<00:03:31.439> you<00:03:31.499> can<00:03:31.739> restart<00:03:32.189> it

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:44.119 

unwind<00:03:37.439> it<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.650> little<00:03:37.829> bit<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:40.909> then<00:03:43.129> restart

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
unwind it a little bit and then restart

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:55.990 
unwind it a little bit and then restart
it<00:03:44.219> a<00:03:44.310> little<00:03:44.489> bit<00:03:44.579> higher<00:03:44.760> if<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.030> want

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.420 

or<00:03:56.570> if<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.750> use<00:03:56.930> too<00:03:57.200> much<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.130> have<00:03:58.220> too

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
or if you use too much if you have too

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.540 
or if you use too much if you have too
much<00:03:58.520> left<00:03:58.760> over<00:03:59.770> you<00:04:00.770> know<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:00.920> can<00:04:01.160> make

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
much left over you know you can make

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.290 
much left over you know you can make
another<00:04:01.820> loop<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:03.640> then<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.760> finish<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.150> off

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
another loop and then to finish it off

say your you have got a hook or a weight
that<00:04:41.349> when<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.680> pull<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:47.169> it'll<00:04:47.860> start

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
that when you pull on it it it'll start

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.089 
that when you pull on it it it'll start
to<00:04:48.099> unravel<00:04:48.340> but<00:04:48.940> not<00:04:49.620> undo<00:04:50.620> your<00:04:50.740> binding

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
until you get towards the end it just

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.279 
until you get towards the end it just
comes<00:04:55.090> right<00:04:55.750> apart<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.229> it's<00:04:56.349> pretty<00:04:56.469> simple

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
comes right apart so it's pretty simple

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.649 
comes right apart so it's pretty simple
so<00:04:59.289> that's<00:04:59.469> your<00:04:59.620> basic<00:05:01.860> cord<00:05:02.860> knotting<00:05:03.099> and

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
so that's your basic cord knotting and

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.050 
so that's your basic cord knotting and
