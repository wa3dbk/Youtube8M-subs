they<00:00:46.840> didn't<00:00:47.840> run<00:00:48.020> mine<00:00:48.230> for<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.559> air<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.970> you

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
they didn't run mine for the air and you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.740 
they didn't run mine for the air and you
know<00:00:50.090> go<00:00:50.330> there<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:51.530> does<00:00:52.180> don't<00:00:53.180> perform<00:00:53.390> in

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
know go there it does don't perform in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.389 
know go there it does don't perform in
this<00:00:53.870> race<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.590> very<00:00:54.950> great<00:00:55.190> high

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
this race but it is a very great high

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.280 
this race but it is a very great high
risk<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.480> when<00:00:56.660> our<00:00:56.690> O'Connor<00:00:57.020> who<00:00:57.230> is

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
risk it is when our O'Connor who is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.540 
risk it is when our O'Connor who is
probably<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.620> leading<00:00:57.770> artichoke<00:00:58.220> look<00:00:58.340> very

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
probably the leading artichoke look very

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.520 
probably the leading artichoke look very
impressive<00:00:58.820> 21<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.780> spring<00:01:00.110> Chamberlain

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
impressive 21 the spring Chamberlain

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.260 
impressive 21 the spring Chamberlain
hurt<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.860> effort<00:01:01.100> sound<00:01:01.340> yeah<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> granite

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
hurt and effort sound yeah the granite

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.240 
hurt and effort sound yeah the granite
suppose<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.200> was<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.380> full<00:01:03.770> of<00:01:03.890> grounders<00:01:04.190> but

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
suppose it was a full of grounders but

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.650 
suppose it was a full of grounders but
they<00:01:04.460> would<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:04.699> had<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.059> far<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.540> air

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
they would have had so far to the air

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.460 
they would have had so far to the air
but<00:01:06.130> he<00:01:07.210> looks<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.390> be<00:01:08.479> firing<00:01:08.840> about<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.290> best

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
but he looks to be firing about the best

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.270 
but he looks to be firing about the best
