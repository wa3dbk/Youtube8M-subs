as much strength as possible for myself

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.110 
as much strength as possible for myself
as<00:00:52.800> well<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.460> trying<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:53.940> two

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
as well so I'm trying to those two

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
as well so I'm trying to those two
things<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.449> once<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.750> power<00:00:55.500> bodybuilding<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
things at once so power bodybuilding is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.229 
things at once so power bodybuilding is
kind<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.670> tiny<00:00:56.820> term<00:00:57.090> these

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
kind of like a little tiny term these

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
kind of like a little tiny term these
days<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:57.899> current<00:00:58.739> style<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
days it's really current style of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.049 
days it's really current style of
training<00:00:59.430> where<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.670> doing<00:00:59.789> two<00:01:00.030> things

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
training where you're doing two things

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.709 
training where you're doing two things
at<00:01:00.329> once

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
at once

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.810 
at once
so<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> training<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so the kind of training that I do is a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
so the kind of training that I do is a
separate<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> gym<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.080> example<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
separate to the gym for example on a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
separate to the gym for example on a
chest<00:01:04.830> day<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.220> I'll<00:01:05.309> warm<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:05.700> shoulders

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
chest day and I'll warm up my shoulders

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.570 
chest day and I'll warm up my shoulders
I<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.360> myself<00:01:06.479> probably<00:01:06.960> warmed<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
I get myself probably warmed up and the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
I get myself probably warmed up and the
first<00:01:08.820> exercise<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.900> bench<00:01:10.080> press

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
first exercise will be the bench press

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
first exercise will be the bench press
for<00:01:10.500> example<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> better<00:01:11.549> bench

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
for example I want to get a better bench

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.730 
for example I want to get a better bench
press<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.840> higher<00:01:13.110> number<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
press I want to get higher number and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120 
press I want to get higher number and
walk<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> 1<00:01:14.970> 2<00:01:15.299> 3<00:01:16.140> rep<00:01:16.350> max<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.920> most

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
walk up to like a 1 2 3 rep max and most

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
walk up to like a 1 2 3 rep max and most
of<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.400> I'm<00:01:17.610> normally<00:01:17.880> doing<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> 3<00:01:18.450> rep

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of time I'm normally doing like a 3 rep

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.380 
of time I'm normally doing like a 3 rep
max<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.200> normally<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.710> down<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> 1

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
max I'm not normally going down to a 1

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.850 
max I'm not normally going down to a 1
because<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> don't<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.560> compete

first exercise I spend 35 to maybe 40
minutes<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> exercise<00:01:46.710> alone<00:01:46.950> with

like that one

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.870 
like that one
separates<00:01:50.290> right<00:01:50.680> which<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.160> more<00:01:51.310> power<00:01:51.640> than

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
separates right which is more power than

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.790 
separates right which is more power than
style<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.540> following<00:01:53.350> exercises

trying to build the best physique
possible<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.610> get<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:06.910> much<00:02:07.119> light<00:02:07.330> as

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
possible and get as much light as

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.779 
possible and get as much light as
possible<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.020> way<00:02:08.110> I've<00:02:08.289> done<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.670> focus<00:02:09.670> on

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
possible the way I've done it focus on

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.250 
possible the way I've done it focus on
the<00:02:09.880> powerless<00:02:10.149> first<00:02:10.539> warming<00:02:11.050> out<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.230> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the powerless first warming out to a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
the powerless first warming out to a
heavier<00:02:11.560> weight<00:02:11.770> lower<00:02:12.430> red<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> then

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
heavier weight lower red and then

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.140 
heavier weight lower red and then
following<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.650> rest<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.040> workout<00:02:15.370> train

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
following the rest of that workout train

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.760 
following the rest of that workout train
more<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.480> positive<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.080> higher<00:02:17.290> volume

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
more like a positive so higher volume

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.520 
more like a positive so higher volume
less<00:02:18.340> weight<00:02:18.610> more<00:02:18.940> reps<00:02:19.180> more<00:02:19.510> squeeze<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
less weight more reps more squeeze and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.710 
less weight more reps more squeeze and
and<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.520> focus<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:21.940> any<00:02:22.060> blood<00:02:22.239> for<00:02:22.450> muscle

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and really focus on any blood for muscle

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.000 
and really focus on any blood for muscle
for<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.870> rest<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.380> workout<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.860> that's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
