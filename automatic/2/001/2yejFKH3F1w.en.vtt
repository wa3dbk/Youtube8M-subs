00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.430
 hello friends and welcome to this kitchen 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.890
 let's make a servo call recipe 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.540
 well because it's very simple very very 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 practice I am convinced and with you 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.800
 you are going to repeat it look puff 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.270
 frozen let's leave some minutillos 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.270
 so that they thaw 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.120
 well we have it ready we are going to put 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 a little bit of flour has to be treated 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 with a huge affection to the puff pastry because 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.520
 It is very very sensitive 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.820
 pay attention to what a sweetness I am 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.650
 opening because if we part then the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 cookies are not going to go wrong in Pongo 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.730
 more flour because this to the big ones of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 it comes very well I insist I speak with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.170
 very careful because if from part of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.240
 the good cookies the hand come out of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.740
 that way I keep putting flour 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.230
 that for the roller that I put it 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.910
 it was 12 mp because he passed the roller because 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 I want to stretch it I want a mass of one 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.229
 height a little bit more than a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.330
 millimeter also if it were here 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 There are only envies, I have the perfect 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.660
 great dough and now I put sugar 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.979
 You see why because the mass of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.540
 puff comes soda comes neutral 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 then with sugar they will be more 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.030
 rich that is this as you cutters you see 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.300
 that each has different forms and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.220
 you then I will use jce depending on a 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.050
 who is directed if it is for children and is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.940
 for larger parties if it is for the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.980
 what serves 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.290
 if I'm using it in flower form 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.900
 little heart of star 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.350
 what you want what I'm doing is 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.630
 good punching make the silhouette our 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.970
 cookie this card is going to have 22 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.340
 bits of these roles and we're going to put 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.440
 what I have done with a piece of paper 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.610
 edible ink marker and post 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.410
 here it is foolish to buy 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.930
 on a bicycle for the party of knowledge 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.300
 and them and this because you can not imagine that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.950
 lucky decree that super there are times 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 that the party is not the kids are 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.720
 of adults and this one that is going to 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.070
 touch you have to sing a ranchera 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.080
 I hope he knows how to sing because if we 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.630
 it will be a bit good to the east putting 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.600
 a little water on the street I said that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.960
 will go below I put the message then 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.380
 well now I take another equal but so that 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.710
 I put it on top and with the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.910
 video as it says it warns a little bit 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.560
 when squeezing good the cookie makes a 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.930
 biggest little will remove what 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.280
 over again with the same mold quito 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.080
 what we have left you know about that chin 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.490
 that you left trujillo and the cookie now 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.900
 we have again perfectly and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.239
 silhouetted 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.590
 closed on both sides and with its 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.140
 message well let's see another you see what 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.489
 I put the little message in the one below I close 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.200
 with the one on top I stamp with my finger 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.720
 I squeeze the tits is a little more 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 big to squeeze and what's left is what 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.030
 removed again with the mold cutter 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.579
 the strip was already there that good 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.549
 we have it here you have the cookie 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.560
 with the message inside very well as this 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.790
 the messages are made with ink 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.739
 edible that I said I did it with 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.659
 marker is very cheap but that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.670
 you can make five thousand messages that the 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.379
 hand if it's a little more expensive they sell 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.879
 printers with ink cartridges 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.099
 edible is to say that if you want to do 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.310
 parties or to arrange a factory 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.319
 granddaughter of fortune to do in order yo 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.819

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.040
 pretty nice for the holidays 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.299
 look at a baking tray that I put 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.859

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.780
 letizia do not hit us and we're going to 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.540
 put in the oven before we have to 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.549

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.379
 with egg that I'm really going to 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.590
