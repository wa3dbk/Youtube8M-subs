hey<00:00:00.390> guys<00:00:00.659> sh-t<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.829> today<00:00:02.429> I'm<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.939> be

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hey guys sh-t and today I'm gonna be

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.110 
hey guys sh-t and today I'm gonna be
talking<00:00:03.210> about<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:04.130> l85a2<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.970> the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
talking about the l85a2 with the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.440 
talking about the l85a2 with the
combination<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.379> prism<00:00:07.859> aside<00:00:08.210> this<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
combination of the prism aside this is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.180 
combination of the prism aside this is
one<00:00:09.660> very<00:00:09.929> interesting<00:00:10.559> article<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.040> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
one very interesting article that I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
one very interesting article that I
found<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.639> simply<00:00:12.000> calm<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.960> basically

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
found in simply calm so it basically

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980 
found in simply calm so it basically
talked<00:00:13.679> about<00:00:13.910> two<00:00:14.910> types<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.299> recoil<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
talked about two types of recoil in the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
talked about two types of recoil in the
battlefield<00:00:16.410> 4<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.160> guys<00:00:17.279> want<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
battlefield 4 and if you guys want to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.700 
battlefield 4 and if you guys want to
watch<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:18.060> video<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> recoil

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
watch my video about the recoil

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620 
watch my video about the recoil
mechanics<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.160> battlefield<00:00:20.640> 4<00:00:20.670> that's<00:00:21.090> where

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
mechanics in battlefield 4 that's where

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.929 
mechanics in battlefield 4 that's where
I<00:00:21.660> pretty<00:00:22.109> much<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:23.039> ideas<00:00:23.490> from<00:00:23.670> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
I pretty much got all my ideas from so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.189 
I pretty much got all my ideas from so
if<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> wanna<00:00:24.240> check<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.930> sure<00:00:24.990> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
if you wanna check it out be sure to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
if you wanna check it out be sure to
check<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.619> there's<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.580> many<00:00:26.699> things

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
check it out there's just so many things

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.490 
check it out there's just so many things
that<00:00:27.090> I'll<00:00:27.539> need<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> know<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.410> gonna

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that I'll need to know if you're gonna

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
that I'll need to know if you're gonna
compensate<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.160> recoil<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.330> anyway<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
compensate your recoil but anyway so I

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
compensate your recoil but anyway so I
was<00:00:31.439> looking<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> simplex<00:00:32.610> form<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
was looking at the simplex form and I

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.970 
was looking at the simplex form and I
found<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.840> very<00:00:34.050> interesting<00:00:34.170> article

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
found this very interesting article

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
found this very interesting article
stating<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.170> combination<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
stating that the combination of the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.880 
stating that the combination of the
l85a2<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> prism<00:00:39.510> aside<00:00:39.809> eliminates<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
l85a2 and the prism aside eliminates the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.180 
l85a2 and the prism aside eliminates the
entire<00:00:41.040> visual<00:00:41.879> recoil<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.590> didn't

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
entire visual recoil and I first didn't

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
entire visual recoil and I first didn't
trust<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> source<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.600> all<00:00:45.780> um<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.590> from

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
trust that source at all um it was from

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.690 
trust that source at all um it was from
the<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.520> unknown<00:00:48.120> guy<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.700> that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the very unknown guy so I was like that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.299 
the very unknown guy so I was like that
just<00:00:51.030> sounds<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.660> fishy<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> decided<00:00:53.250> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just sounds really fishy so I decided to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
just sounds really fishy so I decided to
try<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.480> took<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:54.780> quite<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.050> while

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
try it out and it took me quite a while

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
try it out and it took me quite a while
to<00:00:55.320> unlock<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> personal<00:00:56.309> side<00:00:56.460> because

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
to unlock the personal side because

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
to unlock the personal side because
personal<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> battle<00:00:58.500> pack

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
personal side is in the battle pack

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
personal side is in the battle pack
instead<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.370> unlocking<00:00:59.879> naturally<00:01:00.390> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
instead of just unlocking naturally I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
instead of just unlocking naturally I
was<00:01:01.020> able<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> first<00:01:02.280> time

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
was able to get in just the first time

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.990 
was able to get in just the first time
with<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.570> about<00:01:03.809> tag<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.320> l85a2<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
with a lot about tag of l85a2 so I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
with a lot about tag of l85a2 so I
started<00:01:06.570> playing<00:01:06.720> around<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> yes

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
started playing around with it and yes

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
started playing around with it and yes
it<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:10.110> any<00:01:10.320> visual

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it was right it do not have any visual

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
it was right it do not have any visual
recoil<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:12.990> keep<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
recoil at all but what did they keep in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.580 
recoil at all but what did they keep in
mind<00:01:13.530> though<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.240> l85a2<00:01:15.240> already<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
mind though is that l85a2 already have a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
mind though is that l85a2 already have a
very<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.280> high<00:01:17.670> internal<00:01:18.180> recoil<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.869> mean

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
very very high internal recoil I mean

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
very very high internal recoil I mean
like<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> physical<00:01:19.860> recoil<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> mean<00:01:20.759> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like the physical recoil what I mean so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
like the physical recoil what I mean so
the<00:01:21.840> visual<00:01:22.020> recoil<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.040> completely

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the visual recoil like it's completely

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.490 
the visual recoil like it's completely
gone<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.390> still<00:01:24.810> need<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> compensate

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
gone but you still need to compensate

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
gone but you still need to compensate
that<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.580> high<00:01:26.970> side-to-side<00:01:27.720> recoil

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
that very very high side-to-side recoil

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
that very very high side-to-side recoil
and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> vertical<00:01:29.579> recoil<00:01:29.759> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
and then the vertical recoil so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960 
and then the vertical recoil so
basically<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.290> gun<00:01:31.500> takes<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.610> three

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
basically this gun takes point for three

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.330 
basically this gun takes point for three
upward<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> point<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.170> five<00:01:34.500> sideways<00:01:35.100> which

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
upward and point to five sideways which

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.700 
upward and point to five sideways which
is<00:01:35.549> considered<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.479> more<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.229> high

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
is considered as more the very high

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.550 
is considered as more the very high
recoil<00:01:38.340> gun<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.509> also<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.990> con<00:01:40.200> used<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
recoil gun and also this con used to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.069 
recoil gun and also this con used to
fire<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:41.100> 850<00:01:41.939> rounds<00:01:42.210> per<00:01:42.240> minute<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
fire at 850 rounds per minute but I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.899 
fire at 850 rounds per minute but I
guess<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> die<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.890> decided<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> nerf<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
guess the die is decided to nerf this

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.539 
guess the die is decided to nerf this
gun<00:01:45.180> quite<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.780> down<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.259> 750<00:01:47.159> watts<00:01:47.369> per

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
gun quite a bit down to 750 watts per

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
gun quite a bit down to 750 watts per
minute<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.740> much

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
minute was I think it was just too much

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
minute was I think it was just too much
because<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> compare<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.180> weapon<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
because if you compare this weapon to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
because if you compare this weapon to
like<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> m416<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.340> example<00:01:53.820> which<00:01:54.030> fires

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
like the m416 for example which fires

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
like the m416 for example which fires
have<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.840> similar<00:01:55.170> rounds<00:01:55.649> per<00:01:55.799> minute

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
have pretty similar rounds per minute

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
have pretty similar rounds per minute
and<00:01:56.159> has<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> very<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.420> easy<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:58.079> manage

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and has a very very easy to manage

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.190 
and has a very very easy to manage
recoil<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.780> kind<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
recoil I just think that it was kind of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
recoil I just think that it was kind of
too<00:02:01.439> rough<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.130> comparing<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
too rough but comparing with the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840 
too rough but comparing with the
personal<00:02:03.659> side<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.530> l85a2<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.700> not

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
personal side and then the l85a2 I'm not

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
personal side and then the l85a2 I'm not
gonna<00:02:06.000> guarantee<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.630> you're<00:02:06.780> gonna<00:02:06.899> get

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
gonna guarantee that you're gonna get

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.889 
gonna guarantee that you're gonna get
like<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.619> high<00:02:07.890> kill<00:02:08.220> rate<00:02:08.250> ratio<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.090> one

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
like very high kill rate ratio but one

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.089 
like very high kill rate ratio but one
thing<00:02:10.080> at<00:02:10.319> least<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.770> thing<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.950> could

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
thing at least one thing I could

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
thing at least one thing I could
guarantee<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.060> damaged

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
guarantee that is gonna be damaged

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.770 
guarantee that is gonna be damaged
this<00:02:13.650> gameplay<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.909> just<00:02:15.480> don't

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
this gameplay right here I just don't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.270 
this gameplay right here I just don't
know<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.019> happened<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.739> beginning<00:02:17.189> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
know what happened in the beginning I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.920 
know what happened in the beginning I
was<00:02:17.459> using<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.909> heavy<00:02:18.180> barrel<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
was using the heavy barrel with the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
was using the heavy barrel with the
combination<00:02:19.439> all<00:02:19.890> stubby<00:02:20.280> grip<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.730> take<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
combination all stubby grip to take the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
combination all stubby grip to take the
full<00:02:21.450> advantage<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.439> elimination<00:02:23.250> of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
full advantage of the elimination of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.789 
full advantage of the elimination of
visual<00:02:23.760> recoil<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.689> guess<00:02:25.109> that<00:02:25.439> did<00:02:25.650> not

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
visual recoil but I guess that did not

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.459 
visual recoil but I guess that did not
happen<00:02:26.099> as<00:02:26.579> my<00:02:26.819> estimation<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.109> was<00:02:28.230> kind

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
happen as my estimation so that was kind

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.039 
happen as my estimation so that was kind
of<00:02:28.560> bad<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.219> at<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> very<00:02:29.760> end<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.209> turned<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
of bad but at the very end I turned it

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.750 
of bad but at the very end I turned it
turned<00:02:31.230> out<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.469> be<00:02:31.590> pretty<00:02:31.769> well<00:02:32.069> um<00:02:32.310> after

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
turned out to be pretty well um after

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.149 
turned out to be pretty well um after
dying<00:02:33.209> couple<00:02:33.659> times<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.230> switched<00:02:34.739> back<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> I

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
dying couple times I switched back to I

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.000 
dying couple times I switched back to I
think<00:02:35.579> mostly<00:02:36.540> brake<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.049> then<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.500> angle

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
think mostly brake and then the angle

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.879 
think mostly brake and then the angle
were<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.430> minimize<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.139> physical<00:02:40.139> recoil<00:02:40.560> I

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
were to minimize that physical recoil I

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.039 
were to minimize that physical recoil I
was<00:02:41.069> able<00:02:41.219> to<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.579> around<00:02:41.700> would<00:02:42.239> be<00:02:42.420> very<00:02:42.629> good

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
was able to go around would be very good

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.780 
was able to go around would be very good
kill<00:02:43.379> streak<00:02:43.650> which<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.219> thing<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.549> pretty

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
kill streak which that thing is pretty

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.879 
kill streak which that thing is pretty
cool<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.689> if<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.049> guys<00:02:46.169> want<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.439> check<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.769> out

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
cool so if you guys want to check it out

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.860 
cool so if you guys want to check it out
you<00:02:47.189> should<00:02:47.430> definitely<00:02:48.150> try<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.419> use<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
you should definitely try to use the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.979 
you should definitely try to use the
personal<00:02:49.319> side<00:02:49.500> with<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:49.950> l85a2<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.939> had<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> lot

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
personal side with the l85a2 I had a lot

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.960 
personal side with the l85a2 I had a lot
of<00:02:52.079> fun<00:02:52.230> using<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.889> I<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.400> if<00:02:53.700> I'm<00:02:53.790> gonna

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
of fun using it and I know if I'm gonna

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.640 
of fun using it and I know if I'm gonna
use<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.269> in<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> future<00:02:54.659> but<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.290> definitely

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
use it in the future but this definitely

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.649 
use it in the future but this definitely
gonna<00:02:56.069> be<00:02:56.189> one<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:56.519> favorite<00:02:56.970> classes<00:02:57.419> to

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
gonna be one of my favorite classes to

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.319 
gonna be one of my favorite classes to
go<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.079> far<00:02:58.500> as<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:59.010> visual<00:02:59.219> recoil<00:02:59.609> goes<00:03:00.090> in

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
go as far as the visual recoil goes in

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.690 
go as far as the visual recoil goes in
battlefield<00:03:00.870> 4<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:01.889> you<00:03:01.980> guys<00:03:02.099> can<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:02.400> in

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
battlefield 4 so as you guys can see in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.209 
battlefield 4 so as you guys can see in
the<00:03:02.790> score<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> am<00:03:03.810> there<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.439> pretty<00:03:04.739> decent<00:03:05.159> job

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
the score I am there a pretty decent job

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.159 
the score I am there a pretty decent job
but<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.819> didn't<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.450> these<00:03:06.689> super<00:03:07.019> well

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169
