00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
in the pink and so I'm going to go one

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.080 
in the pink and so I'm going to go one
more<00:03:41.320> round<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:42.070> three<00:03:42.340> colors<00:03:42.790> but

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
more round and it's three colors but

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.870 
more round and it's three colors but

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
really it's two whites in a pink so it's

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.030

going to have its going to fade it in a
little<00:03:48.280> bit<00:03:48.460> slower<00:03:48.790> because<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.360> going<00:03:49.480> to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
little bit slower because it's going to

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.920 
little bit slower because it's going to
seem<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:49.930> more<00:03:50.140> white
