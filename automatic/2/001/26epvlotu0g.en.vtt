of time and resources so it's critical

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
of time and resources so it's critical
that<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> great<00:00:11.849> game<00:00:12.090> camera<00:00:12.540> that's

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that we have a great game camera that's

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
that we have a great game camera that's
going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> capture<00:00:13.440> high-quality<00:00:13.679> images<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
into our food plots and mineral sites so

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
into our food plots and mineral sites so
what<00:00:19.410> makes<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> great<00:00:19.949> game<00:00:20.279> camera<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.150> it

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
what makes a great game camera to me it

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.849 
what makes a great game camera to me it
starts<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> company<00:00:22.199> making<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.710> in

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
starts with the company making them in

starts with the company making them in
spy<00:00:23.460> point<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:24.300> only<00:00:24.330> produces<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.439> develops

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
spy point not only produces and develops

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.910 
spy point not only produces and develops
high-quality<00:00:26.820> game<00:00:27.689> hunting<00:00:28.080> cameras<00:00:28.500> but

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
high-quality game hunting cameras but

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
high-quality game hunting cameras but
they<00:00:29.070> also<00:00:29.279> develop<00:00:30.000> high<00:00:30.210> quality

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
they also develop high quality

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
they also develop high quality
surveillance<00:00:31.470> security<00:00:31.650> systems<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
surveillance security systems so the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
surveillance security systems so the
engineers<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.750> spy<00:00:33.989> point<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.410> figured<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
engineers at spy point have figured this

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.319 
engineers at spy point have figured this
game<00:00:35.040> camera<00:00:35.430> thing<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.149> only

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
game camera thing out of not only

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
game camera thing out of not only
incorporating<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> latest<00:00:37.380> technologies

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
incorporating the latest technologies

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430 
incorporating the latest technologies
into<00:00:38.969> these<00:00:39.090> game<00:00:39.329> cameras<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:39.899> doing<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> at

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
into these game cameras but doing it at

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
into these game cameras but doing it at
a<00:00:40.530> great<00:00:40.770> value<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.399> today<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
a great value and today we're going to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.240 
a great value and today we're going to
talk<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> aisle<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.260> seven<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.860> what

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
talk about the aisle or seven and what

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
talk about the aisle or seven and what
makes<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> spy<00:00:44.879> point<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.510> seven<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> great

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
makes the spy point I are seven a great

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.990 
makes the spy point I are seven a great
game<00:00:46.530> camera<00:00:46.920> well<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.219> three<00:00:47.489> things<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
game camera well it's three things it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.410 
game camera well it's three things it's
reliable<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.590> easy<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> use<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
reliable it's easy to use and it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
reliable it's easy to use and it
produces<00:00:51.870> high-quality<00:00:52.079> images<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> video

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
produces high-quality images and video

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
produces high-quality images and video
so<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.360> makes<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.750> five<00:00:55.020> point<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.410> seven

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
so what makes this five point are seven

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
so what makes this five point are seven
such<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> reliable<00:00:56.910> game<00:00:57.120> camera<00:00:57.570> there's<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
such a reliable game camera there's a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
such a reliable game camera there's a
number<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> reasons<00:00:58.890> how<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.760> fast<00:01:00.210> trigger

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
