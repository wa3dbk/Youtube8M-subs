another<00:01:45.570> phone<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.380> clearly<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
another phone so that's clearly a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.999 
another phone so that's clearly a
security<00:01:47.909> flaw<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.840> could<00:01:49.110> come<00:01:49.350> along<00:01:49.500> take

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
security flaw some could come along take

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
security flaw some could come along take
a<00:01:50.040> picture<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.759> using<00:01:51.119> their<00:01:51.270> phone<00:01:51.600> and

a picture of you using their phone and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.130 
a picture of you using their phone and
it<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.680> potentially<00:01:52.829> unlock<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.909> device

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
it could potentially unlock your device

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.749 
it could potentially unlock your device
they're<00:01:55.140> using<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.950> other<00:01:56.070> picture<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
they're using the other picture so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.300 
they're using the other picture so
that's<00:01:56.939> clearly<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.689> security<00:01:58.259> flaw<00:01:58.469> obviously

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that's clearly a security flaw obviously

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
that's clearly a security flaw obviously
something<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> should<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> addressed<00:02:00.960> by

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
something that should be addressed by

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649 
something that should be addressed by
Google<00:02:01.649> obviously<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> hear<00:02:03.420> though

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
Google obviously from what I hear though

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660 
Google obviously from what I hear though
on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.350> galaxy<00:02:04.799> s3<00:02:04.950> they're<00:02:05.369> gonna<00:02:05.460> have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
on the galaxy s3 they're gonna have

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
on the galaxy s3 they're gonna have
something<00:02:06.060> where<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.390> use<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> voice<00:02:07.170> command

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
something where you use a voice command

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
something where you use a voice command
as<00:02:07.770> well<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.160> unlock<00:02:08.369> their<00:02:08.550> phone<00:02:08.580> along<00:02:08.940> with

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
as well to unlock their phone along with

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
as well to unlock their phone along with
your<00:02:09.270> face<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> don't<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.950> they

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
your face so I don't know I think they

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
your face so I don't know I think they
should<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:12.030> something<00:02:12.239> where<00:02:12.599> like<00:02:12.629> if<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
should do something where like if the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.580 
should do something where like if the
blink

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
blink

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
blink
couple<00:02:13.920> times<00:02:14.129> for<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.790> recognize<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.599> it's

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
couple times for it to recognize so it's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.050 
couple times for it to recognize so it's
obviously<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.140> movement<00:02:16.410> thing<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.160> obviously

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
obviously a movement thing but obviously

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
obviously a movement thing but obviously
there<00:02:18.239> could<00:02:18.420> be<00:02:18.450> issues<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.379> it's

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
there could be issues there so it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 
there could be issues there so it's
obviously<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.950> very<00:02:20.069> difficult<00:02:20.459> thing<00:02:20.819> that's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
obviously a very difficult thing that's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.930 
obviously a very difficult thing that's
why<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.690> put<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> low<00:02:22.530> security<00:02:23.040> lock

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
why they put it as a low security lock

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.880 
why they put it as a low security lock
let's<00:02:24.840> try<00:02:25.019> once<00:02:25.230> more<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> thought<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.769> was

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
let's try once more I thought that was

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.320 
let's try once more I thought that was
actually<00:02:26.129> kind<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.340> neat<00:02:26.550> how<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.940> works<00:02:27.180> so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
actually kind of neat how that works so

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.920 
actually kind of neat how that works so
well<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:29.250> obviously<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:30.000> neat<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.660> sense

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
well it's obviously not neat in a sense

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
well it's obviously not neat in a sense
of<00:02:31.170> oh<00:02:31.349> no<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:31.799> phone's<00:02:32.040> gonna<00:02:32.280> get<00:02:32.459> hacked<00:02:32.670> but

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of oh no my phone's gonna get hacked but

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.699 
of oh no my phone's gonna get hacked but
just<00:02:33.750> kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.019> neat<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> actually

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
just kind of neat that it actually

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:35.930 
just kind of neat that it actually
worked<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.310> didn't<00:02:35.489> think<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.670> was<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.849> work

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
worked I didn't think it was gonna work

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.140 
worked I didn't think it was gonna work
that<00:02:36.269> well<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.959> honest<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.849> didn't<00:02:38.849> realize

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
that well to be honest I didn't realize

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.330 
that well to be honest I didn't realize
that<00:02:39.180> because<00:02:40.049> I<00:02:40.140> mean<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.319> haven't<00:02:41.040> tried<00:02:41.190> this

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
that because I mean I haven't tried this

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.210 
that because I mean I haven't tried this
before<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.970> mean<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.989> new<00:02:43.799> thing<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
before so I mean this is a new thing I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.580 
before so I mean this is a new thing I
just<00:02:44.250> tried<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.840> definitely<00:02:46.110> working

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
just tried and it's definitely working

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.190 
just tried and it's definitely working
so<00:02:46.799> there<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.940> would<00:02:48.150> be

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
so there you have it there that would be

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.330 
so there you have it there that would be
just<00:02:49.200> kind<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.410> an<00:02:49.530> issue<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.069> face

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
just kind of an issue with the face

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.620 
just kind of an issue with the face
