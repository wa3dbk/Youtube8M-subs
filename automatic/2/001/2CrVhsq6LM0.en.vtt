00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.370
 hello girls this tutorial we're going to 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.380
 do today it's about a landscape in blue 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.209
 and black with a kind of tree in the 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.190
 center and to make this landscape 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.980
 we're going to need a blue base color 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.940
 like for example this but you can use 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.940
 what do you have 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.530
 this is number 385 of kiko 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.530
 now clear glaze 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.020
 let's use acrylic paint 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.680
 for example this is the American brand 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.600
 I used the following colors 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.260
 I used 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.730
 black blue and white here I've been a 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.750
 little white with blue and here I have 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.250
 mixed a little black with blue 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.110
 The first thing we are going to do is with the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.630
 blue mixed with black we take a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.370
 bit 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.100
 and good with a small brush that you have 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.940
 thin you can buy it anywhere 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.200
 of crafts we make a line 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.200
 let's go painting this and the little one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 simultaneously 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.020
 and then we are going to take 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.799
 the color 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.799
 to dot 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.090
 you see here let's see it 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.859
 and let's do the fund first let's 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.490
 a few lines as if it were 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.490
 mountains 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.630
 and we painted 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 the rest of the colored nail 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.510
 this will be our heaven worth 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.030
 the mountains do not know very big 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.820
 because then it goes to the tree and if it's very 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.760
 dark is not seen in the twig 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 we already have the sky of this nail and now 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.369
 let's go with this one 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.990
 we say the little hours that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.990
 you alone seem 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.330
 we have all the nail 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.549
 we have our sky 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.489
 and we change color now I'm going to catch 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.480
 the blue this is normal but if in 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.409
 the boat 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.409
 and down here 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.920
 well 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.920
 down a little bit 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.490
 OK 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.770
 this is going to be water 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.770
 this wedge and now it 's 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.500
 and now we have now let's paint 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.670
 behind the tree there is a kind of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.290
 clouds and to make the clouds I'm going to use 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.040
 so the different whites and blues 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.190
 clear that I have first with white 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.780
 Y 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.780
 drawing as if it were a cloud 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.459
 better said 2 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.830
 and now I choose blue 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.830
 written and I'm going 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.800
 giving a little 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.030
 If you want, you can take the opportunity to tune 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.030
 a little more 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.690
 the little one 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.390
 3 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.850
 mixing 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.840
 OK 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.130
 we change color and now I'm going to do 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.130
 a black line 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.669
 on this line 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.229
 and now with the black 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.710
 here at the base of the nail as if they were 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:44.300
 beers 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.300
 up with the black 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.800
 the first 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.569
 in the small buoy 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.760
 we have now we are going to make the 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.969
 proper tree 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.639
 then we go back to pick up the leaf 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.219
 and we make the trunk 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.760
 all this decade up the mountains 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.729
 we go 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.669
 Y 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.510
 from the trunk we are going to sing 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.080
 clearly 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.169
 and that the virgin twigs 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.639
 and the trunk we are taking out the different 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.990
 twigs 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:49.280
 again think convenient 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.280
 and do not be too fat 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.720
 with the other tree 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.890
 we can make a cum 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.890
 and from a how we get the twigs 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.770
 nani 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.640
 let's pass it a little blue 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.180
 dark here that here to say how 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.180
 if I suffered 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.289
 let's do it 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.249
 so that they all stay the same 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.249
 and here also little 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.380
 well we have finished now 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.620
 transparent faithful paste when dry 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:08.110
 so that it stays as it is in the 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.000
 big nail I made two trees you see 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:15.220
 because a tree seemed very little to me 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.230
 so I've made two trees worth 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.080
 I will try to pass the excellent one 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:24.659
 time and it's not going 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.659
 because it's almost dry we have vertices 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.370
 I'm going 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.900
 You see how he stays in the client 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:45.000
 and now it is finished I hope that 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.000
 you liked it
