it all but for this example I'll only be
using<00:01:07.159> one<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> files<00:01:11.299> I'll<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.689> be

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
using one of the files I'll just be

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
using one of the files I'll just be
using<00:01:13.250> walk<00:01:18.080> okay<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:19.799> thing<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.070> need

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
blender is enabled in blender so if you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.440 
blender is enabled in blender so if you
search<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.190> make<00:02:15.060> walk<00:02:16.970> ensure<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.180> this

check mark is checked off if you don't
see<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.180> then<00:02:24.260> go<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.770> make<00:02:26.730> human

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
see this then go to your make human

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.650 
see this then go to your make human
installation<00:02:28.020> directory<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> Blender

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
probably be under scripts and add-ons so
