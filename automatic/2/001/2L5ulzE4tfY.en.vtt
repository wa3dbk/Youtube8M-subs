00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 that proposes with claude in order to you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 to start reading a page 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.109
 internet on a device and has it completed 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.779
 on another this function is called 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.039
 tabs icloud 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.180
 but before I start I take 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.800
 a few seconds to inform those 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 of you who want a maximum of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 information about their apple products 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.900
 I offer subscribers of the newsletter 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.119
 exclusive tips that are not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 available neither on the site used on 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 mac - like neither on the youtube channel 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.090
 corresponding to subscribe it is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.700
 free and it is by clicking here that it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 happens 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.790
 but let's go back to this video before we 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 show you how these work 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 famous hong lei club it would take 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 maybe create such an account icloud 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.850
 so if you do not have one already, you have to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
 start with that with lot matches 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.030
 in fact to internet services that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.399
 offers apple and who are for the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.760
 most free to access you 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.500
 will create an apple ID even if 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.000
 the builder of the mac encourages very 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.379
 strongly the user has returned his 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 bank details during the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 creation of this call said it's not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.869
 mandatory do not hesitate 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 to create such an identifier you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.310
 refer to one of my old tricks 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 j explains how to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.689
 create an account without returning from 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.280
 bank details 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 but once your apple has said is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.619
 created you still have to connect it to your 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.780
 apple products on mac 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.610
 just go to the menu 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 apple in order to launch the preferences 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.759
 system 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 then direction in clown then you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 return this call said good at home 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 it's already done on ipad iphone you 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 must perform the same task 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.090
 it will be in the settings that you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 will be able to access icloud my login 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.770
 is also connected to the ipad but if 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.590
 this is not the case with you it will be necessary 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.880
 do it now 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.799
 but I have good news for you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 once the same apple id 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.909
 went back on your different devices 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.520
 there is nothing special to do 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.080
 realize this gift josÃ© speak the purpose of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.869
 the trick I remind him is to read a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.540
 part 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.349
 a web page on my mac but of 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.659
 finish it on my ipad and start well 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.750
 I'm going to open safari to start on 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.989
 my mac and I suggest you search 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.980
 my next culinary attempt 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.239
 I would like to realize in a few days 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.239
 a chocolate banana clafoutis 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.140
 so I launch the search and I look 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.549
 what we propose 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.290
 hold this recipe 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.540
 the last time I went on this 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.140
 site the result was delicious I 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.140
 retry my luck 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.950
 so here is the famous recipe she is not 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.480
 not necessarily very visible with the ad 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.129
 who is around but I remember that in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 a previous tip I talked to you 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.930
 of the player mode that allows safari to 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.069
 only show the article on the page 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.379
 internet that is under your eyes 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.359
 so do not hesitate to take a tour in 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.970
 this trick to know everything about this 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.829
 famous fashion 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.359
 but let's go back to our sheep and more 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.879
 precisely to our class banana tools 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.049
 chocolate when I cook I have 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.790
 tendency to see ipad on the plane of 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.680
 work rather than my mac it takes 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.459
 less space and it's especially more 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.769
 easy to clean 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.419
 so I know that I found very 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.220
 easily this cooking recipe and 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.709
 that I will be able to find it too 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.180
 easily on my ipad but I you 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.280
 reminds that this is just an example 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.379
 but very often I come across 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 recipes after not bad to click on 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.790
 several different sites 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.510
 so how to find this 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.120
 recipe on my ipad without going through a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.470
 google search 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.480
 I can of course record it as 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.579
 signed with synchronized slats 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.680
 automatically signed them between my 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.730
 different devices 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.590
 except that I tend to put a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.319
 aged page signed only when I 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.160
 I'm sure I want to keep it 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.430
 so in the case of a recipe of 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.549
 cooking games 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.950
 first test it so I have left me 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.870
 more than to use tabs eyes 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.000
 closed 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.530
 I go directly to the ipad since 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.810
 I told you there was nothing to 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.310
 do special to use it and I 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.609
 immediately open a page 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.959
 safari once I'm here there is 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.160
 than to touch the icon that allows you to 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.639
 navigate between the different tabs 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.280
 open on my ipad but different 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.770
 are slippery and if my regrets that 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.759
 I have below these are the famous ones 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.639
 tab icloud 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.320
 in fact I do not have my macbook air 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.780
 and my ipad put on which are 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.550
 recorded my apple said I 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.080
 also two imac and my iphone and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.789
 alright I can see all the pages 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.500
 internet open on one of these 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.360
 appliances 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.820
 if I go on macbeth which is the name of 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.889
 macbook air I can find the recipe 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.389
 clafoutis on which I fell 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.370
 a short time ago and by touching her the 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.599
 page poster 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.409
 I just have to go into the 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.360
 dessert project as you see 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.580
 it's pretty handy if you have 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.750
 several apple devices i'm going 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.090
 add a little precision anyway 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.130
 there is no need that all your 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.080
 devices either turned on and connected to 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.560
 internet to have access to these tabs 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.139
 iCloud 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.090
 in fact if you no longer have access to 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.190
 the device you used to 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.789
 read a web page the address of 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.560
 the latter 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.570
 if it is not updated will be 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.000
 deleted but only after 14 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.620
 days in May not to be jealous 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.110
 I will show you what it gives 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.520
 on my mac 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.409
 so I always safari open and I 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.979
 go click on the same icon as on 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.699
 my ipad and I have access to the nails 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.159
 and have lot of my different devices 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.840
 so you're on an idevice 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.909
 iphone ipad ipod touch or on a mac 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.340
 you will be able to surf the internet 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.820
 without worrying about which 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.539
 apparatus 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.650
 you started this or that page 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.599
 I will still summarize this trick 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.570
 even though as you found it there 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:04.250
 has very little manipulation to do 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.509
 so to take advantage of this 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.159
 functionality you have to have a 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.060
 account iCloud and have it registered 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.910
 in 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.660
 different devices on bone 10 that's 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.889
 goes into system preferences 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:19.180
 heading icloud and on ios it will be in 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.200
 high ruler settings also 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.090
 then you just have to 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.480
 surf as you see fit 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.639
 using safari and even if you 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.680
 turn off your device 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.280
 if you switch to another of your 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.350
 apple products 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.840
 you can go to this icon 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.790
 find all the pages 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.620
 open internet subject to 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.300
 have open safari and have 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
 connected to the internet the part is used 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.340
 since less than 14 days 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.389
 this trick is over I hope she 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.220
 you will save time 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.190
 when you switch from a mac 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.900
