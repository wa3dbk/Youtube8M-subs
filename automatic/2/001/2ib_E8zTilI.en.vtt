hi<00:00:07.529> everyone<00:00:07.859> Aaron<00:00:08.340> here<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:08.700> Zolo<00:00:08.970> tech<00:00:09.179> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
hi everyone Aaron here for Zolo tech and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.330 
hi everyone Aaron here for Zolo tech and
I<00:00:09.570> thought<00:00:09.780> we'd<00:00:09.960> do<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> comparison<00:00:10.769> or<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I thought we'd do a comparison or a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.129 
I thought we'd do a comparison or a
quick<00:00:11.639> comparison<00:00:11.820> between<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.599> fingerprint

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
quick comparison between the fingerprint

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.950 
quick comparison between the fingerprint
sensors<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> oneplus<00:00:14.460> 2<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.599> iPhone

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
sensors on the oneplus 2 and the iPhone

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.710 
sensors on the oneplus 2 and the iPhone
6<00:00:16.320> plus<00:00:16.500> now<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.880> point<00:00:18.210> pretty<00:00:18.600> much

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
6 plus now up to this point pretty much

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
6 plus now up to this point pretty much
the<00:00:19.050> iPhone<00:00:19.380> 6<00:00:19.680> plus<00:00:19.859> has<00:00:20.189> been<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.760> most

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the iPhone 6 plus has been the most

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.109 
the iPhone 6 plus has been the most
accurate<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.630> fastest<00:00:22.230> fingerprint<00:00:22.769> reader

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
accurate and fastest fingerprint reader

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.640 
accurate and fastest fingerprint reader
that<00:00:24.119> I've<00:00:24.269> used<00:00:24.570> anyway<00:00:24.960> I've<00:00:25.080> used<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that I've used anyway I've used all the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
that I've used anyway I've used all the
different<00:00:25.949> fingerprint<00:00:26.430> readers<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
different fingerprint readers on all of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.849 
different fingerprint readers on all of
the<00:00:27.420> different<00:00:27.750> phones<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.289> find<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.680> one

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the different phones and I find this one

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.339 
the different phones and I find this one
to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.099> quickest<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.789> most<00:00:29.880> accurate

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
to be the quickest and most accurate

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.470 
to be the quickest and most accurate
however<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:32.340> could<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.759> all<00:00:32.880> changed<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
however that could have all changed with

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
however that could have all changed with
the<00:00:33.600> oneplus<00:00:33.989> 2<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> oneplus<00:00:35.370> 2<00:00:35.610> has<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the oneplus 2 now the oneplus 2 has a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.180 
the oneplus 2 now the oneplus 2 has a
fingerprint<00:00:36.300> sensor<00:00:36.540> right<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.920> not

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
fingerprint sensor right here that's not

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
fingerprint sensor right here that's not
a<00:00:38.219> button<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.879> iPhone<00:00:39.480> actually<00:00:39.809> has<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
a button the iPhone actually has a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.330 
a button the iPhone actually has a
button<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> after<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
button so what you do is after you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
button so what you do is after you
register<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.820> fingerprint<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.780> push<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
register your fingerprint you push the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
register your fingerprint you push the
button<00:00:43.590> hold<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.219> finger<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
button hold your finger on it and it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.529 
button hold your finger on it and it
unlocks<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.730> instead<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.030> putting<00:00:48.420> your

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
unlocks so instead of just putting your

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.790 
unlocks so instead of just putting your
finger<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.260> won't<00:00:49.379> work<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
finger there that won't work you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
finger there that won't work you
actually<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> push<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.090> then

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
actually have to push it down and then

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
actually have to push it down and then
hold<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.079> oneplus<00:00:52.500> 2<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> put<00:00:53.129> your

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
hold on the oneplus 2 you put your

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.389 
hold on the oneplus 2 you put your
finger<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.320> then<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.649> unlocks<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
finger there and then it unlocks you

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
finger there and then it unlocks you
just<00:00:56.610> hold<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.910> finger<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.480> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
just hold your finger there and it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.540 
just hold your finger there and it
unlocks<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.800> wanted<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> show<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
unlocks so I wanted to show you the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
unlocks so I wanted to show you the
different<00:00:59.879> speed<00:01:00.210> differences<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
different speed differences and how that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
different speed differences and how that
works<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.550> give<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.969> try<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.390> this

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
works so let's give it a try now this

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
works so let's give it a try now this
one<00:01:04.350> seems<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:05.299> working<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.479> 99%<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
one seems to be working about 99% of the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
one seems to be working about 99% of the
time<00:01:07.890> sometimes<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.580> doesn't<00:01:08.820> register<00:01:09.000> my

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
time sometimes it doesn't register my

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.490 
time sometimes it doesn't register my
finger<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> device<00:01:12.350> 99%<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
finger and turn on the device 99% of the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
finger and turn on the device 99% of the
time<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.070> works<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> iPhone<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:15.150> well

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
time it works on the iPhone as well

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.999 
time it works on the iPhone as well
neither<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> work<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.560> fingers<00:01:16.860> are

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
neither of them work if your fingers are

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.830 
neither of them work if your fingers are
wet<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.430> I've<00:01:17.850> programmed<00:01:18.090> both<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.720> these

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
wet so I've programmed both of these

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.990 
wet so I've programmed both of these
fingers<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.710> each<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> touch<00:01:20.310> ID<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.880> we

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
fingers into each of the touch ID so we

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
fingers into each of the touch ID so we
could<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> test<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.619> let's<00:01:22.830> move

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
could do this test here so let's move

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
could do this test here so let's move
these<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> I'll<00:01:24.540> show<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> we'll<00:01:25.530> put

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
these up and I'll show you we'll put

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
these up and I'll show you we'll put
these<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.430> I'll<00:01:26.580> push<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.450> hold<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
these on here I'll push and hold and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.609 
these on here I'll push and hold and
then<00:01:28.380> tap<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.759> time<00:01:33.060> touch<00:01:33.869> ID<00:01:34.140> 1<00:01:34.470> on

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
then tap here so that time touch ID 1 on

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:43.100 
then tap here so that time touch ID 1 on
the<00:01:34.740> iPhone<00:01:35.070> 6<00:01:35.340> plus<00:01:35.520> let's<00:01:35.909> try<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.210> again<00:01:42.110> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the iPhone 6 plus let's try it again see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.080 
the iPhone 6 plus let's try it again see
at<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> time<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.040> iPhone<00:01:44.430> lost<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.909> had<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
at that time the iPhone lost I had to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.889 
at that time the iPhone lost I had to
push<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> button<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:48.240> said<00:01:48.570> none

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
push the button again now that said none

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
push the button again now that said none
of<00:01:49.020> these<00:01:49.140> are<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.649> perfect<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.369> want

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
of these are actually perfect so I want

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
of these are actually perfect so I want
to<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> couple<00:01:51.240> different<00:01:51.509> times<00:01:51.659> now

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to do this a couple different times now

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.450 
to do this a couple different times now
I've<00:01:51.930> also<00:01:52.079> programmed<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.740> thumb<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.310> let's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I've also programmed my thumb so let's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
I've also programmed my thumb so let's
try<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:56.390> there<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.479> go

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
try these there we go

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
try these there we go
the<00:01:58.229> oneplus<00:01:58.469> 2<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> definitely<00:01:59.430> faster<00:02:00.180> in

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the oneplus 2 is definitely faster in

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
the oneplus 2 is definitely faster in
that<00:02:00.329> test<00:02:00.719> we'll<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> again<00:02:03.740> there<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.860> go

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that test we'll do it again there we go

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
that test we'll do it again there we go
so<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> had<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.000> click<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> iPhone

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
so I had to click it again on the iPhone

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
so I had to click it again on the iPhone
and<00:02:07.920> let's<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.819> more<00:02:08.849> time<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and let's do it one more time with the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.190 
and let's do it one more time with the
thumbs

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410 

see<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.040> time<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.610> didn't<00:02:13.849> register<00:02:14.000> my

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
see in that time it didn't register my

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.460 
see in that time it didn't register my
thumb<00:02:14.630> or<00:02:15.319> again<00:02:15.680> now<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.760> did<00:02:16.940> so<00:02:17.510> both<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
thumb or again now it did so both of

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.530 
thumb or again now it did so both of
them<00:02:18.620> are<00:02:18.770> not<00:02:18.890> perfect<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.730> there<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> little

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
them are not perfect in there a little

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.339 
them are not perfect in there a little
bit<00:02:20.690> hit-and-miss

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
bit hit-and-miss

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.220 
bit hit-and-miss
but<00:02:21.950> they're<00:02:22.130> both<00:02:22.430> very<00:02:22.849> good<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.390> usually<00:02:24.200> I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
but they're both very good and usually I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.199 
but they're both very good and usually I
find<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.980> 1<00:02:25.160> plus<00:02:25.400> 2<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.849> little<00:02:26.120> bit

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
find the 1 plus 2 to be a little bit

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.180 
find the 1 plus 2 to be a little bit
quicker<00:02:26.510> as<00:02:26.780> far<00:02:27.020> as<00:02:27.170> unlocking<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.099> I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
quicker as far as unlocking so if I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.190 
quicker as far as unlocking so if I
bring<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.550> up<00:02:28.700> here<00:02:28.970> I'll<00:02:29.060> show<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
bring this up here I'll show you if I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
bring this up here I'll show you if I
shut<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.500> off<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.800> then<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.670> put<00:02:34.910> my<00:02:35.030> thumb<00:02:35.360> down

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
shut it off and then I put my thumb down

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.559 
shut it off and then I put my thumb down
it<00:02:37.730> unlocks<00:02:39.370> we'll<00:02:40.370> do<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.790> more<00:02:40.880> time<00:02:41.030> so

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
it unlocks we'll do it one more time so

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.680 
it unlocks we'll do it one more time so
you'll<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:41.959> I'll<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.080> tap<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.650> hold<00:02:43.690> didn't

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
you'll see I'll just tap and hold didn't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370 
you'll see I'll just tap and hold didn't
work<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.080> time<00:02:46.239> or<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.540> time<00:02:47.600> there<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.260> go

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
work that time or that time there we go

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.990 
work that time or that time there we go
and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.769> did<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.220> sometimes<00:02:49.700> there's<00:02:49.940> a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and then it did so sometimes there's a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.120 
and then it did so sometimes there's a
little<00:02:50.120> bit<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> delay<00:02:50.780> now<00:02:51.650> let's<00:02:51.860> try<00:02:52.100> it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
little bit of a delay now let's try it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.509 
little bit of a delay now let's try it
with<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.580> iPhone<00:02:53.060> six-plus<00:02:54.160> will<00:02:55.160> bring<00:02:55.340> this

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
with the iPhone six-plus will bring this

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.970 
with the iPhone six-plus will bring this
up<00:02:55.730> shut<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.569> display<00:02:57.019> off<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:58.209> click<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
up shut the display off here click and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240 
up shut the display off here click and
unlock<00:03:01.750> again<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.799> do<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.130> this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
unlock again I can do it with this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.410 
unlock again I can do it with this
finger<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.819> click<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:07.220> unlock<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.180> can

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
finger to click and unlock so you can

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.890 
finger to click and unlock so you can
see<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.890> works<00:03:10.100> pretty<00:03:10.340> good<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.569> thing

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
see it works pretty good the one thing

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.289 
see it works pretty good the one thing
that<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:12.709> little<00:03:12.830> bit<00:03:13.190> more<00:03:13.430> reassuring<00:03:14.180> as

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
that is a little bit more reassuring as

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.490 
that is a little bit more reassuring as
the<00:03:14.450> click<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.049> actually<00:03:15.350> doesn't

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the click so it actually doesn't

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.910 
the click so it actually doesn't
activate<00:03:16.100> until<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.489> click<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.000> we're<00:03:17.660> on<00:03:17.920> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
activate until you click it we're on the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.539 
activate until you click it we're on the
oneplus<00:03:19.459> 2<00:03:20.109> as<00:03:21.109> soon<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.739> touch<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.280> it

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
oneplus 2 as soon as you touch this it

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.099 
oneplus 2 as soon as you touch this it
actually<00:03:22.760> activates<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.600> don't<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.959> this

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
actually activates so I don't have this

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.720 
actually activates so I don't have this
finger<00:03:24.470> program<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.100> won't<00:03:25.220> even<00:03:25.340> turn<00:03:25.579> on

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
finger program so it won't even turn on

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.849 
finger program so it won't even turn on
the<00:03:25.850> display<00:03:26.209> but<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.079> put<00:03:27.260> my<00:03:27.380> thumb<00:03:27.620> here

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
the display but if I put my thumb here

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.509 
the display but if I put my thumb here
again<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:30.109> wakes<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.500> up<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:30.890> it's<00:03:31.040> really<00:03:31.220> nice

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
again it wakes it up so it's really nice

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.539 
again it wakes it up so it's really nice
it<00:03:31.820> works<00:03:32.000> most<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.109> time<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.799> I've

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
it works most of the time and I've

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.880 
it works most of the time and I've
programmed<00:03:34.970> both<00:03:35.720> thumbs<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.620> finger

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
programmed both thumbs and this finger

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.550 
programmed both thumbs and this finger
here<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.579> test<00:03:37.910> into<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.630> phone<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.200> I

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
here for this test into the phone and I

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.949 
here for this test into the phone and I
think<00:03:39.829> it<00:03:39.920> works<00:03:40.070> really<00:03:40.340> well<00:03:40.600> both<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.660> them

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
think it works really well both of them

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.259 
think it works really well both of them
are<00:03:42.109> not<00:03:42.260> 100%<00:03:42.709> perfect<00:03:43.190> like<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.670> said<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.209> I

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
are not 100% perfect like I said and I

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.910 
are not 100% perfect like I said and I
would<00:03:44.329> love<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.780> see<00:03:44.959> future<00:03:45.230> improvements

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
would love to see future improvements

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.400 
would love to see future improvements
and<00:03:46.010> I'm<00:03:46.130> sure<00:03:46.730> that'll<00:03:46.970> come<00:03:47.269> at<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.109> time

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
and I'm sure that'll come at this time

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.530 
and I'm sure that'll come at this time
both<00:03:48.709> fingerprint<00:03:49.340> readers<00:03:49.609> are<00:03:49.820> very<00:03:50.239> very

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
both fingerprint readers are very very

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.020 
both fingerprint readers are very very
good<00:03:50.890> obviously<00:03:51.890> it<00:03:52.040> looks<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.670> oneplus

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
good obviously it looks like the oneplus

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.610 
good obviously it looks like the oneplus
2<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.390> little<00:03:53.810> bit<00:03:53.959> quicker<00:03:54.230> than<00:03:54.380> the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
2 is a little bit quicker than the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.160 
2 is a little bit quicker than the
iPhone<00:03:55.010> 6<00:03:55.310> plus<00:03:55.459> at<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.880> point<00:03:56.180> but<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:56.989> one

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
iPhone 6 plus at this point but this one

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.599 
iPhone 6 plus at this point but this one
you<00:03:57.200> actually<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.769> physically<00:03:58.190> click<00:03:58.459> in

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
you actually have to physically click in

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.670 
you actually have to physically click in
order<00:03:58.700> for<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.090> activate<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.720> both<00:04:00.410> have

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
order for it to activate so both have

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.170 
order for it to activate so both have
their<00:04:00.859> advantages<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.459> disadvantages

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
their advantages and disadvantages

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.000 
their advantages and disadvantages
they're<00:04:02.390> both<00:04:02.540> using<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:03.230> guess<00:04:03.739> similar

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
they're both using I guess similar

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.160 
they're both using I guess similar
technology<00:04:04.760> but<00:04:05.000> supposedly<00:04:05.390> Apple<00:04:05.870> holds

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
technology but supposedly Apple holds

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.720 
technology but supposedly Apple holds
the<00:04:06.290> patent<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:06.950> way<00:04:07.040> they're<00:04:07.280> doing<00:04:07.430> it

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
the patent on the way they're doing it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
the patent on the way they're doing it
so<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.150> could<00:04:08.299> be<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.450> little<00:04:08.600> different<00:04:09.019> but<00:04:09.170> I

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
so it could be a little different but I

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.099 
so it could be a little different but I
love<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.430> idea<00:04:10.459> of<00:04:10.970> all<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.209> my<00:04:11.450> phones<00:04:11.720> having

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
love the idea of all of my phones having

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.629 
love the idea of all of my phones having
this<00:04:12.230> fingerprint<00:04:12.799> reader<00:04:12.980> that's<00:04:13.280> stored

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
this fingerprint reader that's stored

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.140 
this fingerprint reader that's stored
securely<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.980> basically<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.370> can<00:04:16.669> unlock<00:04:16.940> my

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
securely and basically I can unlock my

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.759 
securely and basically I can unlock my
phone<00:04:17.359> with<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.660> without<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.900> long<00:04:18.169> password

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
phone with it without a long password

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.500 
phone with it without a long password
having<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.310> enter<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.700> every<00:04:19.940> single<00:04:20.150> time<00:04:20.450> I

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
having to enter that every single time I

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.180 
having to enter that every single time I
can<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:20.959> put<00:04:21.080> my<00:04:21.200> thumb<00:04:21.409> on<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.769> unlocks

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
can just put my thumb on it it unlocks

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.430 
can just put my thumb on it it unlocks
it's<00:04:22.760> really<00:04:23.180> nice<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:23.599> great<00:04:23.750> for<00:04:23.990> payments

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
it's really nice it's great for payments

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.070 
it's really nice it's great for payments
on<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> eye

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
on the eye

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.290 
on the eye
and<00:04:25.530> when<00:04:26.129> they<00:04:26.250> start<00:04:26.490> integrating<00:04:27.000> more<00:04:27.150> and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
and when they start integrating more and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.029 
and when they start integrating more and
more<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.569> with<00:04:27.930> NFC<00:04:28.229> although<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
more of that with NFC although the

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.950 
more of that with NFC although the
oneplus<00:04:29.370> 2<00:04:29.580> doesn't<00:04:29.879> have<00:04:30.030> NFC<00:04:30.330> when<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.780> see

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
oneplus 2 doesn't have NFC when you see

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.110 
oneplus 2 doesn't have NFC when you see
this<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.289> other<00:04:31.440> devices<00:04:31.860> more<00:04:32.819> and<00:04:32.940> more

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
this in other devices more and more

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.510 
this in other devices more and more
it'll<00:04:33.300> be<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.509> really<00:04:34.259> nice<00:04:34.530> way<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:35.099> able<00:04:35.310> to

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
it'll be a really nice way to be able to

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.760 
it'll be a really nice way to be able to
pay<00:04:35.699> for<00:04:35.729> things<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.409> iPhone

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
pay for things and it is on the iPhone

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.879 
pay for things and it is on the iPhone
now<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:38.310> that's<00:04:39.240> definitely<00:04:39.539> a<00:04:40.139> great<00:04:40.770> thing

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
now so that's definitely a great thing

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.219 
now so that's definitely a great thing
in<00:04:41.280> my<00:04:41.430> opinion<00:04:41.879> for<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.210> future<00:04:42.539> for<00:04:43.080> those
