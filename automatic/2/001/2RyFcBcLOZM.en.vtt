brought to a really fine tight flame and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.369

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the surface of the mortar and you can

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.279 
the surface of the mortar and you can

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
imagine that if you had a mortar and you

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.680 
imagine that if you had a mortar and you
did<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> wouldn't<00:01:02.850> take<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.449> long

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699 
it only takes a small amount of diesel
fuel<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.000> fire<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.450> laser<00:02:09.660> long<00:02:10.110> enough<00:02:10.500> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
fuel to fire the laser long enough to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.950 
fuel to fire the laser long enough to
destroy<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.340> mortar<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
destroy a mortar and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.350 
destroy a mortar and
so<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.380> only<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:16.230> system<00:02:17.360> very

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so not only is this system very

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.630 
so not only is this system very
high-tech<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.740> also<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.130> cost

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
high-tech but it's also very cost

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.660 
high-tech but it's also very cost
effective<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.510> hard<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.870> find

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
effective and it's hard to find

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.500 
effective and it's hard to find
solutions<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.130> high-tech

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
solutions that have all of the high-tech

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.820 
solutions that have all of the high-tech
pushing<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> state-of-the-art<00:02:27.990> capability

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
pushing the state-of-the-art capability

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.860 
pushing the state-of-the-art capability
which<00:02:29.400> are<00:02:29.610> also<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.270> most<00:02:30.450> cost<00:02:30.690> effective

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
which are also the most cost effective

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.740 
which are also the most cost effective
solution
