any minutes or hours or whatever until
nine<00:03:39.959> o'clock<00:03:39.989> starts<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.370> what's

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
nine o'clock starts so it's like what's

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.340 
nine o'clock starts so it's like what's
the<00:03:41.670> point<00:03:41.760> in<00:03:42.030> doing<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.540> early<00:03:42.720> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
the point in doing it that early it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.069 
the point in doing it that early it
makes<00:03:43.620> no<00:03:43.709> sense<00:03:44.299> but<00:03:45.299> apparently<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.900> does

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
makes no sense but apparently it does

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.390 
makes no sense but apparently it does
make<00:03:46.290> sense<00:03:46.530> because<00:03:46.769> then<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.130> won't<00:03:47.220> forget

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
make sense because then you won't forget
