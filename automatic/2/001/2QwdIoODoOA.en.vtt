00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 What we do is put these jets together 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.760
 instead of throwing them away, we open them 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.040
 we cut them and we clean them and we go 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.820
 uniting as it appears there we go 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 sealing with heat sealer 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.279
 we insulating sleeping bags 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.310
 layers of rain you saw the importance of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.859
 this is a sum of wills 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 start from which you start to see 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.110
 in your house you are already thinking of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.430
 someone who needs it and then 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 we work in a workshop once per 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 different processes selection of sachets 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.780
 we are sealing them with that we sew them 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 everything and the finished product is finished 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.960
 a very good initiative and good work 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.210
 of recycling important in type that was 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 it is given a very important utility if 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.550
 that is mainly to preserve the environment 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 environment and at the same time is supportive because 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 we are using something that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.200
 and it's going to be discarded we turn it into something 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 that serves others for more people 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.549
 need we connect with other 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.920
 foundations to distribute this 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.590
