00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
comes to difficulty with this map I give

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
comes to difficulty with this map I give
this<00:01:07.979> map<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> 7<00:01:08.790> out<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> 10<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> reason

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this map a 7 out of 10 now the reason

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.750 
this map a 7 out of 10 now the reason
that<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> such<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> high<00:01:11.310> score

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that this is such a high score

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.640 
that this is such a high score
especially<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> survival<00:01:13.049> map<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.320> because

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
especially for a survival map is because

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
especially for a survival map is because
there's<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.100> many<00:01:14.280> challenges<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> map

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
there's so many challenges that the map

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
there's so many challenges that the map
maker<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.840> set<00:01:16.020> aside<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.590> many<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> them<00:01:17.310> are

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
maker is set aside and many of them are

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.800 
maker is set aside and many of them are
very<00:01:17.580> difficult<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
very difficult that if you're going to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
very difficult that if you're going to
try<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.960> complete<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> would<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
try to complete all of them it would be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
try to complete all of them it would be
very<00:01:20.490> tough<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> comes<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> rating<00:01:22.470> this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
very tough when it comes to rating this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
very tough when it comes to rating this
map<00:01:22.770> I'd<00:01:23.009> give<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.369> 4<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.820> 5<00:01:24.119> stars<00:01:24.479> which

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
map I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars which

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
map I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars which
is<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.259> pretty<00:01:25.590> conservative<00:01:26.070> review

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is actually a pretty conservative review

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
is actually a pretty conservative review
I'm<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.299> doing<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.869> let's<00:01:28.080> play<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I'm actually doing a let's play of this
