00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
it's got big clumps of clods of clay

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.020 
it's got big clumps of clods of clay
instead<00:00:45.409> of<00:00:45.500> very<00:00:45.710> little<00:00:45.890> pieces<00:00:46.220> plus

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
instead of very little pieces plus

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.250 
instead of very little pieces plus
there's<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.300> little<00:00:47.420> bit<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.629> grass<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:47.899> there

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
there's a little bit of grass in there

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.560 
there's a little bit of grass in there
and<00:00:48.469> makes<00:00:48.680> it<00:00:48.890> doesn't<00:00:49.850> bind<00:00:50.030> together<00:00:50.210> well

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
and makes it doesn't bind together well

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.299 
and makes it doesn't bind together well
but<00:00:51.110> it's<00:00:51.230> good<00:00:51.410> soil<00:00:51.680> if<00:00:51.829> we<00:00:51.949> dig<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.160> little

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
but it's good soil if we dig a little

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.420 
but it's good soil if we dig a little
deeper<00:00:52.899> so<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.649> we've<00:00:54.770> been<00:00:54.859> talking<00:00:55.070> about

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430

something<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.570> marching<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.740> rolling<00:02:40.740> over<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
something so marching is rolling over it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.800 
something so marching is rolling over it
a<00:02:41.220> few<00:02:41.370> times<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.120> else<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.570> can<00:02:42.630> get

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
a few times to see what else you can get

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.810 
a few times to see what else you can get
out<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.230> keep<00:02:44.130> trying<00:02:44.370> different<00:02:44.490> tools

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
out of it keep trying different tools

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.730 
out of it keep trying different tools
display<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.420> really<00:02:45.810> ideal<00:02:45.959> for<00:02:46.410> making<00:02:46.500> our

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
display is really ideal for making our

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.410 
display is really ideal for making our
bricks<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.700> we're<00:02:47.910> having<00:02:48.120> trouble<00:02:48.360> getting

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
bricks but we're having trouble getting

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.900 
bricks but we're having trouble getting
it<00:02:48.630> out<00:02:48.690> ground<00:02:49.400> we're<00:02:50.400> still<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.760> here

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
it out ground we're still out here

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.640 
it out ground we're still out here
working<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.570> disco<00:02:51.930> right<00:02:52.140> now<00:02:52.350> what

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
working with the disco right now what

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.860 
working with the disco right now what
we've<00:02:52.800> done<00:02:53.040> has<00:02:53.310> changed<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.880> angle<00:02:54.120> here

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
we've done has changed the angle here

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.070 
we've done has changed the angle here
we've<00:02:55.500> got<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.890> front<00:02:56.130> disc<00:02:56.459> ER<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.870> back

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.710 
the site so what we're going to do is
we're<00:04:42.890> going<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.070> use<00:04:43.190> this<00:04:43.370> fly<00:04:43.610> ash<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.600> is

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
we're going to use this fly ash that is

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.210 
we're going to use this fly ash that is
on<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.930> ground<00:04:45.050> now<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.470> order<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.710> disable<00:04:46.010> s

you<00:04:49.850> know<00:04:49.940> we've<00:04:50.090> got<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.240> seven<00:04:50.690> foot<00:04:50.810> four

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
you know we've got to seven foot four

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.540 
you know we've got to seven foot four
inch<00:04:51.140> sides<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.860> we're<00:04:51.950> gonna<00:04:52.040> hope<00:04:52.250> between

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
inch sides and we're gonna hope between

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.890 
inch sides and we're gonna hope between
them<00:04:52.700> with<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.880> heavy<00:04:53.030> hoe<00:04:53.210> over<00:04:53.360> here<00:04:53.660> and

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
them with the heavy hoe over here and

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.750 
them with the heavy hoe over here and
we're<00:04:54.440> gonna<00:04:54.500> mix<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.100> flash<00:04:55.340> into<00:04:55.670> the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
we're gonna mix the flash into the

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040 
we're gonna mix the flash into the
ground<00:04:56.030> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.630> rain<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:56.870> going<00:04:56.960> to

ground and then the rain is going to
come<00:04:57.170> down<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.500> harder<00:04:57.770> for<00:04:57.980> us<00:04:58.010> that's

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
come down and harder for us that's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.610 
come down and harder for us that's
basically<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:59.240> very<00:04:59.660> simple<00:04:59.990> method<00:05:00.350> for

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
basically a very simple method for

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.140 
basically a very simple method for
stabilizing<00:05:01.310> our<00:05:01.340> foundation<00:05:01.820> along<00:05:01.970> the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
stabilizing our foundation along the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.500 
stabilizing our foundation along the
perimeter<00:05:02.870> without<00:05:03.140> being<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.410> lot<00:05:03.530> of<00:05:03.620> cash

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
perimeter without being a lot of cash

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.320 
perimeter without being a lot of cash
right<00:05:05.510> here's<00:05:05.660> Alex<00:05:06.050> wrapping<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.650> up<00:05:06.770> just

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
right here's Alex wrapping it up just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.050 
right here's Alex wrapping it up just
got<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.390> guide<00:05:08.630> board<00:05:09.760> sprinkles<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> little

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
got a guide board sprinkles a little

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.910 
got a guide board sprinkles a little
seam<00:05:11.420> inches<00:05:11.780> ash<00:05:14.350> which<00:05:15.350> will<00:05:15.560> then<00:05:15.680> be

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
seam inches ash which will then be

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.100 
seam inches ash which will then be
lightly<00:05:16.850> mixed<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.420> you<00:05:17.510> can<00:05:17.660> see<00:05:17.780> on<00:05:17.810> some<00:05:18.050> of

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
lightly mixed as you can see on some of

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:29.380 
lightly mixed as you can see on some of
these<00:05:18.170> last<00:05:18.440> ones

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390
