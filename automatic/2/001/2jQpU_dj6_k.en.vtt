it<00:03:20.579> took<00:03:20.819> quite<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.180> bit<00:03:21.750> i<00:03:21.780> was<00:03:21.959> quite<00:03:22.230> hard<00:03:22.409> to

it took quite a bit i was quite hard to
take<00:03:22.859> out<00:03:23.069> i<00:03:24.030> guess<00:03:24.390> it's<00:03:25.079> better<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.069> they

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
take out i guess it's better so they

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.530 
take out i guess it's better so they
