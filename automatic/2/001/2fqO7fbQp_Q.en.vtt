00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.139 

so<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.220> think<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.580> first<00:00:02.790> thing<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.060> going

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so I think the first thing we're going

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.800 
so I think the first thing we're going
to<00:00:03.210> start<00:00:03.330> out<00:00:03.600> with<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:05.660> because<00:00:06.660> we're

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
to start out with here is because we're

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.960 
to start out with here is because we're
adding<00:00:07.080> these<00:00:07.170> extra<00:00:07.350> USB<00:00:07.950> ports<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.700> need<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
adding these extra USB ports we need to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.440 
adding these extra USB ports we need to
mark<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:11.000> backplate<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:14.269> for<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
mark the backplate for for the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.090 
mark the backplate for for the
additional<00:00:15.870> holes<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> hold

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
additional holes which are going to hold

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220 
additional holes which are going to hold
the<00:00:17.220> USB<00:00:17.580> ports<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> mark<00:00:19.109> this

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the USB ports so I'm going to mark this

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
the USB ports so I'm going to mark this
right<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:20.210> wait<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> center<00:00:21.930> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
right here wait about in the center of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.349 
right here wait about in the center of
that<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.699> what<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> center<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that and what about in the center of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.240 
that and what about in the center of
that<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.050> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> we're<00:00:26.220> going

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that and then we're going to we're going

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
that and then we're going to we're going
to<00:00:26.369> drill<00:00:26.640> those<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.840> plenty<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to drill those so that we have plenty of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.599 
to drill those so that we have plenty of
space<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> USB<00:00:28.949> ports<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
space for the USB ports one of the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.890 
space for the USB ports one of the
things<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> makes<00:00:30.150> easier<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.689> drilling

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
things that makes easier when drilling

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.630 
things that makes easier when drilling
this<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.560> an<00:00:31.710> awl<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.489> type

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this is to use an awl or some other type

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.090 
this is to use an awl or some other type
of<00:00:32.669> sharp<00:00:33.000> device<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:34.020> score<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> metal<00:00:34.739> where

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
of sharp device to score the metal where

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.360 
of sharp device to score the metal where
you<00:00:35.280> want<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.730> start<00:00:36.540> drilling<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.190> that's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you want to start drilling and so that's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.860 
you want to start drilling and so that's
what<00:00:38.489> I've<00:00:38.579> done<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> backplate

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
what I've done here so the backplate

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
what I've done here so the backplate
connector<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.920> scored<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.850> our<00:00:42.000> new

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
connector is now scored with our new

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
connector is now scored with our new
holes<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.559> we're<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.010> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
holes and what we're going to do is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.650 
holes and what we're going to do is
quickly<00:00:45.260> fish<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:46.530> things<00:00:47.570> through<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
quickly fish these things through the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.060 
quickly fish these things through the
grommets<00:00:49.020> ahead<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> time<00:00:49.469> it'll<00:00:49.710> save<00:00:49.860> us<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
grommets ahead of time it'll save us a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
grommets ahead of time it'll save us a
little<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> us<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:51.449> time<00:00:51.660> pushing<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
little bit of us some time pushing the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.189 
little bit of us some time pushing the
stuff<00:00:52.410> through<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.829> rather<00:00:53.039> close<00:00:54.030> fit<00:00:54.329> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
stuff through it's rather close fit just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.910 
stuff through it's rather close fit just
because<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> don't<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> lot<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> play<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
because you don't want a lot of play and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.349 
because you don't want a lot of play and
room<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.129> dust<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> other<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.210> in

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
room for dust and other things to get in

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450 
room for dust and other things to get in
so<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.809> pretty<00:01:00.989> pretty<00:01:01.739> tight<00:01:02.010> fit<00:01:02.250> where

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so it's pretty pretty tight fit where

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.000 
so it's pretty pretty tight fit where
you<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.730> want<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> squeeze<00:01:03.420> these

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
you really want to squeeze these

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.880 
you really want to squeeze these
connectors<00:01:05.010> through<00:01:05.280> ahead<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:06.890> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
connectors through ahead of time so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.969 
connectors through ahead of time so
these<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.000> our<00:01:09.119> new<00:01:09.240> hole<00:01:09.979> leaving

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
these go through our new hole leaving

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820 
these go through our new hole leaving
the<00:01:11.250> connectors<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> outside<00:01:12.840> obviously

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the connectors on the outside obviously

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.240 
the connectors on the outside obviously
of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> plate<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.159> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
of the plate this is you can put this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.460 
of the plate this is you can put this
plate<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> only<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.720> way<00:01:18.930> you've<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.350> this

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
plate on only one way you've got this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.859 
plate on only one way you've got this
little<00:01:19.619> metal<00:01:20.369> piece<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.750> only

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
little metal piece here so you can only

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
little metal piece here so you can only
put<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.200> plate<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.740> way<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:26.580> gets

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
put that plate on one way so that gets

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
put that plate on one way so that gets
mounted<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:28.189> we'll<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.280> another<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.640> right

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
mounted there we'll do another one right

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:42.540 
mounted there we'll do another one right
over<00:01:29.880> here

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.480 

all<00:01:43.150> right

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
all right

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.649 
all right
so<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:47.360> installed<00:01:50.240> four<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.450> USB

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
so now we have installed four more USB

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
so now we have installed four more USB
ports<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.670> we'll<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.880> set<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.119> aside<00:01:54.270> over

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
ports and we'll just set this aside over

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.370 
ports and we'll just set this aside over
here<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.200> now

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.780 

in<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.500> case

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.310 

there<00:02:06.390> are<00:02:07.460> two<00:02:08.460> screws<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.420> each<00:02:09.720> side<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
there are two screws on each side and

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020 
there are two screws on each side and
three<00:02:10.530> screws<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.009> back<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> think

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
three screws on the back so I think

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.990 
three screws on the back so I think
we'll<00:02:12.270> fast<00:02:12.510> forward<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
we'll fast forward here so that you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160 
we'll fast forward here so that you
don't<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.480> bored<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:15.930> screw

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
don't have to be bored with screw

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
don't have to be bored with screw
openings<00:02:17.150> next<00:02:18.150> piece<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> come<00:02:18.570> out<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:21.600> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
openings next piece to come out is the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.210 
openings next piece to come out is the
hard<00:02:21.990> drive<00:02:22.140> bracket<00:02:22.530> we're<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.160> to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
hard drive bracket we're going to

surface to put this on I'm going to use

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.340 
surface to put this on I'm going to use
a<00:03:02.010> spare<00:03:02.400> case<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.090> really<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.750> general

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
a spare case here you really in general

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.840 
a spare case here you really in general
wouldn't<00:03:04.770> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.100> use<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.459> these<00:03:05.580> cases

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
wouldn't want to use one of these cases

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.400 
wouldn't want to use one of these cases
to<00:03:06.000> avoid<00:03:06.180> scratching<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.080> happen<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.320> have

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
to avoid scratching but I happen to have

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.300 
to avoid scratching but I happen to have
a<00:03:07.500> spare<00:03:07.770> one<00:03:07.890> here<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> bench<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.870> then

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
a spare one here on the bench and then

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.440 
a spare one here on the bench and then
when<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.400> use<00:03:11.519> our<00:03:11.700> screw<00:03:12.390> kit<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:15.030> came<00:03:15.300> with

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
when I use our screw kit it came with

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.009 
when I use our screw kit it came with
the<00:03:15.540> case<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:17.190> screw<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.610> hard<00:03:17.760> drive<00:03:18.019> now

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
the case to screw in the hard drive now

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.020 
the case to screw in the hard drive now
it's<00:03:19.170> time<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.530> go<00:03:20.430> ahead<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.730> mount<00:03:20.820> this

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it's time to go ahead and mount this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.560 
it's time to go ahead and mount this
motherboard<00:03:21.299> so<00:03:21.810> let's<00:03:21.959> do<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:23.390> before<00:03:24.390> with

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
motherboard so let's do that before with

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.880 
motherboard so let's do that before with
these<00:03:24.720> motherboards<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.320> course<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.799> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
these motherboards of course we have to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.039 
these motherboards of course we have to
put<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.780> back<00:03:27.780> plate

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.690 

so<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.140> ps2<00:03:31.560> connectors<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.340> decide<00:03:32.579> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
so the ps2 connectors if you decide to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.860 
so the ps2 connectors if you decide to
use<00:03:32.819> them<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.180> over<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.480> get<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.689> red

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
use them go over and you get this red

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.780 
use them go over and you get this red
power<00:03:34.079> switch<00:03:39.230> okay<00:03:40.459> we're<00:03:41.459> going<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.609> pull

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
power switch okay we're going to pull

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.940 
power switch okay we're going to pull
these<00:03:41.969> out<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.659> to<00:03:43.109> give<00:03:43.290> me<00:03:43.379> plenty<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> room

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
these out just to give me plenty of room

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.550 
these out just to give me plenty of room
to<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.659> motherboard<00:03:46.049> in<00:03:46.140> here<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.500> very

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
to get the motherboard in here it's very

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.890 
to get the motherboard in here it's very
very<00:03:48.409> tight<00:03:49.970> fit<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.030> get<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.390> motherboard<00:03:51.810> in

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
very tight fit to get the motherboard in

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.229 
very tight fit to get the motherboard in
we<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.349> about<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.620> millimeter<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.099> spare<00:03:53.549> so

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
we have about a millimeter to spare so

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.250 
we have about a millimeter to spare so
this<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:54.659> of<00:03:54.689> those<00:03:54.810> things<00:03:55.049> where<00:03:55.200> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
this is one of those things where you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.539 
this is one of those things where you
just<00:03:55.290> have<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.959> patient<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.430> go

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
just have to to be patient when you go

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.729 
just have to to be patient when you go
to<00:03:59.609> install<00:03:59.819> this<00:04:02.629> take<00:04:03.629> your<00:04:03.780> time<00:04:04.019> make<00:04:04.680> sure

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
to install this take your time make sure

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.220 
to install this take your time make sure
everything<00:04:05.159> is<00:04:05.189> lined<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:07.159> just<00:04:09.230> slowly

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
everything is lined up and just slowly

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.140 
everything is lined up and just slowly
push<00:04:11.010> this<00:04:11.220> thing<00:04:11.400> into<00:04:11.549> place

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
push this thing into place

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.009 
push this thing into place
and<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:13.319> should<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.560> fall<00:04:13.889> right<00:04:14.129> in<00:04:17.599> so<00:04:18.599> this

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
and it should just fall right in so this

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.870 
and it should just fall right in so this
plastic<00:04:19.590> plate<00:04:19.829> holds<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.280> motherboard<00:04:20.669> out

an<00:04:21.150> extra<00:04:22.139> millimeter<00:04:22.560> or<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.699> first

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
an extra millimeter or so so the first

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.510 
an extra millimeter or so so the first
screw<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.330> a<00:04:24.360> little<00:04:24.630> tricky<00:04:25.220> find<00:04:26.220> something

going to use this printer port now to

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.730 
going to use this printer port now to
line<00:04:53.880> this<00:04:54.090> hole<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.900> one<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.409> important

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
things with using pushing on the back of

things with using pushing on the back of
these<00:04:57.870> ports<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.440> keep<00:04:59.280> things<00:04:59.490> aligned

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
these ports to keep things aligned

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.480 
these ports to keep things aligned
there's<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.620> bunch<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.740> pins<00:05:01.949> here<00:05:02.280> and<00:05:02.430> you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
there's a bunch of pins here and you

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.409 
there's a bunch of pins here and you
really<00:05:02.699> don't<00:05:02.849> want<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.000> push<00:05:03.150> on<00:05:03.300> them

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
really don't want to push on them

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.939 
really don't want to push on them
they're<00:05:03.870> really<00:05:03.960> sensitive<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.710> want<00:05:04.889> to

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
they're really sensitive so you want to

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.899 
they're really sensitive so you want to
find<00:05:05.699> something<00:05:05.909> rigid<00:05:06.240> pushing<00:05:06.840> on<00:05:07.909> like

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
find something rigid pushing on like

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.210 
find something rigid pushing on like
like<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:10.080> plastic<00:05:10.650> that's<00:05:10.830> actually

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
like this plastic that's actually

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.250 
like this plastic that's actually
attached<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.820> motherboard<00:05:12.090> in<00:05:12.870> order<00:05:13.110> to

attached to the motherboard in order to

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.999 
attached to the motherboard in order to
align<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.680> holes

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:34.820 

all<00:05:17.520> right<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:19.229> get<00:05:19.349> two<00:05:19.529> more<00:05:19.680> screws

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.300 

well<00:05:35.430> here

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
well here

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.750

and<00:05:37.639> one<00:05:38.300> here<00:05:41.800> while<00:05:42.800> we're<00:05:43.010> at<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.100> we're

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
and one here while we're at it we're

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.000 
and one here while we're at it we're
going<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:43.940> go<00:05:44.060> ahead<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.300> plug<00:05:44.480> in<00:05:44.510> our<00:05:48.010> case

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
going to go ahead and plug in our case

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.440 
going to go ahead and plug in our case
fan<00:05:49.370> right<00:05:49.639> now<00:05:49.700> into<00:05:50.120> the<00:05:50.210> motherboard

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
fan right now into the motherboard

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.540 
fan right now into the motherboard
header<00:05:52.270> now<00:05:53.270> it's<00:05:53.419> time
