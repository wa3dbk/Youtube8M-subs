00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 today we are going to prepare this 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 valuable vegetable as we inform ourselves 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 previously in a very 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.500
 fun that the guys are going to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.080
 love honestly if we're going to do 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 a milanesa of zucchini we 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.900
 generally the Milanese 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 we make it fried is not true at home if 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 we take him fry and fill with more 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.449
 Fat of things that are not going to help us 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.369
 in our health then today I have 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 brought in this way because to the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.420
 guys love Milanese is not 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 true if you ask your daughters 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 also love yes of course but 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 let's see how we are left with the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.230
 zucchini 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 It's very good, I recommend that you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 do not even imagine that it's a 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 vegetable is delicious I think cantito 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.980
 you can not imagine and how 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.860
 always with very little fat we're going 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.260
 to perform this time look for the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.079
 elaboration of this good Milanese here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 We have our star ingredient not 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.870
 what is the zucchini if we are going to cut it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.180
 in little sticks 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490
 we are going to cut it because we are going to divide it 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.950
 in three parts the zucchini is very 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.400
 versatile in the preparation we can 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 prepare from a zucchini soup 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
 generally here we get them in a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.230
 very big super giant presentation 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.570
 then those then serve us to make 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.350
 a cream of his chemistry is very similar 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 delicious yes or no, well, we are going to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 doing in this way is a way that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 the kids learn to eat because in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.190
 true they usually see a vegetable 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 new and do not even want to try it is not 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.800
 but this way they're going 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.290
 to test if for this we have as 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.500
 all the Milanese we do not true 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.740
 let's have bread crumbs beaten egg 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 yes and a flour that in this case the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.870
 we have brought corn yes then always 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 that we use a carbohydrate 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.360
 let's try that carbohydrate that is not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 an empty carbohydrate does not have its 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.619
 vitamins and that's what I have 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.410
 used instead of common flour as a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.080
 cornmeal 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.570
 and then let's catch good 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.370
 first we are going to pepper them 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.800
 we put a little salt so that 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.070
 they are so bland, it's not true 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.940
 to put salt and pepper if we're going to 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.980
 salpimentar well and after that we are going to 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 proceed to make our rich Milanese 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.030
 look and we take a stick we passed 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 for cornmeal 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.960
 and now you'll see in the breadcrumbs 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.090
 it's not true we have here a 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.400
 little friend of bread to this little friend of bread 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.020
 we are also going to enrich him, I think 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.720
 that this is the most good way to 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.580
 implement foods generally 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.470
 the guys do not like look at this 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.220
 little bread crumbs us we will 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.550
 to put this is the sprouted wheat if you 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.010
 let's put a little bit of aroma with 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.470
 that oregano cumin what we like for 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.980
 seasoning a rich meat is not true 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.410
 we are going to put these magazines that is the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.870
 sesame seeds are already toasted 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.180
 enrich our Milanese is not true 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.790
 we will put more nutrients look 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.730
 that's what I think is the tip of all 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.310
 for our kids to learn to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.460
 eat if we are very creative you 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.880
 let's put salt yes and we're also going 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.590
 to put a little parmesan cheese 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.690
 It will give us a very rich taste 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.880
 this is this mixture we can 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.520
 do it to do even the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.340
 Milanese with animal protein 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.820
 you really can not imagine the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.010
 taste and how rich is this other and 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.750
 all the nutrients you have see that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.280
 We are not only using the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.710
 empty carbohydrate is not true that 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.600
 it would be the crumb of bread already now yes already 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.820
 ready our ingredients we are going to 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.980
 do the following we put for the flour 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.410
 we put for the egg and for our bread 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.630
 which is the same and we put in a 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.220
 insert to bake while 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.820
 we prepare this we already have 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.820
 our nito already preheated yes and the 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.549
 let's go through the flour 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.140
 the little egg is like any Milanese not 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.380
 it is true that we do it but in this 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.910
 we are going to do it with silvera 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.120
 Maurizio to come and help us for the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.060
 another will put the Caribbean 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.640
 a little patience but look is not 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.950
 they will regret it is very rich and 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.760
 the guys just look at them they say wow 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.760
 what is that 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.400
 Mauricio good for you to go there for the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.530
 for the cornmeal mouth help me to 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.229
 do 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.729
 Look, it 's super simple, super easy, and 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.729
 we are ready mix 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:01.139
 Let's see what we are going to do to Mauricio 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.359
 so that if he keeps doing while 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.179
 while he is and he continues to give us the 

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:08.519
 there in the little egg and then in the 

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:11.429
 grated bread that we have enriched with 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:13.799
 many more ingredients is not true anymore 

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:16.169
 then we already have are not armed 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:24.509
 Milanesas, we are going to bake them 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:26.789
 ready and whore is good more or less the 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.799
 fingers but hey worth I believe in 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.159
 when we have to taste it, look 

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.899
 not only with we bake them at 180 degrees 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.479
 only for 10 minutes do not delay 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.639
 more if it's just to make them brown 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.649
 look at the time we put them in the oven 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.229
 we varnish them with a little 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.029
 of olive oil or oil that 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.039
 we have at home it is not true that 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:51.299
 master varnish is only for you to give 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.549
 the little color of how it was fried 

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:55.639
 it's not true that's it's only 

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:58.499
 look, we made a milanesa 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.729
 enriched we have made a Milanese very 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:02.729
 delicious 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.520
 zero fat or is not fried look like this 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.830
 As I tell you, it is my suggestion 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.900
 do it like this the chicken do or the fish 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.240
 do they were not going to have very good 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.979
 results and we will not charge you 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.349
 fat is not true that it is that now in 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.330
 a row we show look here is a 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.669
 very good way to help our 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.969
 children to incorporate therefore this vegetable 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.599
 which is very kind and very beneficial 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:30.689
 to bid was the final result 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.249
 leave I do not know if the phone number like 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.930
 always the address because I know there are 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.699
 many people look here sung to 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.740
 be with you and visit visit here 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.229
 we have those milanesas already 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.539
 made and how you can see them 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.339
 look very appetizing if you always 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.139
 we accompany of course a rich 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.580
 salad and how I see that here she is 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.430
 set the whole Christmas atmosphere 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.479
 well my salad did not have to be less 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.550
 do not talk to a Christmas live 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.199
 and here we have brought for people who from 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.870
 soon they are on diet and one actually 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.550
 you can not consume carbohydrates here 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.039
 are these zucchinis the same 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.120
 zucchinis only enrich a 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.790
 shortly before 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.090
 of olive oil oil in a 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.430
 pan will heat up we put a agito 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.830
 a few pieces of chili and sauté 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.780
 three minutes and the inti is ready 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.580
 look at us this way, if we are 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.240
 on a diet then we can also 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.530
 consume it is very delicious and you 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.530
 I recommend that they do
