exciting way one of the things that I
enjoy<00:01:04.680> most<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.090> particular<00:01:06.750> brush

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
enjoy most about this particular brush

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070 
enjoy most about this particular brush
is<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.060> call<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> diffusion

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is that it has what we call a diffusion

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.070 
is that it has what we call a diffusion
and<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> wet<00:01:10.890> fringe<00:01:11.310> setting<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> within

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and a wet fringe setting and within

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
and a wet fringe setting and within
these<00:01:13.380> settings<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
these settings you can actually get this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.280 
these settings you can actually get this
brush<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> behave<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.580> traditional

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
brush to behave in a very traditional

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
brush to behave in a very traditional
fashion<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:20.280> other<00:01:20.460> thing<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:20.939> nice

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fashion the other thing that's nice

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.840 
fashion the other thing that's nice
about<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> brush<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.890> paint<00:01:23.640> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
about it is the brush will paint on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.780 
about it is the brush will paint on
either<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.270> canvas<00:01:24.750> layer<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.790> additional

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
either the canvas layer or additional

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.350 
either the canvas layer or additional
layers<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.720> forward<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> let's<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
layers as you go forward so let's take a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.569 
layers as you go forward so let's take a
look<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.720> some<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> attributes<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.070> have

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
look at some of the attributes I have

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.300 
look at some of the attributes I have
chosen<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.689> brush<00:01:33.930> called<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> new<00:01:34.680> simple

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
chosen the brush called the new simple

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
chosen the brush called the new simple
water<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.030> you'll<00:01:36.720> notice<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> has<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
water and you'll notice that it has a

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
water and you'll notice that it has a
grain<00:01:38.250> setting<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:39.000> means<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
grain setting which means that it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
grain setting which means that it
basically<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.560> react<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> paper

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
basically will react to the paper

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.899 
basically will react to the paper
texture<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.890> select<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.640> more

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
texture that you select so the more

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
texture that you select so the more
paper<00:01:45.270> tech<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> lower<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.590> grain

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
paper tech or the lower the grain

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
paper tech or the lower the grain
setting<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:47.850> texture<00:01:48.479> we're<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
setting the more texture we're going to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
setting the more texture we're going to
see<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.159> increase<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:51.079> grain

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
see and as we increase this grain

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
see and as we increase this grain
setting<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.890> paper<00:01:53.340> texture<00:01:53.790> becomes<00:01:54.299> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
setting the paper texture becomes a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780 
setting the paper texture becomes a
little<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:54.720> refined<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:56.219> quite<00:01:56.549> as

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
little more refined and not quite as

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.889 
little more refined and not quite as
visible<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> actual<00:01:58.530> brush<00:01:58.860> stroke<00:01:59.899> I've

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
visible in the actual brush stroke I've

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
visible in the actual brush stroke I've
gone<00:02:01.110> ahead<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.469> laid<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.100> few<00:02:02.340> brush

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
gone ahead and laid in a few brush

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.330 
gone ahead and laid in a few brush
strokes<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
strokes and you can see that in the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.180 
strokes and you can see that in the
default<00:02:05.790> state<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> brush<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.290> very

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
soft edge with just a little

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.729 
soft edge with just a little
a bit<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.920> wet<00:02:14.160> fringe<00:02:14.520> applied<00:02:15.739> however

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
a bit of wet fringe applied however

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.280 
a bit of wet fringe applied however
let's<00:02:17.130> say<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> continue<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.170> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
let's say I want to continue with this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.729 
let's say I want to continue with this
painting<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.250> paint<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.910> sky<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.270> has<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
painting and paint in a sky that has you

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.979 
painting and paint in a sky that has you
know<00:02:22.770> clouds<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.270> very<00:02:24.599> very

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
know clouds in it and has that very very

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.309 
know clouds in it and has that very very
soft<00:02:25.920> look<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:27.239> one<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> things<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.140> would

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
soft look so one of the things I would

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.259 
soft look so one of the things I would
do<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.800> would<00:02:29.010> be<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.220> increase<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
do here would be to increase the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.880 
do here would be to increase the
diffusion<00:02:30.870> setting<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.380> I'm<00:02:31.440> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> take

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
diffusion setting and I'm going to take

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.660 
diffusion setting and I'm going to take
it<00:02:32.010> all<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.250> way<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.819> 20<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.310> using<00:02:35.310> my<00:02:35.430> Alt

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it all the way up to 20 and using my Alt

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.180 
it all the way up to 20 and using my Alt
key<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.780> sample<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.410> blue

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
key I'm just going to sample a blue

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.360 
key I'm just going to sample a blue
value<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:40.620> over

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
value here and you can see as I go over

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.229 
value here and you can see as I go over
those<00:02:41.849> brush<00:02:42.269> strokes<00:02:42.500> how<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.730> paint<00:02:44.730> just

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
those brush strokes how the paint just

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.100 
those brush strokes how the paint just
softly<00:02:46.049> diffuses<00:02:46.830> on<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.280> edges<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.900> is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
softly diffuses on the edges and this is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.130 
softly diffuses on the edges and this is
you<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:50.480> really<00:02:51.480> one<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:54.260> traditional

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
you know really one of the traditional

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.380 
you know really one of the traditional
aspects<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.860> speak<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.430> watercolor<00:03:00.269> that

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
aspects so to speak of watercolor that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.990 
aspects so to speak of watercolor that
you<00:03:00.720> look<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:02.459> called<00:03:02.819> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
you look for you know it's called the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.140 
you look for you know it's called the
wet<00:03:03.569> on<00:03:03.750> wet<00:03:04.170> or<00:03:04.440> wet<00:03:04.830> into<00:03:05.220> wet<00:03:05.430> method<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
wet on wet or wet into wet method and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.920 
wet on wet or wet into wet method and
what<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> does<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.150> will

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
what it does is it just you know will

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.650 
what it does is it just you know will
take<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> paint<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.360> spread<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.390> out

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
take the paint and kind of spread it out

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.280 
take the paint and kind of spread it out
and<00:03:13.049> create<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.470> very<00:03:13.860> very<00:03:14.450> soft<00:03:15.450> appearance

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
and create a very very soft appearance

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.550 
and create a very very soft appearance
so<00:03:17.190> as<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.850> further<00:03:18.390> into<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.380> can

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so as I go further into this you can

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.479 
so as I go further into this you can
just<00:03:19.799> see<00:03:20.250> how<00:03:20.640> those<00:03:21.000> edges<00:03:21.769> just<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:23.310> are

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
just see how those edges just just are

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.789 
just see how those edges just just are
just<00:03:23.519> beautiful<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.359> just<00:03:24.780> soften<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.500> as<00:03:25.680> I

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
just beautiful and just soften up as I

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.610 
just beautiful and just soften up as I
go<00:03:25.829> through<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.579> this<00:03:27.120> means<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.870> can<00:03:28.230> even<00:03:28.380> go

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
go through and this means I can even go

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.670 
go through and this means I can even go
over<00:03:29.390> brushstrokes<00:03:30.390> I've<00:03:30.600> already<00:03:31.109> laid<00:03:31.350> in

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
over brushstrokes I've already laid in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.150 
over brushstrokes I've already laid in
and<00:03:32.030> have<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> little<00:03:33.269> fun<00:03:33.569> by<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:34.170> working<00:03:35.010> on

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and have a little fun by just working on

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.020 
and have a little fun by just working on
diffusing<00:03:35.819> some<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.180> those<00:03:36.299> edges<00:03:37.819> if<00:03:38.819> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
diffusing some of those edges if I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
diffusing some of those edges if I
wanted<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.739> increase<00:03:40.739> color<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.549> certain

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
wanted to increase color in certain

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.530 
wanted to increase color in certain
areas<00:03:42.329> I<00:03:42.540> could<00:03:42.600> certainly<00:03:42.959> do<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.540> for

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
areas I could certainly do that and for

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.720 
areas I could certainly do that and for
example<00:03:46.049> if<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.290> wanted<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> show<00:03:47.040> maybe<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
example if I wanted to show maybe the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.059 
example if I wanted to show maybe the
look<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.090> fog<00:03:48.389> coming<00:03:48.900> over<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.350> mountain<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
look of fog coming over this mountain I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.030 
look of fog coming over this mountain I
could<00:03:50.639> sample<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.540> lighter<00:03:51.840> value<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.889> and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
could sample the lighter value here and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.400 
could sample the lighter value here and
just<00:03:53.670> kind<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.000> float<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.600> over<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.109> top<00:03:55.380> of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
just kind of float it over the top of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.729 
just kind of float it over the top of
this<00:03:55.859> hill<00:03:56.160> side<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.819> just<00:03:57.630> softly<00:03:58.200> go<00:03:58.530> over

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
this hill side and just softly go over

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.150 
this hill side and just softly go over
those<00:03:58.889> edges<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.760> lose<00:04:00.150> those<00:04:00.359> edges<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
those edges to lose those edges and

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.250 
those edges to lose those edges and
create<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.310> really<00:04:02.579> soft<00:04:03.359> look<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.019> maybe

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
create that really soft look and maybe

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.160 
create that really soft look and maybe
that<00:04:04.530> look<00:04:04.769> of<00:04:04.950> fog<00:04:05.639> coming<00:04:06.060> in<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.109> is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
that look of fog coming in so this is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.410 
that look of fog coming in so this is
one<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:10.950> my<00:04:11.040> favorite<00:04:11.459> brushes<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.090> again

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
one of my favorite brushes and again

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.690 
one of my favorite brushes and again
within<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.109> digital<00:04:13.500> watercolor<00:04:14.130> you'll<00:04:14.430> see

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
within the digital watercolor you'll see

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
within the digital watercolor you'll see
quite<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.750> few<00:04:16.310> including<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.519> an<00:04:17.820> eraser<00:04:18.389> which

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
quite a few including a an eraser which

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.469 
quite a few including a an eraser which
is<00:04:18.930> nice<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.519> want<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.850> use<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.269> to

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
is nice if you want to use that to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.409 
is nice if you want to use that to
actually<00:04:21.510> lift<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.830> for<00:04:23.729> example<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.300> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
actually lift and for example if I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.240 
actually lift and for example if I
wanted<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.840> lift<00:04:25.080> out<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.349> look<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.919> some<00:04:26.159> way

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
wanted to lift out the look of some way

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.490
