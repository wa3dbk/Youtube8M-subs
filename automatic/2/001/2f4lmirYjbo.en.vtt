00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
pretty much using including himself so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
pretty much using including himself so
it's<00:01:37.380> basically<00:01:38.100> your<00:01:38.280> all-in<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.060> point

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it's basically your all-in at that point

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
it's basically your all-in at that point
if<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:40.170> discarding<00:01:40.530> cards<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
don't get effects with like for example

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.120 
don't get effects with like for example
um<00:01:44.570> something<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.869> Lyn<00:01:46.229> does<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.860> her

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
um something like a Lyn does not get her

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
um something like a Lyn does not get her
effect<00:01:47.460> when<00:01:47.610> she's<00:01:47.790> sent<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> graveyard

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
effect when she's sent to the graveyard

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
effect when she's sent to the graveyard
although<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> there's<00:01:50.040> gun<00:01:50.340> which

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
although you know there's gun which

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
although you know there's gun which
watch<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.360> her<00:01:51.509> effect<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
watch you get her effect in the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.200 
watch you get her effect in the
graveyard<00:01:52.229> uh<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.399> has<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.060> male

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
graveyard uh it has to be a more male

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
graveyard uh it has to be a more male
monster<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.780> can't<00:01:55.020> discard<00:01:55.290> something

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
monster so you can't discard something

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
monster so you can't discard something
like<00:01:55.710> Atlantean<00:01:56.579> marksmen<00:01:57.060> Atlantean<00:01:57.450> heavy

infantry all those Atlanta cards that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.429 
infantry all those Atlanta cards that
you<00:01:59.670> discard<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.360> can't<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:00.869> discard<00:02:01.290> them

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you discard you can't even discard them

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
you discard you can't even discard them
for<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> fail<00:02:02.579> well<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.479> he

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
for a fail well over here because he

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
for a fail well over here because he
simply<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.350> only<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.829> discarding<00:02:05.369> mermail

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
