there<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.600> was<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.920> three<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.009> four

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there was there was a three or four

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.090 
there was there was a three or four
different<00:01:50.720> times<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
different times that that I think the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
different times that that I think the
studio<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:56.610> looking<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.240> putting<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.659> movie

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
studio was looking at putting this movie

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.740 
studio was looking at putting this movie
out<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.159> turned<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.000> same<00:02:00.360> week<00:02:00.540> as

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
out as it turned out the same week as

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.649 
out as it turned out the same week as
second<00:02:01.680> half<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.329> second<00:02:03.329> half<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> my

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
second half of my second half of my

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.680 
second half of my second half of my
album<00:02:04.049> so

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
album so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.870 
album so
as<00:02:06.680> well<00:02:06.950> those<00:02:07.040> things<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.310> can't<00:02:07.490> plan<00:02:07.730> out

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
as well those things you can't plan out

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.859 
as well those things you can't plan out
you<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.090> kind<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.510> roll<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
you just kind of have to roll with the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.050 
you just kind of have to roll with the
punches<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:09.380> think<00:02:09.740> no<00:02:10.070> sleep<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.850> job

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
punches I think no sleep that's the job

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.060 
punches I think no sleep that's the job
that's<00:02:11.870> tough<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.260> far<00:02:12.440> as<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.620> don't<00:02:12.770> sleep

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
that's tough as far as you don't sleep

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.500 
that's tough as far as you don't sleep
and<00:02:13.700> what<00:02:13.940> would<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.120> say<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.390> biggest

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
and what would you say is the biggest

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.460 
and what would you say is the biggest
challenge<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:15.140> making<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.440> movie<00:02:17.470> working

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
challenge of making this movie working

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.170 
challenge of making this movie working
in<00:02:18.560> Puerto<00:02:18.860> Rico<00:02:19.160> was<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.340> lot<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.580> fun<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
in Puerto Rico was a lot of fun and the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.910 
in Puerto Rico was a lot of fun and the
people<00:02:20.630> were<00:02:20.720> great<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.140> we<00:02:21.290> worked<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.740> there

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
people were great but we worked on there

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.650 
people were great but we worked on there
during<00:02:22.160> hurricane<00:02:22.790> season<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> weather

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
during hurricane season so the weather

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
during hurricane season so the weather
was<00:02:23.960> probably<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.620> most<00:02:26.410> disagreeing<00:02:27.410> factor

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
was probably the most disagreeing factor

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.010 
was probably the most disagreeing factor
of<00:02:28.700> making<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.210> movie<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.450> mean<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:29.750> would<00:02:29.900> be

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
of making the movie I mean we would be

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.620 
of making the movie I mean we would be
shooting<00:02:31.210> exteriors<00:02:32.210> we'd<00:02:32.390> be<00:02:32.480> shooting

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
shooting exteriors we'd be shooting

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.330 
shooting exteriors we'd be shooting
outside<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.440> impede<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> Sun<00:02:34.070> will<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.310> out

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
outside and impede the Sun will be out

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.590 
outside and impede the Sun will be out
it<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.670> look<00:02:34.730> like<00:02:34.790> clear<00:02:35.120> skies<00:02:35.360> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
it would look like clear skies and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.850 
it would look like clear skies and
literally<00:02:35.960> all<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.380> sudden<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.650> would<00:02:36.740> be<00:02:36.830> a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
literally all of a sudden it would be a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.280 
literally all of a sudden it would be a
torrential<00:02:37.250> downpour<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.630> we'd<00:02:39.110> have<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
torrential downpour and we'd have to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.550 
torrential downpour and we'd have to
stop<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.950> scene<00:02:40.220> for<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.270> half<00:02:41.540> hour<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.110> just

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
stop the scene for a half hour and just

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.900 
stop the scene for a half hour and just
sit<00:02:42.800> there<00:02:42.950> under<00:02:43.250> these<00:02:43.930> huge<00:02:44.930> tents<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
sit there under these huge tents and and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.460 
sit there under these huge tents and and
wait<00:02:47.180> for<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.420> rain<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.600> pass<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.110> then<00:02:48.200> jump

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
wait for the rain to pass and then jump

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.190 
wait for the rain to pass and then jump
back<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.100> try<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:50.000> know<00:02:50.150> capture<00:02:51.020> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
back in and try to you know capture a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.140 
back in and try to you know capture a
moment<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:51.830> had<00:02:52.010> 30<00:02:52.340> minutes<00:02:52.700> prior

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
moment that you had 30 minutes prior

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390 
moment that you had 30 minutes prior
okay<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.050> wasn't<00:02:54.290> quite<00:02:54.380> as<00:02:54.650> idyllic<00:02:54.860> as<00:02:55.190> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
okay so it wasn't quite as idyllic as it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.180 
okay so it wasn't quite as idyllic as it
looked<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.790> screen<00:02:56.290> yeah<00:02:57.320> obviously

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
looked on the screen yeah obviously

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.160 
looked on the screen yeah obviously
there's<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.330> think<00:02:59.360> there's<00:02:59.600> only<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.840> one

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
there's I think there's only like one

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.320 
there's I think there's only like one
scene<00:03:00.620> where<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.280> we<00:03:01.370> shot<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:02.150> we

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
scene where that we shot that we

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.640 
scene where that we shot that we
actually<00:03:02.510> would<00:03:02.990> just<00:03:03.230> wouldn't<00:03:03.500> stop

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
actually would just wouldn't stop

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.500 
actually would just wouldn't stop
