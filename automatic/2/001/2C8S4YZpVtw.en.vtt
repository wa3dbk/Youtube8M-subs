 Finally, I have long been planning to do 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.610
 this category reviews mods 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.229
 but even it does not get me okay 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.510
 okay, hello to all my albert 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.049
 today there will be a review of mods for that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 There is a review of the fashion for a flashlight This is the same 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.509
 cool 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.840
 Only here a problem such 2 problem I 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 sick and a little difficult to write well 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 and the flashlight also offers but in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 cave so everything is so that's all that honest 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.530
 see this it will be the following reviews 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 mods but not now let 's talk 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.369
 just about the flashlight that's how it shines 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.829
 and you don't need any extras there just 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:55.290
 you throw the archive folder with the mod on the folder 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.829
 mods are such things 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 torch 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.530
 he shines very cool but 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.230
 not us then he and you can only but he 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.810
 only for mines as if because 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.950
 the street he is not very right now and I tell you this 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.840
 I'll show you how you should see from here now. 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.170
 I'll show you why it's not on the street 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.030
 worth using so lags something 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.520
 a little bit that's why but he sort of 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.360
 shines very much though he shines like this 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.900
 but how can one also be illuminated 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.100
 look it's so cool like that 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.200
 now 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.770
 but he shines like this 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.380
 go you put on the ground well how would 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:48.740
 here is a link to the mod I will give in the description and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.740
 craft you now see on the screen somewhere 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:58.910
 quality, he also did not bestow there like 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.740
 lamp lever and to me and she iron yes 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.550
 Here is such a little modic but very 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.850
 useful as you can shine something 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:16.500
 who did not have to find beavers 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:20.790
 here beavers I adore beavers but it will be in 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.739
 of the following review mods I somehow speak 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.780
 strange but what about all of you? 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.970
 knocked down a molecule that's such a little mod 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:32.940
 and by the way, see how he keeps it in 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.400
 hand too cool so you can 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.739
