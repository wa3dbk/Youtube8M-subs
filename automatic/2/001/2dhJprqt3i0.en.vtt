00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello to all i present myself cleland 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.660
 today we will see a little 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.809
 pretty nice trap 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 it allows to block players in one 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 place without killing them we go in there we are 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:25.109
 disappointed men around us hop on is 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.830
 blocked in front and behind that young 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 placed to be able to leave so that's 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.500
 quite useful it's a market after good 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 I did a little trick that makes the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.040
 unnecessary noise we end up again 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 blocked here now how do we do 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.870
 that's the whole point of this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.870
 video 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.969
 punctuating while we pass by 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.420
 and I confess makes a sort of hallway 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 authors' rights 3 wide and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 length you do as much as you want 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 me in this case I'm doing 1 2 3 4 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.420
 5 6 7 2 lengths very well ok so there 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.850
 we end up there for example if you 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.060
 put the prod the pressure plate here 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:20.040
 yeah it's ok here it's a hole 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 here here the voice of the other side we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.350
 landmark where again put a trick you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 put some restonica here and you 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.409
 put up here less disguised on a 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.259
 pressure plate we see ok that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.260
 lights up nook is so you do from 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.530
 hole here hole here that's it 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.750
 and you put 4 pistons in all we 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 need four tracks have an account here here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.290
 here here 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.190
 here are two there now we have to connect 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.840
 its pistons naturally and you m 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.580
 a block by block there of a block a block there 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.930
 two repeaters you absolutely must 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.810
 put it here and there and now we 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:19.570
 re-read with stone up 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.870
 when we see the room we see the two 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.010
 react ok so we're almost done 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.570
 nature energy up filled the lake holes 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.700
 slap there we pay too and it's over 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.040
 you have your system 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.390
 soon after you can hide I do not know 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.670
 where in all the up 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.560
 everything here think naturally enough of your 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.830
 survival there I do it in creative mode 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.480
 cold it's faster 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.890
 the goal is to see the system that 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.260
 it's not to do it in survival by myself 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.360
 which 7 errors yes so here it is seen 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.190
 the more you can do on our side 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 to see even if it's like nothing 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.680
 was 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.700
 when you go there whatever 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.430
 be calculated it can be me or 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.380
 critters matter they are roque metella 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.560
 and we do not know you but what is the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.190
 pop 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.680
 it is blocked we can observe it window 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.650
 and there I pronounce you see he is 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.380
 blocked here he can do nothing anymore 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.130
 until you arrive it's nice enough 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.450
 quite useful from time to time I'll you 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.730
 advise to do it with blocks 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.709
 strong enough to prevent it from being 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.590
 finally broken in this case a mode 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.290
 so pretty absolutely nothing but good one 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.260
 other player could this is this tutorial is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.570
 finished it's clear he's the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.790
 show and I hope you will follow the 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.790
 others and future video thank you
