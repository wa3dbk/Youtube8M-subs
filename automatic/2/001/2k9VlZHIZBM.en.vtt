00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.850 

so<00:00:00.329> getting<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.570> little<00:00:00.750> closer<00:00:00.960> here<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.709> terms

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so getting a little closer here in terms

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.930 
so getting a little closer here in terms
of<00:00:02.010> what<00:00:02.100> we've<00:00:02.280> got<00:00:02.460> again<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.710> top<00:00:04.710> plate<00:00:05.009> is

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
of what we've got again the top plate is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.419 
of what we've got again the top plate is
now<00:00:06.240> an<00:00:06.450> integrated<00:00:07.020> piece<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.890> goes<00:00:08.130> all<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
now an integrated piece so goes all the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.730 
now an integrated piece so goes all the
way<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.809> back<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.349> where<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.650> would

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
way from the the back and where it would

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.230 
way from the the back and where it would
normally<00:00:10.860> stop<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.519> around<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
normally stop right around here it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
normally stop right around here it
continues<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.259> way<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.710> rest<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
continues on all the way to the rest of

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.689 
continues on all the way to the rest of
the<00:00:14.219> car<00:00:14.690> we've<00:00:15.690> got<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:17.210> wiring<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.699> trying

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the car we've got the wiring so trying

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:42.440 
the car we've got the wiring so trying
to<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:24.330> focus<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:41.450> but

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to see in here and focus or not but

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.430 
to see in here and focus or not but
otherwise<00:00:43.850> three<00:00:44.850> wires<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.510> are<00:00:45.690> common<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
otherwise three wires that are common to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
otherwise three wires that are common to
the<00:00:46.469> brushless<00:00:46.739> systems<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.550> there<00:01:01.039> we're

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the brushless systems out there we're

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.300 
the brushless systems out there we're
still<00:01:02.280> using<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:06.020> standard<00:01:07.130> spacers<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
still using the standard spacers that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
still using the standard spacers that
you<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> motor-pod<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.810> as

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you would see in the motor-pod so as

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
you would see in the motor-pod so as
many<00:01:10.830> people<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.280> pointed<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.030> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
many people have pointed out this is not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690 
many people have pointed out this is not
a<00:01:12.390> threaded<00:01:13.049> motor<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.220> you're<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
a threaded motor so you're gonna have to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
a threaded motor so you're gonna have to
use<00:01:14.850> something<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.479> hold<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> motor<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
use something that can hold the motor in

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.710 
use something that can hold the motor in
by<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.310> neck<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> output<00:01:18.210> shaft<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
by the the neck of the output shaft like

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.940 
by the the neck of the output shaft like
we<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.320> side<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.979> course<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.860> key

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.260 

clearly<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.070> ball<00:01:29.490> bearing<00:01:29.850> motor<00:01:32.060> close<00:01:33.060> up

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
clearly a ball bearing motor close up

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.069 
clearly a ball bearing motor close up
here<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> board<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:35.220> does<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.820> much

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
here now on the board it does very much

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.530 
here now on the board it does very much
look<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.880> not<00:01:38.880> something<00:01:39.360> that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
look like this is not something that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.069 
look like this is not something that's
meant<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.020> user<00:01:40.409> serviceable<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
meant to be user serviceable so one of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.440 
meant to be user serviceable so one of
the<00:01:43.259> things<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:43.619> heard<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.670> know

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the things I've heard is that you know

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
the things I've heard is that you know
Kyosho<00:01:45.990> potential<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.189> recommend

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Kyosho potential is going to recommend

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.530 
Kyosho potential is going to recommend
that<00:01:47.759> folks<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.390> ahead<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:50.360> swap<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> motor

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that folks go ahead and swap the motor

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.990 
that folks go ahead and swap the motor
with<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.740> tabs<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.579> maybe<00:01:53.759> we'll

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
with a can that has tabs so maybe we'll

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.350 
with a can that has tabs so maybe we'll
CPN<00:01:54.479> release<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> motor<00:01:55.140> with<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.649> tap<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.610> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
CPN release a motor with a tap can so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.670 
CPN release a motor with a tap can so
we're<00:01:57.479> not<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.110> replacing<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we're not going to be replacing the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
we're not going to be replacing the
wires<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.219> come<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> board<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.030> easily

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
wires that come on the board not easily

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
wires that come on the board not easily
at<00:02:00.659> least<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.020> mean<00:02:01.140> obviously<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.619> solder

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
at least I mean obviously you can solder

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.020 
at least I mean obviously you can solder
those<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.490> he's<00:02:03.329> pretty<00:02:03.479> safety

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
those but he's pretty safety

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.730 
those but he's pretty safety
it's<00:02:04.270> gonna<00:02:04.390> what<00:02:04.870> your<00:02:05.020> warranty<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.560> you're

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
it's gonna what your warranty if you're

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's gonna what your warranty if you're
caught<00:02:05.920> doing<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:07.270> otherwise<00:02:07.510> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
caught doing that but otherwise you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.630 
caught doing that but otherwise you
should<00:02:07.960> be<00:02:08.050> able<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.289> tap<00:02:08.500> right<00:02:09.009> into<00:02:09.460> the

should be able to tap right into the

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.160 
should be able to tap right into the
standard<00:02:10.179> bullet<00:02:10.390> connectors<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.929> are

standard bullet connectors that are
coming<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.770> ah<00:02:11.980> but<00:02:12.790> otherwise<00:02:12.970> at<00:02:13.660> our

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
coming with this ah but otherwise at our

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.490 
coming with this ah but otherwise at our
ICS<00:02:14.440> connector<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.700> our<00:02:16.660> gyro<00:02:17.050> connector

ICS connector and our gyro connector

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.340 
ICS connector and our gyro connector
we'll<00:02:18.160> use<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:18.460> access<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.360> gyro<00:02:19.960> itself

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
we'll use your access to the gyro itself

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.530 
we'll use your access to the gyro itself
you<00:02:21.070> plan<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.520> testing<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.270> gyro

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you plan on testing this with the gyro

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.360 
you plan on testing this with the gyro
because<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.959> car<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.230> gonna<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> lot<00:02:23.770> faster

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
because the car is gonna be a lot faster

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.400 
because the car is gonna be a lot faster
than<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:25.240> standard<00:02:25.630> brushed<00:02:25.930> car<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.350> I'm

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
than a standard brushed car so I'm

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.480 
than a standard brushed car so I'm
thinking<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.770> might<00:02:26.800> need<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.160> little<00:02:27.370> help

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
thinking it might need a little help

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.910 
thinking it might need a little help
with<00:02:27.640> stability<00:02:27.940> at<00:02:28.870> least<00:02:29.020> if<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.500> get<00:02:29.770> on

with stability at least if I can get on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.080 
with stability at least if I can get on
this<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.520> away

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
this right away

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
this right away

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
otherwise the battery mounts I've heard

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.520 
otherwise the battery mounts I've heard
this<00:02:33.790> question<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.660> lot<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.110> know<00:02:35.230> what<00:02:35.320> kind

this question a lot you know what kind
of<00:02:35.560> batteries<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.400> use

of batteries is this going to use
remember<00:02:38.350> Brussel<00:02:38.709> systems<00:02:39.130> don't<00:02:39.280> require

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
remember Brussel systems don't require

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.570 
remember Brussel systems don't require
light<00:02:39.970> bulb<00:02:40.180> power<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.980> didn't<00:02:41.980> use<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.310> nickel

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
light bulb power I didn't use the nickel

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.770 
light bulb power I didn't use the nickel
metal<00:02:42.670> batteries<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:43.420> here<00:02:43.540> right<00:02:43.690> here

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
metal batteries in here right here

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.090 
metal batteries in here right here
that's<00:02:43.989> gonna<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.440> thing<00:02:44.500> plenty<00:02:44.860> fast

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
that's gonna make this thing plenty fast

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.070 
that's gonna make this thing plenty fast
as<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.730> we're<00:02:46.420> lucky<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.720> might<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:47.020> able

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
as it is we're lucky you might be able

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.020 
as it is we're lucky you might be able
to<00:02:47.290> throw<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.160> life<00:02:48.340> pack<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.880> does

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
to throw on the the life pack it does

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.979 
to throw on the the life pack it does
seem<00:02:49.270> like<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:50.220> captions<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> chassis

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
seem like the captions to the chassis

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.630 
seem like the captions to the chassis
itself<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.980> still<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.610> same<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.140> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
itself are still the same we have the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
itself are still the same we have the
screw<00:02:57.640> hole<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.810> back<00:02:59.020> with<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.560> standard

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
screw hole in the back with the standard

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.199 
screw hole in the back with the standard
mount<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.610> just<00:03:00.820> looks<00:03:01.030> like<00:03:01.530> back<00:03:02.530> those

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
