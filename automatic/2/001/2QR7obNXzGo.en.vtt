out<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.229> globe<00:00:07.830> gemenon<00:00:08.820> we've<00:00:09.269> got<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.390> 38<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
out the globe gemenon we've got a 38 and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.450 
out the globe gemenon we've got a 38 and
a<00:00:10.080> half<00:00:10.230> inch<00:00:10.440> board<00:00:10.710> that's<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.130> green<00:00:11.310> one

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
a half inch board that's the green one

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.270 
a half inch board that's the green one
we've<00:00:11.790> also<00:00:12.060> got<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.480> 35<00:00:13.050> inch<00:00:13.350> board<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.220> is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we've also got a 35 inch board this is

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.250 
we've also got a 35 inch board this is
the<00:00:14.430> orange<00:00:14.760> one<00:00:14.850> they're<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.660> similar<00:00:15.930> got

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the orange one they're very similar got

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.359 
the orange one they're very similar got
all<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> same<00:00:16.650> parts<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.250> different

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
all the same parts but just different

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
all the same parts but just different
dimensions<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.539> they're<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.169> great<00:00:19.380> downhill

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
dimensions so they're a great downhill

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
dimensions so they're a great downhill
kind<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:20.970> bombing<00:00:21.509> maybe<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.900> bit

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
kind of like bombing maybe a little bit

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
kind of like bombing maybe a little bit
of<00:00:22.109> commuting<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.800> sideways<00:00:23.249> you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.490> slide

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
of commuting get sideways you can slide

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
of commuting get sideways you can slide
on<00:00:23.849> them<00:00:23.970> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.179> want<00:00:24.679> the<00:00:25.679> bigger<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.070> is

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
on them if you want the bigger one is

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.319 
on them if you want the bigger one is
gonna<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.429> little<00:00:26.519> more<00:00:26.669> stable<00:00:26.909> because

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
gonna be a little more stable because

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:28.729 
gonna be a little more stable because
you<00:00:27.390> got<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.539> little<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.839> foot<00:00:28.050> space<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
you got a little more foot space the

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:29.540 
you got a little more foot space the
smaller<00:00:28.980> ones<00:00:29.159> can<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.339> little<00:00:29.489> more

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
smaller ones can be little more

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.460 
smaller ones can be little more
versatile<00:00:30.089> it'd<00:00:30.509> be<00:00:30.630> quicker<00:00:30.839> turn<00:00:31.140> so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
versatile it'd be quicker turn so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
versatile it'd be quicker turn so
depending<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.160> kind<00:00:32.220> of<00:00:32.369> writing<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.640> want

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
depending what kind of writing you want

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.130 
depending what kind of writing you want
to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.630> which<00:00:33.810> board

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to do that's going to be which board

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.870 
to do that's going to be which board
you're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> pick<00:00:34.950> they're<00:00:35.490> exactly<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you're going to pick they're exactly the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
you're going to pick they're exactly the
same<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> parts<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.990> we're<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.290> gonna

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
same at the parts so we're just gonna

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.140 
same at the parts so we're just gonna
look<00:00:37.560> at<00:00:37.650> one<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> let's<00:00:38.880> just<00:00:38.970> jump

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
look at one of them and let's just jump

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.750 
look at one of them and let's just jump
right<00:00:39.240> into<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> we're<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> look

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
right into that so we're going to look

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
right into that so we're going to look
at<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> bigger<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.360> again<00:00:42.660> 38<00:00:43.380> and<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> half

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
at the bigger one again 38 and a half

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
at the bigger one again 38 and a half
inches<00:00:44.700> long<00:00:44.880> it<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.810> 9<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.830> 3/4<00:00:47.340> inches<00:00:47.640> wide

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
inches long it is 9 and 3/4 inches wide

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.090 
inches long it is 9 and 3/4 inches wide
the<00:00:48.420> smaller<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:48.960> only<00:00:49.170> 9<00:00:49.380> inches<00:00:49.620> wide<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the smaller one is only 9 inches wide so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.070 
the smaller one is only 9 inches wide so
again<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.970> get<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> sense<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
again get it get a sense for the

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.260 
again get it get a sense for the
different<00:00:52.650> sizes<00:00:52.920> looking<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.880> trucks

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
different sizes looking at the trucks

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.780 
different sizes looking at the trucks
you've<00:00:54.630> got<00:00:54.810> your<00:00:55.020> drop<00:00:55.350> through<00:00:55.380> mount<00:00:56.190> slant

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
you've got your drop through mount slant

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.030 
you've got your drop through mount slant
reverse<00:00:57.270> kingpin<00:00:57.840> trucks<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.830> are<00:00:58.950> going

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
reverse kingpin trucks which are going

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740 
reverse kingpin trucks which are going
to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.310> you<00:00:59.820> know<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.180> stable<00:01:00.540> at<00:01:00.630> high

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
to be you know really stable at high

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
to be you know really stable at high
speeds<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.290> can<00:01:01.410> carve<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:02.040> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
speeds you can carve really well because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.980 
speeds you can carve really well because
the<00:01:02.610> drop<00:01:02.850> through<00:01:03.150> lowers<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> center<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
the drop through lowers the center of

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.870 
the drop through lowers the center of
gravity<00:01:04.079> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> board<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:05.400> makes<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.759> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gravity of the board also makes it a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
gravity of the board also makes it a
little<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.299> stable<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> wanted<00:01:07.440> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
little more stable one thing I wanted to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
little more stable one thing I wanted to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
do have the clear grip tape on the top

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
do have the clear grip tape on the top
which<00:01:14.040> allows<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.120> cool
