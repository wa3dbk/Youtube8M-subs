00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
ease of use again it has a little bit of

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.310 
ease of use again it has a little bit of
slip<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.239> would<00:04:21.419> like<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.870> have

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
slip I would like it to have

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.280

or<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.680> will<00:04:23.280> say<00:04:23.490> if<00:04:23.640> my<00:04:23.760> hair<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.030> thinner<00:04:24.630> it
