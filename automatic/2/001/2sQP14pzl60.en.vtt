00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
best graphics of any game mainly due to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.700 
best graphics of any game mainly due to
the<00:00:32.070> fact<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.399> mod<00:00:32.969> support<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.050> pc<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the fact that mod support on the pc is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
the fact that mod support on the pc is
so<00:00:35.340> excellent<00:00:35.699> that<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.179> really<00:00:36.359> is<00:00:36.899> something

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so excellent that it really is something

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860 
so excellent that it really is something
to<00:00:37.409> behold<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.460> i<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.609> crisis<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.359> let<00:00:39.690> down

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to behold but i know crisis to let down

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.809 
to behold but i know crisis to let down
a<00:00:39.899> lot<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.199> people<00:00:40.559> well<00:00:40.949> fans<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.609> series

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:41.819 
a lot of people well fans of the series

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:44.779 
a lot of people well fans of the series
mainly<00:00:42.659> due<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.839> its<00:00:43.199> change<00:00:43.679> of<00:00:43.889> location<00:00:44.339> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
mainly due to its change of location and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
mainly due to its change of location and
certain<00:00:45.420> other<00:00:45.659> factors<00:00:46.109> but<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
certain other factors but this is what I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.399 
certain other factors but this is what I
like<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.219> Crysis<00:00:47.609> 3<00:00:47.639> and<00:00:48.089> i'll<00:00:48.719> start<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.260> my

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
like in Crysis 3 and i'll start with my

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.039 
like in Crysis 3 and i'll start with my
main<00:00:49.620> factor<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:51.179> linearity<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
main factor which is the linearity in

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.009 
main factor which is the linearity in
Crysis<00:00:52.530> 2<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:53.069> far<00:00:53.639> too<00:00:53.670> prevalent<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.510> did

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
Crysis 2 was far too prevalent I did

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.479 
Crysis 2 was far too prevalent I did
appreciate<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.649> fact<00:00:55.799> that<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.249> a<00:00:56.309> lot

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
appreciate the fact that there was a lot

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
appreciate the fact that there was a lot
of<00:00:56.519> verticality<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.989> gameplay<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of verticality in the gameplay so you

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.669 
of verticality in the gameplay so you
could<00:00:59.519> obviously<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.479> rooftops<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
could obviously go on rooftops and on

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.410 
could obviously go on rooftops and on
the<00:01:02.069> ground<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.579> stuff<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.119> was

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the ground and stuff like that that was

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
the ground and stuff like that that was
really<00:01:03.749> a<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.229> element<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
really a good element to it but the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.150 
really a good element to it but the
jungle<00:01:05.940> location<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> original<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.650> much

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
jungle location of the original was much

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.910 
jungle location of the original was much
better<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> opinion<00:01:08.820> New<00:01:09.750> York<00:01:10.050> just<00:01:10.680> as

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
better in my opinion New York just as

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520 
better in my opinion New York just as
good<00:01:11.160> as<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> location<00:01:12.120> is<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.630> certain<00:01:13.440> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
good as the location is in certain of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.400 
good as the location is in certain of
the<00:01:13.590> games<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.130> does<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.060> suit<00:01:15.390> crisis<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
the games it does not suit crisis so

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.650 
the games it does not suit crisis so
with<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.100> mind<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.730> would<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
with that in mind I would say the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.930 
with that in mind I would say the
location<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> third<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.280> include

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
location for the third has to include

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.420 
location for the third has to include
some<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> jungle<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.650> least<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.310> be

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
some kind of jungle at least to be

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.430 
some kind of jungle at least to be
honest<00:01:23.730> I'd<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.210> happy<00:01:24.510> if<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:24.720> combine<00:01:25.080> both

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
honest I'd be happy if they combine both

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.890 
honest I'd be happy if they combine both
of<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.490> jungle<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.240> urban<00:01:27.570> area

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of them so a jungle and an urban area

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.720 
of them so a jungle and an urban area
because<00:01:28.410> both<00:01:28.620> bring<00:01:28.860> their<00:01:28.980> own<00:01:29.010> elements<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
because both bring their own elements of

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.270 
because both bring their own elements of
gameplay<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.630> unique<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
gameplay that are unique but as I say I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
gameplay that are unique but as I say I
think<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> urban<00:01:32.970> focus<00:01:33.480> was<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> detraction

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
think the urban focus was a detraction

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.280 
think the urban focus was a detraction
from<00:01:34.980> the<00:01:35.280> original<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.080> originally<00:01:37.080> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
from the original and originally the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.890 
from the original and originally the
jungle<00:01:37.740> set<00:01:38.190> crisis<00:01:38.640> apart<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
jungle set crisis apart from a lot of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
jungle set crisis apart from a lot of
the<00:01:39.990> pack<00:01:40.290> I'd<00:01:40.800> also<00:01:40.980> say<00:01:41.220> make<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> campaign

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the pack I'd also say make the campaign

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
the pack I'd also say make the campaign
longer<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.720> size<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.230> levels<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.890> crisis

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
longer the size of the levels in crisis

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
longer the size of the levels in crisis
to<00:01:44.520> work<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.480> good<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.350> actual

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to work pretty good but the actual

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.890 
to work pretty good but the actual
amount<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.730> not<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.810> say

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
amount of them was not so I just say

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.200 
amount of them was not so I just say
make<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.230> campaign<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.860> couple<00:01:50.370> on<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.120> were

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
make the campaign a couple on there were

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120 
make the campaign a couple on there were
a<00:01:51.240> few<00:01:51.420> hours<00:01:51.480> longer<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.440> because<00:01:52.830> for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
a few hours longer really because for

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
a few hours longer really because for
all<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> its<00:01:53.490> so-called<00:01:54.000> shortcomings<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
all of its so-called shortcomings the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
all of its so-called shortcomings the
campaign<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.890> still<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.340> good<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.790> much

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
campaign was still really good and much

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.490 
campaign was still really good and much
better<00:01:57.420> than<00:01:57.630> most<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.110> first-person

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
better than most of a first-person

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.980 
better than most of a first-person
shooters<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> my<00:01:59.280> opinion<00:01:59.550> one<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> quite

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
shooters in my opinion one of the quite

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.290 
shooters in my opinion one of the quite
pressing<00:02:01.500> issue<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.460> single<00:02:02.820> player<00:02:02.940> is

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
pressing issue in the single player is

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.710 
pressing issue in the single player is
the<00:02:03.960> artificial<00:02:04.620> intelligence<00:02:05.280> AI<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
the artificial intelligence AI if the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.469 
the artificial intelligence AI if the
enemies<00:02:07.440> was<00:02:07.680> pretty<00:02:07.979> atrocious<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.849> an

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
enemies was pretty atrocious and an

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.259 
enemies was pretty atrocious and an
example<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.170> say<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.280> under<00:02:11.819> heavy<00:02:11.969> fire

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
example is say you're under heavy fire

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.839 
example is say you're under heavy fire
from<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.989> bunch<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.319> enemies<00:02:13.439> you<00:02:14.189> just<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.609> into

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
from a bunch of enemies you just go into

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.970 
from a bunch of enemies you just go into
cloak<00:02:15.150> behind<00:02:15.629> some<00:02:15.870> cover<00:02:16.109> and<00:02:16.409> they<00:02:16.799> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
cloak behind some cover and they just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.570 
cloak behind some cover and they just
forget<00:02:17.249> your

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
forget your

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.340 
forget your
distance<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.240> can<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.570> stroll<00:02:19.170> away

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
distance and you can just stroll away

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.340 
distance and you can just stroll away
I'm<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.160> firm<00:02:20.520> belief<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.030> when<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.110> up

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
I'm of the firm belief that when you up

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.960 
I'm of the firm belief that when you up
the<00:02:22.530> difficulty<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.340> should<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
the difficulty it should make the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.180 
the difficulty it should make the
enemies<00:02:24.300> smarter<00:02:24.840> rather<00:02:25.110> than<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.620> making

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
enemies smarter rather than just making

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.520 
enemies smarter rather than just making
your<00:02:26.460> health<00:02:26.730> lower<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.510> their<00:02:28.260> health

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
your health lower and their health

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.890 
your health lower and their health
higher<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.160> should<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> lot<00:02:30.090> more<00:02:30.120> advanced

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
higher it should be a lot more advanced

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530 
higher it should be a lot more advanced
than<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.280> multiplayer<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.180> did

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
than that as for the multiplayer I did

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.900 
than that as for the multiplayer I did
like<00:02:33.750> Crysis<00:02:34.170> tues<00:02:34.350> multiplayer<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.730> all

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
like Crysis tues multiplayer but it all

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.440 
like Crysis tues multiplayer but it all
felt<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.810> call<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.230> duty<00:02:37.620> esque<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
felt a bit to call of duty esque and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.060 
felt a bit to call of duty esque and
crisis<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.660> enough<00:02:39.900> great<00:02:40.410> stuff<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.980> on

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
crisis has enough great stuff going on

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.710 
crisis has enough great stuff going on
without<00:02:41.280> having<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.790> emulate<00:02:42.180> others<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
without having to emulate others and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.660 
without having to emulate others and
with<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.200> mind<00:02:43.230> I'd<00:02:43.650> say<00:02:43.890> go<00:02:44.130> back<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
with that in mind I'd say go back to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.240 
with that in mind I'd say go back to
more<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.540> original<00:02:45.630> type<00:02:46.560> multiplayer

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
more of the original type multiplayer

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.340 
more of the original type multiplayer
that<00:02:47.490> made<00:02:47.640> crisis<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.270> great<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.140> means

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
that made crisis one great so that means

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.190 
that made crisis one great so that means
up<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.980> Play<00:02:50.190> account<00:02:50.450> preferably<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.660> 30<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
up the Play account preferably to 30 to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.500 
up the Play account preferably to 30 to
make<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.980> maps<00:02:53.190> big<00:02:53.430> again<00:02:53.790> keep<00:02:54.300> that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
make the maps big again keep that

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.300 
make the maps big again keep that
verticality<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> mentioned<00:02:55.830> about<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
verticality that I mentioned about the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.710 
verticality that I mentioned about the
single<00:02:56.670> player<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.270> was<00:02:57.390> also<00:02:57.540> in

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
single player because that was also in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.420 
single player because that was also in
the<00:02:57.810> multiplayer<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.680> gave<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the multiplayer and it really gave the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.670 
the multiplayer and it really gave the
whole<00:02:59.640> game<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.090> extra<00:03:00.390> dimension<00:03:01.050> bring

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
whole game that extra dimension bring

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.120 
whole game that extra dimension bring
back<00:03:01.860> vehicles<00:03:02.430> I'd<00:03:02.730> say<00:03:03.300> leveling<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.260> perks

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
back vehicles I'd say leveling and perks

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.940 
back vehicles I'd say leveling and perks
are<00:03:05.520> fine<00:03:06.120> really<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.900> long<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.350> they<00:03:07.770> don't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
are fine really as long as they don't

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.070 
are fine really as long as they don't
give<00:03:08.220> someone<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.820> massive<00:03:09.300> advantage<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
give someone a massive advantage and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.140 
give someone a massive advantage and
also<00:03:10.680> kill<00:03:10.920> streak<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.370> an<00:03:11.459> extent<00:03:11.820> I'd<00:03:11.970> say

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
also kill streak to an extent I'd say

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.570 
also kill streak to an extent I'd say
yet<00:03:12.420> stuff<00:03:12.720> like<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.350> radar<00:03:13.800> resistance<00:03:14.340> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
yet stuff like the radar resistance and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.030 
yet stuff like the radar resistance and
the<00:03:15.480> advanced<00:03:15.930> power<00:03:16.200> suit<00:03:16.500> stuff<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:16.980> that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the advanced power suit stuff like that

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.920 
the advanced power suit stuff like that
is<00:03:17.160> okay<00:03:17.550> as<00:03:17.820> long<00:03:17.970> as<00:03:18.150> you're<00:03:18.270> not<00:03:18.330> getting

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
is okay as long as you're not getting

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.320 
is okay as long as you're not getting
kills<00:03:19.230> from<00:03:19.440> killstreaks<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.430> stuff<00:03:20.970> like<00:03:21.060> ass

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
kills from killstreaks so stuff like ass

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.820 
kills from killstreaks so stuff like ass
right<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.630> think<00:03:22.019> shouldn't<00:03:22.410> be<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> game

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
right I think shouldn't be in the game

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.560 
right I think shouldn't be in the game
really<00:03:23.100> another<00:03:23.760> thing<00:03:23.970> i'd<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.420> see

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
make a return from the original is power

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.190 
make a return from the original is power
struggle<00:03:26.700> which<00:03:26.940> was<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.360> game<00:03:27.570> mode<00:03:27.810> where

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

to see is some kind of hard mode I feel
like<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.650> suggest<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.400> more<00:03:56.580> or<00:03:56.670> less

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
like I suggest this in more or less

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.850 
like I suggest this in more or less
every<00:03:57.030> game<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:57.750> crisis<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.560> particular

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
every game but in crisis in particular

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.979 
every game but in crisis in particular
it<00:03:59.280> would<00:03:59.430> be<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.790> very<00:03:59.850> good<00:04:00.239> addition<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
it would be a very good addition the

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.870 
it would be a very good addition the
whole<00:04:01.170> suit<00:04:01.500> abilities<00:04:02.010> give<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.760> extra

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
whole suit abilities give it that extra

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.810 
whole suit abilities give it that extra
dimension<00:04:03.720> with<00:04:04.050> several<00:04:04.890> players<00:04:05.130> there's<00:04:05.730> a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
dimension with several players there's a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.460 
dimension with several players there's a
good<00:04:06.000> variety<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.570> enemies<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.170> could<00:04:07.320> upgrade

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
good variety of enemies it could upgrade

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.130 
good variety of enemies it could upgrade
from<00:04:07.830> human<00:04:08.220> enemies<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.700> alien<00:04:09.060> enemies<00:04:09.390> to

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
from human enemies to alien enemies to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.080 
from human enemies to alien enemies to
advanced<00:04:10.620> alien<00:04:10.950> enemies<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.400> massive<00:04:11.790> alien

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
advanced alien enemies to massive alien

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.990 
advanced alien enemies to massive alien
enemies<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:13.620> if<00:04:13.799> Crytek<00:04:14.580> really

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
enemies and I think if Crytek really

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 
enemies and I think if Crytek really
took<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.630> idea<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.140> run<00:04:16.290> with<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.859> could

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
took the idea and run with it they could

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.979 
took the idea and run with it they could
make<00:04:17.160> something<00:04:17.430> quite<00:04:17.760> special<00:04:17.989> something

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
make something quite special something

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.020 
make something quite special something
else<00:04:19.169> are<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.650> much<00:04:19.830> like<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> happen<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.760> for

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
else are very much like to happen is for

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.070 
else are very much like to happen is for
Crytek<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.590> reestablish<00:04:23.490> crisis<00:04:24.360> as<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
Crytek to reestablish crisis as the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.350 
Crytek to reestablish crisis as the
absolute<00:04:25.229> pinnacle<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:26.360> graphical

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
absolute pinnacle of graphical

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.080 
absolute pinnacle of graphical
technology<00:04:28.020> crisis<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:28.890> made<00:04:29.310> its<00:04:29.520> name<00:04:29.700> from

technology crisis one made its name from

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.730 
having sweet ass graphics
me<00:04:31.980> as<00:04:32.250> primarily<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.240> console<00:04:33.690> gamer<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.350> was

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
me as primarily a console gamer I was

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.800 
me as primarily a console gamer I was
incredibly<00:04:35.280> interested<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:35.880> crisis<00:04:36.360> solely

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
incredibly interested in crisis solely

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.510 
incredibly interested in crisis solely
because<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.410> graphics<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.100> then<00:04:38.400> it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
because of the graphics and then it

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520 
because of the graphics and then it
turned<00:04:38.730> out<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.000> be<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> really<00:04:39.450> great<00:04:39.570> game<00:04:39.900> so

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
turned out to be a really great game so

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.160 
turned out to be a really great game so
prioritize<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.640> pc<00:04:41.970> development<00:04:42.510> if<00:04:42.660> that's

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
prioritize the pc development if that's

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.870 
prioritize the pc development if that's
the<00:04:43.440> way<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.890> has<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.040> be<00:04:44.340> which<00:04:44.670> obviously

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
the way it has to be which obviously

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.420 
the way it has to be which obviously
would<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.510> up<00:04:45.750> t<00:04:46.200> make<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.650> game<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:46.980> next-gen

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
would be up t make the game on next-gen

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.580 
would be up t make the game on next-gen
consoles<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.870> consoles<00:04:49.320> aren't

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
consoles so that the consoles aren't

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.190 
consoles so that the consoles aren't
left<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.040> dust<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.640> they<00:04:51.000> can<00:04:51.150> still<00:04:51.390> get

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
left in the dust but they can still get

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.110 
left in the dust but they can still get
a<00:04:52.230> comparable<00:04:52.980> version<00:04:53.550> although<00:04:53.790> we

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
a comparable version although we

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.340 
a comparable version although we
obviously<00:04:54.240> don't<00:04:54.540> know<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> power<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.110> these

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
obviously don't know the power of these

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.470 
obviously don't know the power of these
consoles<00:04:55.770> yet<00:04:56.100> we<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.610> assume<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:56.940> but

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
consoles yet we can assume that but

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.970 
consoles yet we can assume that but
their<00:04:57.660> launch<00:04:57.990> they<00:04:58.440> won't<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.740> too<00:04:58.950> far

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
their launch they won't be too far

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.030 
their launch they won't be too far
behind<00:04:59.250> PCs<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.180> just<00:05:00.690> really<00:05:00.900> let<00:05:01.200> crisis<00:05:01.860> be

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
behind PCs and just really let crisis be

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.010 
behind PCs and just really let crisis be
at<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.250> forefront<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.880> graphics<00:05:03.720> again

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
at the forefront of graphics again

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.170 
at the forefront of graphics again
because<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.830> mod<00:05:05.010> support<00:05:05.220> for<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.790> original

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
because the mod support for the original

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.020 
because the mod support for the original
crisis<00:05:06.660> showed<00:05:07.200> just<00:05:07.560> how<00:05:07.650> amazing<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.669> video

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
crisis showed just how amazing a video

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.270 
crisis showed just how amazing a video
game<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.540> look<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.020> finally<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:10.830> couple<00:05:11.220> of
