00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
of holes lean water too just for fresh

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
of holes lean water too just for fresh
air<00:01:01.649> depends<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.190> long<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> fosters<00:01:02.789> going

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

air depends how long the fosters going
to<00:01:03.000> last<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.799> poked<00:01:04.799> holes<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.309> lot<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> holes

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
to last I poked holes a lot of holes

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
to last I poked holes a lot of holes
because<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.720> no<00:01:06.810> frost<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> me

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
because there was no frost or just to me

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.830 
because there was no frost or just to me
when<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.369> don't<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
when I don't want this to be like a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
when I don't want this to be like a
parachute<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.799> holes<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
parachute I put some holes and so the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.870 
parachute I put some holes and so the
accident<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.360> blow<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> guess

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
accident going just blow it up I guess

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.219

now because I don't want these guys to

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.240 
now because I don't want these guys to
boil<00:04:04.050> up<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.410> those

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
