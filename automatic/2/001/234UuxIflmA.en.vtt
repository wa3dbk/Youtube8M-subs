00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
is going to be a piece of red and a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.930 
is going to be a piece of red and a
stick<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.530> piece<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:16.980> red<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.790> from

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
stick a piece of red is going to be from

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.390 
stick a piece of red is going to be from
the<00:02:18.060> redstone<00:02:18.390> war<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.050> actually

the redstone war and this actually

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
the redstone war and this actually
doubles<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.670> pretty<00:02:21.000> much<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.690> be

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
doubles so pretty much it's going to be

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650 
doubles so pretty much it's going to be
a<00:02:21.840> redstone<00:02:22.260> torch<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:23.010> well<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.910> normal

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
a redstone torch as well as a normal
torch<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.050> does<00:02:25.230> both<00:02:25.410> things<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.890> once<00:02:26.190> next

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
torch so does both things at once next

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.759 
torch so does both things at once next
thing<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.209> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.720> red<00:02:28.050> log<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.680> the

thing is going to be the red log so the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.650 
thing is going to be the red log so the
red<00:02:28.920> log<00:02:29.099> comes<00:02:29.400> from<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> red<00:02:30.000> tree<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.850 
red log comes from the red tree that you
can<00:02:30.780> break<00:02:30.930> down<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.260> more<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.530> decorative

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
bunch of pieces of bread so we're gonna

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.920 
bunch of pieces of bread so we're gonna
get<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.470> um<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.330> got<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> piece<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
get to that um so you got the piece of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.210 
get to that um so you got the piece of
Mach<00:03:07.140> 2<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.470> we're<00:03:07.560> gonna<00:03:07.680> go<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.890> Mach<00:03:08.040> 2

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220

be<00:04:29.750> three<00:04:30.020> pieces<00:04:30.260> of<00:04:30.590> red<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.340> then<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:32.150> read

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
be three pieces of red and then to read

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.300 
be three pieces of red and then to read
energy<00:04:32.780> blocks<00:04:33.200> which<00:04:33.500> is<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:33.890> of<00:04:33.950> boring<00:04:34.100> so

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
energy blocks which is kind of boring so

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.190 
energy blocks which is kind of boring so
I'm<00:04:34.370> not<00:04:34.460> going<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.640> show<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:34.820> guys<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.200> so

the pics at the the normal red pick the
red<00:04:50.930> kick<00:04:51.140> is<00:04:51.290> going<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.680> just<00:04:52.100> like<00:04:52.190> an

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
red kick is going to be just like an

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.460 
red kick is going to be just like an
iron<00:04:52.970> pic<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.360> if<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.510> actually<00:04:53.600> switch<00:04:54.020> out<00:04:54.290> of

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
iron pic so if I actually switch out of

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.040 
iron pic so if I actually switch out of
game<00:04:54.980> out<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.970> can<00:04:56.450> actually<00:04:56.600> go<00:04:56.840> today

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
game out here I can actually go today

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.880 
efficient but it's going to have eight
thou<00:05:19.220> or<00:05:19.580> over<00:05:20.000> eight<00:05:20.210> thousand<00:05:21.020> uses<00:05:21.380> guest

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
thou or over eight thousand uses guest

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.620 
thou or over eight thousand uses guest
but<00:05:22.160> that<00:05:22.280> in<00:05:22.340> perspective<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.970> diamond<00:05:23.480> pick

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
but that in perspective a diamond pick

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.960 
but that in perspective a diamond pick
is<00:05:23.750> something<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.140> 1400<00:05:24.950> uses<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:25.730> this<00:05:25.880> is

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
is something like 1400 uses so this is

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.780 
is something like 1400 uses so this is
gonna<00:05:26.150> have<00:05:26.330> you<00:05:26.510> know<00:05:26.630> eat<00:05:26.870> over<00:05:27.230> 8,000<00:05:28.070> uses

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
gonna have you know eat over 8,000 uses

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.360 
gonna have you know eat over 8,000 uses
almost<00:05:29.180> over<00:05:29.480> 9000<00:05:30.050> but<00:05:30.500> that's<00:05:30.950> pretty<00:05:31.160> good

almost over 9000 but that's pretty good
it's<00:05:31.640> definitely<00:05:32.030> something<00:05:32.570> that<00:05:32.920> might<00:05:33.920> be

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
it's definitely something that might be
