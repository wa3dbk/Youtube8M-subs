00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so if I take a simple song like mary had

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000 
so if I take a simple song like mary had
a<00:01:06.450> little<00:01:06.510> lamb<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.500> I've<00:01:07.650> done<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.950> before

a little lamb and I've done this before

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.480 
a little lamb and I've done this before
