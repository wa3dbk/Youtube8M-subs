00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.830 
fitness but it is fitness
I<00:02:10.240> was<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.540> one<00:02:10.840> week<00:02:11.170> that's<00:02:12.100> what<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.400> do

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I was just one week that's what I do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.350 
I was just one week that's what I do
every<00:02:13.840> week<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.710> that's<00:02:15.070> really<00:02:15.550> what<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
every week and that's really what is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080 
every week and that's really what is
necessary<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:17.320> lose<00:02:18.010> weight<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.790> reason

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
necessary to lose weight and the reason

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.940 
necessary to lose weight and the reason
why<00:02:19.210> I've<00:02:19.360> had<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.750> lose<00:02:20.140> all<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.530> weight<00:02:20.590> is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
why I've had to lose all this weight is

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.950 
why I've had to lose all this weight is
because<00:02:21.280> i<00:02:21.400> was<00:02:21.730> i<00:02:22.000> was<00:02:22.240> very<00:02:22.390> overweight<00:02:22.780> and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
because i was i was very overweight and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.810 
because i was i was very overweight and
i<00:02:23.320> was<00:02:23.470> very<00:02:23.590> overweight<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.220> majority<00:02:24.790> of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
i was very overweight for a majority of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.760 
i was very overweight for a majority of
my<00:02:25.390> life<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.200> think<00:02:26.820> my<00:02:27.820> depression<00:02:28.750> had<00:02:29.260> a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
my life and I think my depression had a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.470 
my life and I think my depression had a
lot<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.400> because<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.880> when<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.300> was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
lot to do with it because I when I was

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.360 
lot to do with it because I when I was
like<00:02:31.570> five<00:02:31.810> i<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:32.080> diagnosed<00:02:32.290> with<00:02:32.740> severe

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
like five i was diagnosed with severe

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.880 
like five i was diagnosed with severe
depression<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.090> severe<00:02:34.510> OCD<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.170> severe

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
depression and severe OCD and severe

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.890 
depression and severe OCD and severe
anxiety<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> when<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> was<00:02:37.060> five<00:02:37.540> for

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
anxiety like it when I was five for

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.870 
anxiety like it when I was five for
crying<00:02:38.140> out<00:02:38.230> loud<00:02:38.290> where's<00:02:38.860> eating<00:02:39.280> because

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
crying out loud where's eating because

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.360 
crying out loud where's eating because
of<00:02:40.090> feelings<00:02:40.510> there<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.950> now<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
of feelings there you go and now that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.970 
of feelings there you go and now that
I'm<00:02:42.550> more<00:02:42.850> fit<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.300> am<00:02:43.720> much<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.320> confident

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
I'm more fit I am much more confident

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.010 
I'm more fit I am much more confident
it's<00:02:45.250> funny<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:46.090> think<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.750> lot<00:02:46.810> of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
it's funny because I think a lot of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's funny because I think a lot of
trans<00:02:47.350> guys<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:48.010> overweight<00:02:48.430> because<00:02:48.640> it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
trans guys are overweight because it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.260 
trans guys are overweight because it
gives<00:02:49.120> them<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.450> more<00:02:49.600> ambiguous<00:02:49.930> look<00:02:50.500> and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
gives them a more ambiguous look and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.060 
gives them a more ambiguous look and
that's<00:02:52.270> definitely<00:02:52.450> kind<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.960> one<00:02:53.680> reason<00:02:53.980> why

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
that's definitely kind of one reason why

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.490 
that's definitely kind of one reason why
I<00:02:54.100> was<00:02:54.340> overweight<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:55.300> now<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.690> help<00:02:55.960> us<00:02:56.230> hell
