00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 the ships scales are a sample of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 perseverance that they will surely give to your 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.140
 home that touch of culture and elegance 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.640
 that you were looking for and Mr. Ulises offers you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 this alternative decoration 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.339
 Mr. ulises tell us what was 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.880
 first that armed and that did discover 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.460
 I had like this hobby 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.440
 good look is a story that dates from 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.900
 many years ago 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.240
 I remember the first thing I put together 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.070
 plastic small cart that sweep 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.260
 some days 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.260
 to her when I had that crap 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.480
 it was huge to that you have to open the box 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.390
 of the pieces and two joints 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.820
 sleep in 15 minutes like that with glue 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.660
 that my mom had out there in the in the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.730
 kitchen unskilled obviously without 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.520
 paint or decal or anything the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.600
 project was like who says my first 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.600
 my first little step 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 life 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.400
 and then as I hector fabio that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.659
 I had liked that it attracted attention 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.619
 that I really enjoyed being there 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.840
 so I bought another one of the others 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.340
 more difficult and one day he gave me a 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.769
 sailboat 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.390
 What would you be? She bought me pinturitas and 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.569
 the most success 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.330
 and eventually the thing to do 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.950
 things with your hands is always a thing 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.370
 that caught my attention not 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 forever 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.090
 the gun the guitarist 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.840
 for me hands do something with the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.470
 hands, he's always making a 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 very thing of mine 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030
 Y 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.050
 don ulises talk about the history of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.140
 this boat named san juan bautista 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.610
 this in particular was the first ship 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.520
 of wood that I finished 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.500
 this the particularity that it has is that 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.760
 he buys it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.129
 incredibly in a magazine rack 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.799
 is they started to take out an editorial 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.799
 Spanish began to take out articles 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.989
 weekly where a brochure came with 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.790
 instructions and he was elected with history 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.690
 since every time of this neighborhood that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.790
 they have a bunch of pieces then 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 as it was per week then I started them 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.510
 collecting were 100 while he ponders 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.810
 without telling 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.340
 and after more or less a 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.240
 I calculate between 900 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.740
 and what hours of work do 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.740
 I do not have and finish 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:54.260
 I can not say that I've taken a year 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.780
 and a half to three years in a position 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.629
 but I think that one more parameter 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.110
 target would be the hours that if you 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.069
 they spend very little time in that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.230
 popular 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.980
 We are talking about more or less you 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.930
 invest 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.930
 order 1000 1200 hours 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.720
 mister ulises in all the contests that 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.970
 you have entered now yes you have 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.590
 devastated with the four prizes and the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.150
 recognitions that become true what 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.820
 that was telling us that moment 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:36.169
 because if you said that while 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.759
 the judges have been poisons with me 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.639
 Well, when I brought my boats to 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.480
 bankrupt and have donated the 4 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.480
 prizes that can win 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:51.640
 and how is it the first boat place in 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.100
 then the best naval candle that's all 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.920
 that swims and floats 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.140
 and then a very important prize for me 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.860
 what is called the first model more 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.610
 popular that they give it to them with 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.270
 cancel before 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.270
 yes 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.550
 and it can work very well as 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.479
 very nice decorative vanished 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.600
 done I do not know if they have realized this 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.670
 for example 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.670
 in movies when he leaves the office 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.310
 the president of the us is very common 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.000
 the fund has a true pact 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.840
 they want to have a candle weapon 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.150
 clear celebrates mari standards 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.770
 This is a very decorative element 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.979
 elegant and does not give much much 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.729
 presence in the elegance that the 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.729
 boat itself 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.320
 many people when you see the boats you hear 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.960
 that patient patience does not really 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.960
 is the key word and perseverance
