and with the Pedro from Hollis Porter
that<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> company<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:08.030> is<00:00:09.030> based<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
that is a company that is based in the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
that is a company that is based in the
north<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.410> Portugal<00:00:10.680> and<00:00:11.309> they<00:00:11.760> had<00:00:11.940> prepare

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
north of Portugal and they had prepare

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.600 
north of Portugal and they had prepare
at<00:00:12.600> least<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> new<00:00:13.250> technology<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.400> gonna

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
at least the new technology is gonna

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.750 
at least the new technology is gonna
talk<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.719> yes<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.550> this

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
talk about this yes and so we have this

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.990 
talk about this yes and so we have this
technology<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.960> called<00:00:19.289> DIPG<00:00:19.919> it's<00:00:20.849> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
technology that it's called DIPG it's a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.519 
technology that it's called DIPG it's a
new<00:00:21.150> technology<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.320> been

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
new technology that you have been

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.310 
new technology that you have been
developing<00:00:23.310> since<00:00:24.320> more<00:00:25.320> than<00:00:26.160> two<00:00:26.400> years<00:00:26.429> and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
developing since more than two years and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.259 
developing since more than two years and
this<00:00:28.320> technology<00:00:28.800> gives<00:00:29.579> them<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
this technology gives them the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.140 
this technology gives them the
possibility<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.470> make<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> fusion<00:00:32.310> of<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
possibility to make the fusion of the

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.190 
possibility to make the fusion of the
the<00:00:34.079> graphics<00:00:34.560> into<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> plastic<00:00:36.000> parts<00:00:36.420> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the graphics into the plastic parts as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.450 
the graphics into the plastic parts as
you<00:00:37.410> probably<00:00:38.040> already<00:00:38.610> know<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.220> past

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you probably already know on the past

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.670 
you probably already know on the past
they<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.820> used<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.420> stickers<00:00:42.900> graphics

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
they have used these stickers graphics

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.610 
they have used these stickers graphics
they<00:00:44.340> glued<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.300> plastic<00:00:45.690> pads<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
they glued into the plastic pads now

police port using we have a new

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.480 
police port using we have a new
technology<00:00:50.490> that<00:00:50.670> allow<00:00:51.330> us<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.720> fix<00:00:52.680> directly

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
technology that allow us to fix directly

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.990 
technology that allow us to fix directly
the<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:55.140> stickers<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> graphics<00:00:56.220> during<00:00:56.820> the

the the stickers the graphics during the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.590 
the the stickers the graphics during the
injection<00:00:57.150> process<00:00:57.810> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.100> feel<00:00:59.370> as<00:01:00.360> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
injection process as you can feel as you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.830 
injection process as you can feel as you
can<00:01:00.780> feel<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.650> can't<00:01:02.010> feel<00:01:02.340> the

decorative graphics it's impossible to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.529 
decorative graphics it's impossible to
peel<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.560> completely<00:01:08.249> fusion<00:01:08.880> into

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
peel it off is a completely fusion into

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.880 
peel it off is a completely fusion into
the<00:01:09.659> plastics

the project leader or these IPD okay and
so<00:01:18.850> for<00:01:19.390> this<00:01:19.600> technology<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.890> main<00:01:21.070> benefits

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
so for this technology the main benefits

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.990 
so for this technology the main benefits
of<00:01:21.910> this<00:01:22.180> it's<00:01:22.800> anti<00:01:23.800> scratch<00:01:23.950> first<00:01:24.670> very

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
of this it's anti scratch first very

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540 
of this it's anti scratch first very
important<00:01:25.480> deal<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.530> other<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:27.160> very

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
important deal and the other is very

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.370 
important deal and the other is very
difficult<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.330> remove<00:01:28.630> not<00:01:28.900> possible<00:01:29.260> to

conventional sticker this is the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.300 
conventional sticker this is the
environment<00:01:40.300> friendly<00:01:40.720> this<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.830> important

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
environment friendly this is important

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.490 
environment friendly this is important
because<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.760> could<00:01:42.880> recycle<00:01:43.300> this<00:01:43.570> product<00:01:43.990> is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
because it could recycle this product is

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.350 
because it could recycle this product is
not<00:01:44.740> enough<00:01:45.100> cleaning<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.729> external<00:01:46.270> level

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
not enough cleaning the external level

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.140 
not enough cleaning the external level
ok<00:01:47.020> we<00:01:47.530> cool<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:47.770> really<00:01:48.250> sparked<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
ok we cool it really sparked to have the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150 
ok we cool it really sparked to have the
part<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.570> put<00:01:49.780> on<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.020> bike<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.410> ready<00:01:51.040> to

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
part and put on the bike and ready to

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.630 
part and put on the bike and ready to
drive<00:01:52.119> this<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:52.810> also<00:01:53.170> important<00:01:53.680> no<00:01:53.830> extra

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
drive this is also important no extra

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.390 
drive this is also important no extra
labor<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.450> really<00:01:58.990> revolutionary

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
labor this is a really revolutionary

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.240 
labor this is a really revolutionary
product<00:02:00.400> that<00:02:01.000> will<00:02:01.450> change<00:02:01.479> for<00:02:02.290> sure<00:02:02.320> the
