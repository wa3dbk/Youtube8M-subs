00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.450 

perhaps<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.349> key<00:00:21.470> thing<00:00:21.680> about<00:00:21.830> this<00:00:21.980> car<00:00:22.070> is

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
perhaps the key thing about this car is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.880 
perhaps the key thing about this car is
that<00:00:22.550> essentially<00:00:23.029> is<00:00:23.150> lighter<00:00:23.539> than<00:00:23.689> 5<00:00:24.050> 99<00:00:24.320> x

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
that essentially is lighter than 5 99 x

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.130 
that essentially is lighter than 5 99 x
70<00:00:25.460> kilos<00:00:25.789> it<00:00:26.329> also<00:00:26.480> when<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:26.779> look<00:00:26.930> at<00:00:27.050> it

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
70 kilos it also when you look at it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.740 
70 kilos it also when you look at it
it's<00:00:27.410> much<00:00:28.039> more<00:00:28.220> compact<00:00:28.550> than<00:00:28.699> the<00:00:28.849> 599<00:00:29.270> it's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's much more compact than the 599 it's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.240 
it's much more compact than the 599 it's
almost<00:00:29.869> like<00:00:30.020> styling<00:00:30.649> is<00:00:30.859> skipped<00:00:31.160> a

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
almost like styling is skipped a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.210 
almost like styling is skipped a
generation<00:00:31.279> from<00:00:32.000> sort<00:00:32.300> of<00:00:32.360> 575<00:00:32.899> on<00:00:33.680> to<00:00:33.920> sort

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
generation from sort of 575 on to sort

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.979 
generation from sort of 575 on to sort
of<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.640> like<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:34.820> modern<00:00:35.540> version<00:00:35.570> of

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
of this it's like a modern version of

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.009 
of this it's like a modern version of
that<00:00:36.019> rather<00:00:36.890> than<00:00:37.129> an<00:00:37.489> evolution<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.150> 599<00:00:38.750> I

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
that rather than an evolution the 599 I

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.439 
that rather than an evolution the 599 I
think<00:00:39.680> that's<00:00:39.829> brilliant<00:00:40.070> for<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.550> one<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.329> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
think that's brilliant for it one of the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.000 
think that's brilliant for it one of the
really<00:00:41.750> interesting<00:00:41.900> things<00:00:42.230> about<00:00:42.470> this<00:00:42.800> is

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
really interesting things about this is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.130 
really interesting things about this is
the<00:00:43.129> bonnet<00:00:43.519> as<00:00:43.699> a<00:00:43.730> car<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.540> now<00:00:44.659> acts<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:45.110> a

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
the bonnet as a car it now acts like a

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.619 
the bonnet as a car it now acts like a
front<00:00:45.470> wing<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.980> you<00:00:46.640> can<00:00:46.760> see<00:00:46.970> with<00:00:47.570> the

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
front wing and you can see with the

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.260 
front wing and you can see with the
bottoms<00:00:47.900> up<00:00:48.019> how<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:48.440> channel's<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:48.949> air

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
bottoms up how it channel's the air

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.000 
bottoms up how it channel's the air
through<00:00:50.270> here<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.199> then<00:00:51.289> it<00:00:51.379> goes<00:00:51.469> down<00:00:51.739> and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
through here and then it goes down and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.250 
through here and then it goes down and
we'll<00:00:52.100> come<00:00:52.219> out<00:00:52.510> past<00:00:53.510> year<00:00:53.780> down<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.109> side

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
we'll come out past year down the side

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.380 
we'll come out past year down the side
of<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:54.469> car<00:00:54.640> what<00:00:55.640> they're<00:00:55.789> claiming<00:00:55.879> is<00:00:56.329> that

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
of the car what they're claiming is that

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.349 
of the car what they're claiming is that
this<00:00:56.690> outline<00:00:57.050> she<00:00:57.230> creates<00:00:57.530> up<00:00:57.850> 223<00:00:58.850> kilos<00:00:59.329> of

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
this outline she creates up 223 kilos of

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.709 
this outline she creates up 223 kilos of
downforce<00:00:59.899> of<00:01:00.079> 200,000<00:01:00.859> hours<00:01:01.359> 124<00:01:02.359> miles<00:01:02.539> an

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
downforce of 200,000 hours 124 miles an

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.980 
downforce of 200,000 hours 124 miles an
hour<00:01:02.809> twice<00:01:03.679> as<00:01:03.859> much<00:01:04.009> than<00:01:04.070> 599<00:01:04.940> ran<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.840> back

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
hour twice as much than 599 ran the back

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.600 
hour twice as much than 599 ran the back
of<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.140> car<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.679> can<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:06.920> even<00:01:07.160> easier<00:01:07.220> to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
of the car is I can be even easier to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.389 
of the car is I can be even easier to
see<00:01:07.789> how<00:01:08.570> all<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.050> aerodynamics<00:01:09.860> are<00:01:10.039> coming

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
see how all the aerodynamics are coming

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.760 
see how all the aerodynamics are coming
into<00:01:10.520> play<00:01:10.700> one<00:01:11.539> thing<00:01:11.780> was<00:01:12.140> entirely<00:01:12.440> sure

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
into play one thing was entirely sure

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.730 
into play one thing was entirely sure
about<00:01:12.800> design<00:01:13.369> wise<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.789> this<00:01:14.479> it's<00:01:15.320> rear<00:01:15.530> fog

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
about design wise is this it's rear fog

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.800 
about design wise is this it's rear fog
light<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.580> obviously<00:01:16.820> inspired<00:01:17.060> by<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.450> f1

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
light it's obviously inspired by the f1

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.950 
light it's obviously inspired by the f1
cars<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:18.789> that's<00:01:19.789> very<00:01:19.970> good

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
cars but that's very good

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.680 
cars but that's very good
I've<00:01:21.680> literally<00:01:21.979> just<00:01:22.250> jumped<00:01:22.610> into<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.299> f12

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
I've literally just jumped into the f12

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.510 
I've literally just jumped into the f12
but<00:01:23.960> less<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.470> first<00:01:24.680> time<00:01:24.920> i<00:01:24.979> sat<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
but less is the first time i sat in the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.320 
but less is the first time i sat in the
car<00:01:26.619> well<00:01:27.619> it's<00:01:27.740> amazing<00:01:28.000> sort<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.060> beamed

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
car well it's amazing sort of beamed

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.850 
car well it's amazing sort of beamed
down<00:01:29.570> here<00:01:29.900> with<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.200> various<00:01:30.409> buttons<00:01:30.619> on

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
down here with the various buttons on

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.740 
down here with the various buttons on
the<00:01:31.100> nice<00:01:31.280> thing<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:32.390> actually<00:01:32.510> feels

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
the nice thing is that it actually feels

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.350 
the nice thing is that it actually feels
like<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> much<00:01:33.110> smaller<00:01:33.380> car<00:01:33.710> than<00:01:33.950> 599<00:01:34.520> felt

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
like a much smaller car than 599 felt

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.200 
like a much smaller car than 599 felt
enormous<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:36.530> feels<00:01:37.009> much<00:01:37.430> more<00:01:37.640> will<00:01:37.850> d<00:01:38.060> is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
enormous this feels much more will d is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.580 
enormous this feels much more will d is
you<00:01:38.420> still<00:01:38.570> got<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.690> very<00:01:38.960> big<00:01:39.110> wheel<00:01:39.259> here<00:01:39.470> and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
you still got a very big wheel here and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.460 
you still got a very big wheel here and
not<00:01:39.680> see<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.979> large<00:01:40.700> paddles<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:41.390> somehow<00:01:42.350> I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
not see the large paddles but somehow I

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.680 
not see the large paddles but somehow I
think<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.000> scuttle<00:01:44.000> here<00:01:44.210> feels<00:01:44.450> lower

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
think this scuttle here feels lower

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.620 
think this scuttle here feels lower
there's<00:01:45.530> much<00:01:45.680> more<00:01:45.860> compact<00:01:46.159> behind<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
there's much more compact behind and the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.480 
there's much more compact behind and the
door<00:01:47.810> phone<00:01:48.020> seems<00:01:48.259> much<00:01:48.470> closer<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.950> my

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
door phone seems much closer to my

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.760 
door phone seems much closer to my
shoulders<00:01:49.940> so<00:01:50.180> yeah<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.810> feels<00:01:51.050> really<00:01:51.500> will

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
shoulders so yeah it feels really will

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.810 
shoulders so yeah it feels really will
be<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.390> that's<00:01:53.390> going<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.660> be<00:01:53.720> good<00:01:53.750> thing<00:01:54.820> now

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
be and that's going to be good thing now
