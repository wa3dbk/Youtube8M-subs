00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.010
 greet all lemon liqueur and third 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.660
 part 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.540
 lemon liqueur and because not only 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.179
 or man body and so as a result of our 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.779
 all pretty junk operations with 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.160
 lemons that we had 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 lemon zest which is behind them in a jar 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 strong 50 degrees of moonshine and in this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 If I had five or any, will share 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.420
 could even sugar fruit well 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 cereal is not very because with fruit 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.640
 pulled somehow well does not fit though it happens 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 interesting combinations of him about it later 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.360
 we got pure lemon juice if there 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610
 there are some flakes through a colander 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 strain normally work lemon juice and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.680
 we got lemon liqueur at given 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 case you got lemon ginger 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.890
 liquor because they saw 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.799
 i have added ginger to lyism can be lemon 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.520
 nutty whatever you want what 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.510
 add component and ore 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 will be de sugar and all 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:20.070
 and if somewhere in the hands falls with the fight 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.590
 a lemon taken from your friend's wife 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.229
 you can always take a shave cut it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.229
 here it is from one lemon and zest 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.049
 put on the battery to dry you will 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.070
 stockpile in some way 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.450
 which him you can then use 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.540
 the fact is that if they want the same 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 most lemon i bought tea for something else 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.970
 he will go fine without this centers 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.170
 it was rightly said that the center 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 you can not just take a picture back 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.220
 well and grate to pick up the size of scars 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 different from terochku 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.040
 and the center will be this kind of powder the main thing 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.069
 so that the mold does not spoil at the bottom 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.390
 dry it on land having drunk a tight bag 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:18.459
 and you will have a reserve now 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.500
 if we have this riker ready he should and 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.380
 all just to stand up we should be important 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.120
 make sure that there is no 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.880
 undissolved sugar periodically as 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 says the president is one friendly 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.269
 countries of his regularly before troh vat and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.980
 to keep him warm while in the dark 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.810
 place 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.010
 the same thing we do here with this centers 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.209
 regular and move well week ten 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.549
 days two weeks as you wish what 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.739
 now do with lemon juice 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:03:01.260
 usually usually for limoncello 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:04.690
 prepare the syrup on the water we do with you 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.230
 lemon syrup on lemon juice 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.220
 to enhance the taste but since the juice 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.959
 very sharp sharp then sugar need 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.560
 it will be then add sugar is always easier 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.989
 Add to this all the robes which Peter 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.209
 then please remove the excess 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.079
 excess sugar so now we have to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.269
 cook syrup as it is done 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:39.420
 take a pot of stainless steel so as not to 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.420
 I burned there pour out 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.710
 says lemons well I didn't consider it right 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.320
 I do not know, and that's how much was lemon 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.730
 juice as much and then maybe 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:03.500
 have to add sugar 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:08.390
 pour out and first try to dissolve 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:15.340
 its cold it will not dissolve 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:18.910
 rather, it will remain I just explain 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.490
 we dissolve it at the bottom 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.300
 creaks and now we need it in order 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.000
 to dissolve the sugar heat 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.970
 bring to a boil so as not to covet 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.860
 to not boil to heat to full 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.260
 dissolving sugar now it's us and 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.470
 let's do so short 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.270
 thanksgiving prayers to gazprom 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.110
 turn on the stove it can do yes 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.430
 the bird does not matter and we see that 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:59.660
 we have a lot of sugar here and gradually it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:05:00.410
 stirring up, heating up and checking 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.290
 heat up 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.250
 and check how much I stayed there 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.250
 less and less and less 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.509
 so 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:33.330
 boiling do not wait carefully check on 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.750
 our here this kitchen with bloody 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.889
 there is no sugar above it 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.470
 boiling do not wait and gurgling and 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:46.000
 simultaneous work sugar completely 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.830
 dissolved our syrup is ready after 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.720
 final prayers of thanks 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:59.500
 we turn off gas to the Lord now 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.470
 altogether even with us cool it when cool 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.690
 pour it into a jar and he stands 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.710
 how long does the post he is not 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:12.400
 spoil the sort of tanks was there and sugar 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.690
 closing in the bank and he stands and he stands 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.900
 as long as we stand 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:22.360
 the center of the moonshine well if we 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.210
 we consider two weeks on the cover 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.720
 sign either with a felt pen marker meta 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:33.599
 and then we will mix 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:39.340
 compose both of these two components 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:41.349
 I can answer such questions right away 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.860
 do the same thing with oranges 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:48.430
 of course you can orange liqueur too 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.389
 getting ready but here's the orange center 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.349
 would be pretty interesting if 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.740
 add here 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:07:01.509
 if nothing big but if you 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.949
 find unpainted oranges in the video 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:06.099
 about fruit braga 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:09.250
 I showed what color is simple 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:11.860
 ugly orange they all get stained 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.550
 special chemical dye for 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:19.180
 giving a presentation and naturally 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.560
 we see such orange peel with chemistry 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.770
 by 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:27.480
 we are Old Believers thoughts of tantas 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:30.660
 we do not do anything special to add that 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.180
 Chemistry will find a good unpainted for 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:38.280
 fascists oranges please can 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.680

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.600
 Che same orange liqueur can 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.730
 in half center here 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.880
 either part add either half 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.560
 lemon zest half orange 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.090
 half a lemon with half oranges 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.690
 it will be interesting, you can always 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.900
 combine 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:58.910
 it is also possible to dry orange 

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:02.520
 zest only a single and not really well 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.440
