Matt Guff for The House Snowboard Shop. This
is the Ride Jackson BOA Coiler system. This

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.343
is a high-performance luxury boot for you.
The flex rating is a "7." It's gonna be a

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:21.840
little bit stiffer of a boot. It has an integrated
liner that's actually molded inside of the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.189
shell to reduce the amount of weight and materials
for the liner. The centered tongue is going

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.980
to stay in the center because of the internal
lockdown liner lace system. All you have to

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.050
do to tighten it is push down on the lock,
lock it, and there's actually a clip that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.690
clicks onto that tongue so it stays centered.
There's also internal "J" bars and external

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.000
"J" bars on the liners. You can see those
padded foam support systems right on the side

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.719
of the boot (and on the inside). It's plush.
When they call it a luxury boot, it feels

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.960
like luxury. This is like a little blanket.
It's going to feel great on your feet all

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.009
season long. There is quite a bit of support
in the liner. There is quite a bit of support

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:25.109
in the shell as well. The 3D formed EVA dual
density footbed is going to last you well

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:33.759
over two seasons. It also has anti-microbial
coating so the footbeds aren't going to start

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:43.149
smelling bad either. The outsole is great.
It is the Blown Light Meta outsole. This thing

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.179
is made of 100% Phylon, and there are rubber
ice picks in this as well, so you won't be

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.631
able to slip around very easy with these on.
It is actually a very, very light boot. The

00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.509
shell has the Boa Coiler system. It's just
one Boa; you click it down, turn it clockwise

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:09.030
to tighten it, and all the sudden your boots
have a nice snug fit. Now, some companies

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:19.780
do not put the closer system on the boot.
That is a system that will keep the laces

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.430
and the tongue dead center on your foot and
on the boot. Again, this is the Ride Jackson

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.030
Boa Coiler boot... Flex rating of a "7." It's
for that all mountain rider who wants a lot

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.840
of luxury. It's like the Town Car of Boots.
