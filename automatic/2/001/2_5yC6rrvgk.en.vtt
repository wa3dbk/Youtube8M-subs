00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
is considered a steal like an all red
custom<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
custom I don't really think it is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.510 
custom I don't really think it is
because<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.420> such<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> simple<00:01:40.220> custom<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.369> do

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
because it's such a simple custom to do

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.550 
because it's such a simple custom to do
maybe<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.030> painting<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> little

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
maybe like painting this was a little

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960 
maybe like painting this was a little
difficult<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> sock

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
difficult I would think like the sock

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
difficult I would think like the sock
liner<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.229> than<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:46.829> did<00:01:46.950> an

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
liner but other than that he did an

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
liner but other than that he did an
amazing<00:01:47.340> job<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.600> really
