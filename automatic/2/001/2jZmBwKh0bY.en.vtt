which is this yellow board right here

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.349 
which is this yellow board right here
this<00:00:17.010> does<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.820> unscrewed<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
this does have to be unscrewed and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.599 
this does have to be unscrewed and
removed<00:00:18.810> now<00:00:19.289> that's<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.770> difficult<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.369> do

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
removed now that's not difficult to do

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.320 
removed now that's not difficult to do
what<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.740> unplug<00:00:23.330> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
what you have to do is just unplug this

plastic tabs that you lift up and pull

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.709 
plastic tabs that you lift up and pull
out<00:00:36.260> after<00:00:37.260> doing<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.070> unscrew

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
out after doing that you just unscrew

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.500 
out after doing that you just unscrew
the<00:00:39.719> two<00:00:39.899> screws<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.910> one<00:00:41.910> screw<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.420> in

the middle and then this board slides
out<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.430> root<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.210> problem

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
out this is the the root of our problem

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.950 
out this is the the root of our problem
if<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.070> take<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> look<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.539> yes<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.930> know

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
if you can take a look here yes I know

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
if you can take a look here yes I know
Ziggy<00:00:53.930> no<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:55.199> eat<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.879> don't<00:00:56.879> eat<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Ziggy no don't eat that don't eat the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
Ziggy no don't eat that don't eat the
solder<00:00:57.360> hey<00:00:59.239> be<00:01:00.239> good<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.760> down

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
solder hey be good so if you look down

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
solder hey be good so if you look down
here<00:01:03.059> you'll<00:01:03.780> notice<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.830> reason<00:01:05.159> why

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
here you'll notice that the reason why

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.950 
here you'll notice that the reason why
our<00:01:05.489> monitor<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.000> having<00:01:06.270> trouble<00:01:06.450> powering

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
our monitor is having trouble powering

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
our monitor is having trouble powering
on<00:01:07.369> off<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> cold<00:01:09.090> start<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.930> we've

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
on off of a cold start is because we've

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.310 
on off of a cold start is because we've
got<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.619> capacitors<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.580> are<00:01:12.330> blown<00:01:12.570> now

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
got two capacitors that are blown now

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
got two capacitors that are blown now
the<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.340> determine<00:01:14.700> whether

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the way that you can determine whether

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.630 
the way that you can determine whether
or<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.330> capacitor<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.049> good<00:01:16.320> or<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
or not a capacitor is good or if it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
or not a capacitor is good or if it's
broken<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> needs<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.450> replaced<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:19.200> good

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
broken and needs to be replaced is good

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
broken and needs to be replaced is good
capacitors<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.369> these<00:01:20.610> two<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.090> here

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
capacitors like these two right here

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.520 
capacitors like these two right here
have<00:01:22.049> smooth<00:01:22.439> flat<00:01:22.799> tops<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.810> bad<00:01:24.810> capacitors

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
have smooth flat tops and bad capacitors

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
have smooth flat tops and bad capacitors
have<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> bubbling<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.729> top<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
have a bubbling on top of them and you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.510 
have a bubbling on top of them and you
can<00:01:28.439> also<00:01:28.560> notice<00:01:28.799> there's<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.340> some

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
can also notice there's actually some

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
can also notice there's actually some
browning<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
browning right here so what we have to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.200 
browning right here so what we have to
do<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.720> get<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.869> replacement<00:01:34.380> capacitors

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
do is get some replacement capacitors

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.039 
do is get some replacement capacitors
obviously<00:01:36.210> remove<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.869> old

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
obviously remove these two old

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.170 
obviously remove these two old
capacitors<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:37.770> power<00:01:37.979> supply<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
capacitors from power supply and then

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
capacitors from power supply and then
put<00:01:39.840> new<00:01:40.170> capacitors<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> replace<00:01:41.159> them

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
put new capacitors and to replace them

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.730 
put new capacitors and to replace them
that<00:01:41.729> should<00:01:41.909> fix<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> problem<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:43.649> bit

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that should fix the problem a little bit

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.889 
that should fix the problem a little bit
of<00:01:43.829> information<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.899> stock

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
of information about the stock

was made with these Chinese brand

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.999 
was made with these Chinese brand
capacitors<00:01:56.640> called<00:01:56.909> caps<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.649> which<00:01:58.649> aren't

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
capacitors called caps on which aren't

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.420 
capacitors called caps on which aren't
very<00:01:59.189> high<00:01:59.369> quality<00:01:59.659> yeah<00:02:01.189> don't<00:02:02.189> lick<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
very high quality yeah don't lick the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
very high quality yeah don't lick the
capacitor<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.579> under<00:02:05.579> certain<00:02:05.909> conditions

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
capacitor and under certain conditions

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.650 
capacitor and under certain conditions
like<00:02:06.630> heat<00:02:07.819> or<00:02:08.819> different<00:02:09.090> climates<00:02:09.479> they

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
like heat or different climates they

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
like heat or different climates they
actually<00:02:10.110> won't<00:02:10.379> last<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.890> long<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.250> they

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
actually won't last as long as they

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.700 
actually won't last as long as they
should<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:12.629> replacement<00:02:13.140> capacitor
