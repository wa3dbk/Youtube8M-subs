00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.050 
always going to touch on a bit of

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.720 
always going to touch on a bit of
everything<00:00:01.319> okay<00:00:01.740> with<00:00:01.920> only<00:00:02.100> speed<00:00:02.399> session

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
everything okay with only speed session

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.370 
everything okay with only speed session
this<00:00:02.850> week's<00:00:03.060> will<00:00:03.240> be<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> bit<00:00:04.290> of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this week's will be a bit of

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
this week's will be a bit of
acceleration<00:00:04.970> okay<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> bit<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.240> acceleration

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
acceleration okay a bit of acceleration

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.660 
acceleration okay a bit of acceleration
from<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.140> change<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.529> direction<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.189> then

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
from a change of direction and then

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.040 
from a change of direction and then
we'll<00:00:08.790> do<00:00:08.910> some<00:00:09.090> flying<00:00:09.300> runs<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.840> end

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
we'll do some flying runs at the end

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.849 
we'll do some flying runs at the end
okay<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:10.710> top<00:00:10.860> running<00:00:11.070> speed<00:00:15.470> we<00:00:16.470> usually

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
okay for top running speed we usually

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
okay for top running speed we usually
split<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> training<00:00:17.820> institute<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.480> short

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
split the training institute of short

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.580 
split the training institute of short
week<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> week<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.320> competition

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
week this week because of competition

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.150 
week this week because of competition
but<00:00:19.980> usually<00:00:20.310> we'll<00:00:20.430> look<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.930> acceleration

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
but usually we'll look at acceleration

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
but usually we'll look at acceleration
in<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.369> session<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> mechanics

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
in one session and the mechanics

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.790 
in one session and the mechanics
involved<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.380> we'll<00:00:25.590> look<00:00:25.680> at

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
involved in that and then we'll look at

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
involved in that and then we'll look at
max<00:00:25.980> velocity<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.519> upright<00:00:27.000> sprinting<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
max velocity so upright sprinting in the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
max velocity so upright sprinting in the
second<00:00:28.439> session<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> other<00:00:29.039> session<00:00:29.369> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
second session or the other session in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.310 
second session or the other session in
the<00:00:29.519> week<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:30.240> we've<00:00:30.359> done<00:00:30.480> today<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> bit

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the week what we've done today is a bit

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680 
the week what we've done today is a bit
of<00:00:31.439> both<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:32.040> we've<00:00:32.189> tried<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.510> revisit<00:00:33.510> some

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
of both what we've tried to revisit some

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.819 
of both what we've tried to revisit some
of<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> stuff<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.079> done<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> previous

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
of the stuff we've done in previous

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.090 
of the stuff we've done in previous
weeks<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.239> would<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.809> ideal

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
weeks on what would be the ideal

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.160 
weeks on what would be the ideal
acceleration<00:00:38.420> model<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.020> would<00:00:40.140> look

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
acceleration model what that would look

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
acceleration model what that would look
like<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.219> bolt<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.180> rugby

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like and then bolt that on to rugby

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.090 
like and then bolt that on to rugby
specific<00:00:43.170> movements<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.649> today<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.010> were

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
specific movements that today we were

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
specific movements that today we were
doing<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.399> cutting<00:00:44.820> from<00:00:45.140> reactions

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
doing some cutting from reactions

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.700 
doing some cutting from reactions
basically<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.920> trying<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> tag<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
basically so trying to tag on that the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
basically so trying to tag on that the
skills<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> they've<00:00:50.280> learned<00:00:50.309> onto<00:00:51.000> some<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
skills that they've learned onto some of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.310 
skills that they've learned onto some of
the<00:00:51.329> work<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> ball<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.960> hand

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the work with the ball in hand

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
the work with the ball in hand
okay<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.160> him<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> visual<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
okay just use him as a visual about this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
okay just use him as a visual about this
space<00:00:54.690> away<00:00:55.079> where<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> wouldn't<00:00:55.739> put<00:00:56.010> your

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
space away where you wouldn't put your

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
space away where you wouldn't put your
arm<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:56.449> okay<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> cut

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
arm up okay where you're going to cut

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.869 
arm up okay where you're going to cut
outside<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.770> arm<00:00:58.920> frame<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> boys<00:00:59.699> on

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
outside that arm frame so the boys on

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.950 
outside that arm frame so the boys on
the<00:00:59.910> cones<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the cones are going to be there as a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.460 
the cones are going to be there as a
visual<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.469> arms<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.670> hands<00:01:03.090> okay<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
visual with arms out to hands okay you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
visual with arms out to hands okay you
look<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.970> 45<00:01:05.970> degrees<00:01:06.390> plant<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> foot<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
look into 45 degrees plant the foot but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.660 
look into 45 degrees plant the foot but
get<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.860> shoulders<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
the exit for the first three steps go

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
the exit for the first three steps go
firstly<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.200> sprinting<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.130> improve<00:01:26.580> speed

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
firstly we're sprinting to improve speed

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
firstly we're sprinting to improve speed
times<00:01:27.090> secondly<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> help<00:01:28.350> with

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
times secondly it's going to help with

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
times secondly it's going to help with
injury<00:01:28.770> prevention<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.939> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
injury prevention as well with you have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
injury prevention as well with you have
to<00:01:30.299> run<00:01:30.450> faster<00:01:30.990> indoor<00:01:31.409> running<00:01:31.829> fast<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to run faster indoor running fast so

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
to run faster indoor running fast so
that's<00:01:32.820> another<00:01:33.090> part<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.840> because

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that's another part of it but because

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.340 
that's another part of it but because
it's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> multi-directional<00:01:35.040> sport<00:01:35.670> there's

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's a multi-directional sport there's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.960 
it's a multi-directional sport there's
auditory<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> visual<00:01:38.040> reactions<00:01:38.729> involved

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
auditory and visual reactions involved
