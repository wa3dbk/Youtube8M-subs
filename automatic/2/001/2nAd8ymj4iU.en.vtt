that chest the other side here this is

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.879 
that chest the other side here this is
another<00:05:28.580> tier<00:05:28.939> two<00:05:29.090> guys<00:05:29.449> so<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:30.589> is

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
another tier two guys so this is

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.390 
another tier two guys so this is
incredible<00:05:31.879> for<00:05:31.940> routan<00:05:32.479> have<00:05:32.659> it<00:05:32.839> ready<00:05:33.080> is

incredible for routan have it ready is

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.709 
incredible for routan have it ready is
so<00:05:34.400> what<00:05:34.550> I'd<00:05:34.639> normally<00:05:34.849> do<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.300> just<00:05:35.509> jump

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719 
so what I'd normally do is I just jump

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.170 
so what I'd normally do is I just jump
out<00:05:35.810> this<00:05:35.960> balcony<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.680> then<00:05:37.490> you've<00:05:37.909> got

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
out this balcony and then you've got

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.480 
out this balcony and then you've got
you've<00:05:39.080> got<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.379> route<00:05:39.589> back<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.159> beach
