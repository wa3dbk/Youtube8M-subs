with<00:00:57.589> HC<00:00:57.949> just<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.369> you<00:00:58.610> know<00:00:58.640> get<00:00:58.909> some<00:00:59.059> energy

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.600 

now<00:01:03.290> he's<00:01:03.530> a<00:01:03.619> shadow<00:01:03.949> ball<00:01:04.159> again<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.489> think

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
now he's a shadow ball again I think

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.000 
now he's a shadow ball again I think
he's<00:01:04.940> going<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.119> continue<00:01:05.630> using<00:01:05.869> that<00:01:06.080> all

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
he's going to continue using that all

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.920 
he's going to continue using that all
he's<00:01:07.220> giga<00:01:07.430> drain<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.909> probably<00:01:08.540> thinking<00:01:08.840> why

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
he's giga drain I probably thinking why

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.020 
he's giga drain I probably thinking why
he's<00:01:09.080> giga<00:01:09.350> drain<00:01:09.500> off<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.979> had<00:01:10.490> sludge<00:01:10.790> bomb

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
he's giga drain off I had sludge bomb

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.609 
he's giga drain off I had sludge bomb
that's<00:01:11.570> probably<00:01:11.869> not<00:01:12.080> going<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.290> do<00:01:12.439> as<00:01:12.590> much

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
that's probably not going to do as much

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.230 
that's probably not going to do as much
anyway<00:01:13.130> might<00:01:13.430> as<00:01:13.460> well<00:01:13.640> use<00:01:13.820> something<00:01:14.210> that

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
anyway might as well use something that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.899 
anyway might as well use something that
gives<00:01:14.479> me<00:01:14.689> HP<00:01:15.080> back<00:01:15.260> so<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:16.400> why<00:01:16.549> I<00:01:16.580> usually

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
gives me HP back so that's why I usually

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.609 
gives me HP back so that's why I usually
do<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:18.850> okay<00:01:19.850> I'll<00:01:19.970> call<00:01:20.150> back<00:01:20.390> Senate<00:01:21.260> umbreon

booster so i'll send out Gigaton again

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.170 
booster so i'll send out Gigaton again
because<00:02:36.310> probably<00:02:37.310> doesn't<00:02:37.549> have<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:38.030> many

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
because probably doesn't have that many

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.570 
because probably doesn't have that many
attacks<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.840> are<00:02:38.900> effective<00:02:39.769> and<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.430> give

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
attacks that are effective and so give

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.030 
attacks that are effective and so give
me<00:02:40.610> some<00:02:40.700> time<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.030> get<00:02:41.269> out<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.600> sleep

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
me some time to get out of the sleep

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.240 
me some time to get out of the sleep
crap<00:02:43.040> all<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> dryer<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.940> demolisher<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
crap all the dryer is demolisher is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.410 
crap all the dryer is demolisher is
really<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.489> leave<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> dent<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.120> me<00:02:47.269> so

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
really going to leave a dent in me so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.620 
really going to leave a dent in me so
i'll<00:02:47.540> call<00:02:47.780> gigaton<00:02:48.260> back<00:02:48.440> set<00:02:48.920> up<00:02:48.950> umbreon

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
i'll call gigaton back set up umbreon

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.509 
i'll call gigaton back set up umbreon
because<00:02:50.739> umbreon<00:02:51.739> can<00:02:51.920> pretty<00:02:52.070> much<00:02:52.190> take<00:02:52.459> a

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
because umbreon can pretty much take a

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920 
because umbreon can pretty much take a
lot<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.760> hits

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
lot of hits

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.069 
lot of hits
so<00:02:54.930> that's<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:56.030> thunderpunch<00:02:57.030> umbreon<00:02:57.840> hangs

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
so that's a thunderpunch umbreon hangs

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.630 
so that's a thunderpunch umbreon hangs
in<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.349> paralyzed<00:02:59.689> synchronize<00:03:00.689> gets<00:03:01.019> back

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
mistake on my part I should've used

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.140 
mistake on my part I should've used
close<00:05:13.500> combat<00:05:13.770> instead<00:05:14.340> I'll<00:05:14.880> have<00:05:15.000> to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
close combat instead I'll have to

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.519 
close combat instead I'll have to
remember<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.450> next<00:05:15.660> time

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
remember that next time

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.719 
remember that next time
so<00:05:18.309> okay<00:05:18.549> temp<00:05:18.969> to<00:05:19.149> send<00:05:19.359> out<00:05:19.449> cruncher<00:05:19.809> again

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
so okay temp to send out cruncher again

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.819 
so okay temp to send out cruncher again
good<00:05:21.729> thing<00:05:21.879> I'm<00:05:21.999> faster<00:05:22.449> so<00:05:22.809> i<00:05:23.139> use<00:05:23.589> crunch

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:23.829 
good thing I'm faster so i use crunch

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:28.519 
good thing I'm faster so i use crunch
finishing<00:05:24.339> off

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.220 

sends<00:05:29.339> out<00:05:29.489> for<00:05:29.939> less

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230

I think I'm still fat no crap is fool
ass<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:35.010> faster<00:05:35.600> otherwise<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.720> was<00:05:36.840> gonna<00:05:36.960> go

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
ass is faster otherwise I was gonna go

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.470 
ass is faster otherwise I was gonna go
for<00:05:37.290> crunch<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:38.580> be<00:05:38.700> super<00:05:39.000> effective<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:42.270> I'm
