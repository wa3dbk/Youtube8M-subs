ago it came into the US and then we

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.800

designed a shoe called the F light it
was<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> mountain<00:00:39.170> racing<00:00:39.560> shoe<00:00:39.740> so<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.460> goal

was a mountain racing shoe so the goal

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.880 
was a mountain racing shoe so the goal
of<00:00:41.060> that<00:00:41.090> shoe<00:00:41.570> was<00:00:42.140> just<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.470> be<00:00:42.590> something

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
of that shoe was just to be something

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.190 
of that shoe was just to be something
super<00:00:43.310> light<00:00:43.490> grippy<00:00:44.060> on<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.810> the<00:00:45.020> rocks

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
super light grippy on the on the rocks

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.730 
super light grippy on the on the rocks
could<00:00:45.920> wear<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.160> on<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> trails<00:00:46.610> and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
could wear it on the trails and

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.980 
could wear it on the trails and
crossfitter<00:00:48.740> started<00:00:49.100> wearing<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.180> that's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
crossfitter started wearing it so that's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.120 
crossfitter started wearing it so that's
kind<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:51.820> started<00:00:52.820> our<00:00:53.150> fitness<00:00:53.510> site<00:00:54.130> so

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
kind of what started our fitness site so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.490 
kind of what started our fitness site so

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
the reason CrossFitters really liked our

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.350 
the reason CrossFitters really liked our
f<00:00:57.710> lights<00:00:57.980> is<00:00:58.220> because<00:00:58.640> they're<00:00:58.850> super<00:00:59.150> low<00:00:59.300> to

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
f lights is because they're super low to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.180 
f lights is because they're super low to
the<00:00:59.420> ground<00:00:59.480> when<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.500> comes<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.740> CrossFit

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
the ground when it comes to CrossFit

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.370 
the ground when it comes to CrossFit
you're<00:01:01.370> dealing<00:01:01.670> with<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:01.790> lot<00:01:02.000> of<00:01:02.030> weight<00:01:02.380> do

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
you're dealing with a lot of weight do

Rope tech feature so you can kind of see

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.190 
Rope tech feature so you can kind of see
it<00:01:29.450> here<00:01:30.189> what<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:31.340> does<00:01:31.700> before<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.869> just

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
it here what this does before it just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.270 
it here what this does before it just
had<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:34.749> just<00:01:35.749> typical<00:01:36.289> foam<00:01:36.590> on<00:01:36.859> the<00:01:36.979> bottom

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
had the just typical foam on the bottom

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.620 
had the just typical foam on the bottom
there<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:37.909> happens<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.420> when<00:01:38.539> you're

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
there and what happens is when you're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.800 
there and what happens is when you're
doing<00:01:38.719> a<00:01:38.869> rope<00:01:39.049> climb<00:01:39.289> you're<00:01:40.069> gonna<00:01:40.159> target

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
doing a rope climb you're gonna target

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.050 
doing a rope climb you're gonna target
the<00:01:41.810> rope<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.259> between<00:01:42.679> your<00:01:43.039> feet<00:01:43.249> and<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the rope in between your feet and so

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.910 
the rope in between your feet and so
this<00:01:44.270> actually<00:01:44.630> becomes<00:01:44.899> kind<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.350> break<00:01:45.679> on

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
this actually becomes kind of a break on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.440 
this actually becomes kind of a break on
the<00:01:46.039> way<00:01:46.159> down<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.789> really<00:01:47.030> important<00:01:47.420> to

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the way down this is really important to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.319 
the way down this is really important to
have<00:01:47.979> otherwise<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.249> will<00:01:49.399> chew<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> hole<00:01:50.210> in

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329

that's<00:03:52.120> lighter<00:03:52.450> than<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.780> men's<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.290> is

six millimeter heel to toe drop so it's

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.120 
six millimeter heel to toe drop so it's
still<00:03:55.660> pretty<00:03:55.780> minimal<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.980> most

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
still pretty minimal it's not the most

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.150 
still pretty minimal it's not the most
minimum<00:03:57.870> but<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:58.900> makes<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.350> more<00:03:59.560> perfect<00:04:00.100> for

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
minimum but it makes it more perfect for

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.069 
minimum but it makes it more perfect for
that<00:04:00.670> person<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.359> wants<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.660> for<00:04:01.780> an<00:04:01.900> every

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
that person that wants it for an every

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.300 
that person that wants it for an every
day's<00:04:02.230> because<00:04:02.650> then<00:04:02.799> they<00:04:02.890> have<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.070> little

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
day's because then they have a little

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.460 
day's because then they have a little
bit<00:04:03.549> marker<00:04:03.880> underneath<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.540> heel<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:05.290> can

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
bit marker underneath the heel you can

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.920 
bit marker underneath the heel you can
put<00:04:05.769> your<00:04:05.980> insoles<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.579> there<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.329> again<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
put your insoles in there but again the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.240 
put your insoles in there but again the
idea<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.470> shoe<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.859> to<00:04:09.010> kind<00:04:09.220> of

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
idea of the shoe is to kind of

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.090 
idea of the shoe is to kind of
strengthen<00:04:09.850> your<00:04:09.970> feet<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:11.049> can<00:04:11.739> kind<00:04:11.980> of

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
strengthen your feet so you can kind of

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.210 
strengthen your feet so you can kind of
recommend<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.910> they<00:04:13.060> maybe<00:04:13.680> start<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:15.010> lean

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
recommend that they maybe start to lean

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.639 
recommend that they maybe start to lean
themselves
