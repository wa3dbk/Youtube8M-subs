00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.959
 Leo Beenhakker almost three hours before the Western world without a stadium that says something 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.390
 Which 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.009
 yes still says alive 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
 but we knew that for weeks 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.710
 it is not a Christmas tree 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 in a good way 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 that has been going on for quite a while actually 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.060
 take part in the qualification 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.540
 yes that is a football country 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
 it is more important for that price in our pocket that we are there 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 said it before 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.990
 ger thijs times that you have been outside europe he tried to quit this way 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 you already in all kinds of ways 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.620
 both for the rich 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.520
 football is for illegal immigrants 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.020
 football is that read our 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.200
 hundreds of people and you can see you beating again 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.620
 the impact of football 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.110
 throughout the entire entire society every heat set up a surprise 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.600
 how many people 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.950
 anyway 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.390
 upside down to what playing football remains a phenomenon 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.550
 the coach's peak 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.980
 yes it is so just I am just very focused but it is not me 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.190
 i had it at that time i had that sounds a bit blase but it is not 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.740
 just like that 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 yes i think i stayed on your gaze all day 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 certainly possible to respond to the match 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.840
 all changes already done is the word but that is just a matter of your life 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.720
 in such a competition 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.100
 I do not have anymore 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.880
 nervously signed I generally do not have that uncertainty 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.550
 more to mention his role but feeling 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.570
 but I am very real indeed 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060
 also involved the game 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 apart from the hectic pace and tension surrounding the competition, you can also enjoy it 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.750
 f 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.890
 to you in part i don't have i so i am always very busy to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.660
 see where you yourself have always been this way I am busy they were already 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.940
 to remedy 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.070
 and where it can be better a bank otherwise the ps can concentrate tough or 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.149
 everyone does what he has to do 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.379
 how much bit different must be done on another player was 9 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.589
 usually i have 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.299
 then found 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.739
 the day to sleep never a play i already have another room three times 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.579
 looks ahead at all times can not be very strange in years 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.869
 a strange story but it is done 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.129
 it was me 6
