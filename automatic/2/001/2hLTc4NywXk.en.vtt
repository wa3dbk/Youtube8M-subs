00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi to all that giuseppe mele boys 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.950
 welcome to this new video by 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.540
 information on assassin's creed unity 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.429
 we will analyze a published video together 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 recently from the ubisoft in which it is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.070
 You can finally see the mode 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.080
 co op 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.519
 a stealth mission to steal pensions 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 they will be a kind of missions indeed 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 very particular in which we will have to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 apparently find artifacts e 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 above all we will have to do it without 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 alert the enemy guards and the video 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.539
 start with what appears to be the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.189
 home screen of the game and much 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.840
 it will probably be the one we will see 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.500
 also in the final version of the game 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 same 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.920
 we are immediately shown a large one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.600
 structure that turns out to be a hospital 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.969
 the first images that are shown 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.140
 demonstrate technical sector 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.640
 from the exceptional fact you notice all the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.379
 details such as the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.030
 fog or the strong one of places to which 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 let's see just inside the city 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.420
 after having pursued a sato of faith i 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.280
 characters playing from in v 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 to infiltrate an enemy area 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 it will be essential to use the eye 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.230
 of the curia in the video called 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 strangely team spirit through 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 which to be able to identify all the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 enemies in the area so as to bypass them 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.430
 and avoiding problems proves to be a lot 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.899
 Also useful is a new skill introduced 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.160
 in assassin's for unity in fact I'm 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.629
 speaking of the possibility of 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 crouch because this way 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.560
 much faster and above all direct 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.060
 hide behind a wall or otherwise 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 a small structure in such a way as to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.450
 not to be identified after a short one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 game phase and assassins move 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 in the basements and take two roads 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700
 different indeed the first decides to do 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.350
 the wide lap so as to eliminate 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 enemies in the area while the second 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 killer decides to advance in a way 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.570
 such as to break open a closed door 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 this is a totally new mechanic 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.540
 introduced precisely in this chapter e 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 I'm sure we can unlock it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.140
 only advancing inside the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 emissions a particular look goes 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.439
 to the map at the bottom left which 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.689
 to the selection of weapons at the bottom 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.759
 on the right they seem to be much more between 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 Futuristic quotes and above all 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.240
 they seem to offer a lot of consultation 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.009
 simpler and more immediate than ours 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.149
 position of the instruments of death a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.860
 our provision 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.830
 after a brief phase of guest gameplay 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.150
 similar arrive 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.040
 the room in which the casket is present 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.750
 with the artifacts among other things the latter 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.430
 is guarded by two guards then the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.620
 first assassin decides to throw one 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.570
 smoke bomb while the second makes one 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.310
 sort of board ii role really a lot 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.080
 detail especially more fluid than 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.060
 those seen in the past is possible 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.780
 then recovered artifacts and escape 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.490
 from the area 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.350
 in the video it is specified that this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 kind of stealth missions will be possible 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.770
 repeat several times to get new ones 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.870
 abilities and above all new pieces 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.460
 of armor to customize have 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.320
 they will also have to have a high degree 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.390
 of replayability because every time 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.920
 we will start everything will be disposed so 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.330
 different so this means that it 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.680
 casket as well as the guards yes 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.120
 will find in different areas 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 I can't wait to get my hands on 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.270
 assassin's creed unity because how 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.860
 you know, really a lot will come 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.780
 video on the game starting from a good one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.700
 through history secret guides 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.350
 ex so really a lot of things there 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.030
 will accompany precisely with this new 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.560
 chapter I'll do pretty much the same 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.970
 what with assassin's creed and rob 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.830
 clearly after I finish 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.360

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.830
