00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 I do not lie defenseless undecided today. 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.069
 hair tutorial day here on the channel 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.170
 to teach you a half trapped braid 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 built in and I want to leave my 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 Congratulations to the cleanings that are 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.080
 venturing into the inlaid braid that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.789
 finally got very tired 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 proud of you but for you that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.060
 not yet understood with the braid 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.619
 Can be reassured that I go 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 show you in quite detail how 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 do this today's hairstyle so you 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 Understand right and train your house. 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 to do too, I'll be beautiful, I have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 sure but start now and it 's not because 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.590
 our half-trapped hair that we do not 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 You have to be careful about what's left. 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 subject then today our focus is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.640
 hydration is the most hair discipline 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.559
 soft because of course this all helps 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.200
 in the result then today care in the bath 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 was to conclude intense hydration that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 take care of my scalp you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.160
 you know I need this kind of care and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 besides this careful hydration of the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.370
 replenishment of hydration 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 we will also apply two 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.289
 growth of an oil longlines 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.080
 mix before applying the police and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 already applied from compliance to the tips 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 so that this hair has a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.049
 lasting result even if you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.430
 the contact with moisture 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.860
 the hair it gets much more 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.530
 disciplined people already return brightness 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 But that's all we love. 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.600
 we are very ready in the cleanings between 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.610
 the leaders also ready to start 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.750
 our tools and today I love your 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 hairstyles that we do not need 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 practically nothing then you need 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 separating an elastic band may be 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.320
 color of your hair and only 1 grampinho 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.180
 a clip in her hair was already 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.659
 divided in the middle people now I'm going to start 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.280
 To work that side, then you? 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.990
 separates a wick 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.930
 It does not have to be too much of a child, it can not be 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.759
 an average mecha we divide we have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.100
 three equal parts we braid of 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 go inside normally do more 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.049
 close to the head today and now 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 The third gear is back to the class with 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.090
 plus a little hair 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.530
 and the next move she just does not have one more 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.110
 little hair too and pass there 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.540
 inside 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.550
 Same thing together but hair can 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.820
 be a little bit weird and braid now 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 come more hair do not have more hair 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.120
 with this spot and continue until you reach 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 in the ear 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.440
 I got here in the ear continues 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.450
 transiting without being inlaid braid her 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.209
 follow simple and you pull back there 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.070
 I learned from china grammar 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.050
 resting while we prepare the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.510
 the other side and now we do the same 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.390
 thing on the other side is a chance of you 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.390
 recapitulate this step by step I will 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.540
 share this stir 3 to start 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.820
 usually running third gear 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.440
 brings a friend reminds you that the braid 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.480
 built a warm friend that she 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.300
 She never comes back to the class alone, she always does. 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:14.500
 brings a friend along and together one more 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:17.690
 and we're still braiding until we 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.489
 almost down enough to 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.190
 find our other deal 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.570
 waiting and we'll hold this side with 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.510
 elastic I'm going to give a hint is 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.090
 cool, the finishing people for you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.269
 so leave it well prezinho before 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.370
 join who will make us go 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.989
 loosen our child without fear of being 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.360
 Happy if we do not need to 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.100
 worry because it does not spoil to accommodate 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.320
 an illusion of much more hair to people 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.870
 My hair is so thin and now we 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.310
 does the same thing with the other side is 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.650
 important for that little group 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.269
 It is antithetical to ensure that 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.610
 is coming the screen brings to you 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.100
 able to give me even when you 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.380
 does the other side after I 've learned 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.630
 she had a case please put this 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.430
 effect that gives more visual 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.730
 Now we put her together. 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.769
 Tongs pulls the tongs and I go 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.129
