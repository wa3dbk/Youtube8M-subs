00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 politours today pits that welcome to the 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.990
 review of the f2000 if they are new by 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.700
 here remember that these videos are not 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.199
 to demonstrate skills but so that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.490
 see how the weapon works in the hands of 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.139
 an average wimp like I am 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.699
 also forget to comment with a weapon that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 would like to see in review in some future 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.119
 close after we finish with the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.160
 soft dry weapons or the word of the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.929
 day is fish and if you do not know why 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.380
 it's fish let's start with the review of the 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.939
 fn rifle 2000 this rifle the rifle 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.230
 fish as I like to call it by the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.150
 so peculiar that it has is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 manufactured by fn herstal in the country of 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.640
 belgium and is in service since 2001 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 uses the ordinary ammunition of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.340
 5.56 x 45 millimeters of NATO with one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.740
 15 10 shots equal to that of the game with 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 850 shots per minute then we passed 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.790
 what will banfield 4 be like 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.230
 unlock are first requirements and 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.910
 then the requirements can already do 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.740
 a mission to unlock it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.590
 what are the requirements that are for 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.030
 the least level 10 in his game and then 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.740
 of that that also has the pack of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.329
 expansion is known is if you 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.250
 they bought it separately or they have it 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.040
 premium can do the mission that they 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.110
 will give this f2000 what it consists of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 in killing six enemies with rifle 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.649
 assault that is a gallon 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.210
 of rifle assault and after that in a 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.740
 single game they need to kill 10 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.929
 people inside the facilities of the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 subway operation meter and have 2 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.979
 gallons of assists ie 10 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 death assists what I did was 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 get me to a subway server with 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.140
 many tickets grabbed a rifle 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 designated shooter fired two shots at 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.229
 opponents to stay 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 practically one or two bullets to die 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.140
 and that my team did the rest of the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 I work the best they can do to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.130
 that works better is always to be 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.869
 next to two or three people about 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 everything from your patrol if they do all 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.200
 the previous steps should already have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.149
 f2000 then we have the address to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.319
 the statistics the damage is 25 points 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.090
 of damage among the first eight 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.679
 meters a death of four shots nothing 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.539
 especially like its damage 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.179
 minimum of 18 points of damage ie one 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.610
 death of 6 shots after 55 meters 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.469
 in design mobility and all 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 that's a gun bomb I thought the charger 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.739
 is behind the trigger which means 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.599
 which is very compact and has a good 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.700
 shot of the hip but a little less 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.739
 of precision from the look alike 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 It has including a look 1.6 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.549
 default that could be useful if you 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.560
 they do not like iron mines in what 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.239
 particular we prefer to use it in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.100
 instead of iron mines however 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.300
 is not very useful because of the type of weapon and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.860
 the shooting pattern 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.840
 the roles that it fulfills once you 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.400
 they unlock it for the first time has 30 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 bullets in the charger plus one in the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.240
 chamber and its recharge is very slow 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.820
 2.7 seconds when you still have some collateral 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.890
 in the bedroom and 3.9 seconds have been 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.840
 finished all the bullets the moral is 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.600
 do not run out all the bullets do not 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.580
 they deserve to waste 1.2 seconds more than 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.670
 game the cadence of shots is like 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.460
 something relative between an m16 and weapons of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 higher cadence like like a 971 or in the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.530
 famas with 850 shots per minute the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.170
 600 meters bullet speed 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.690
 second is really on par with your role 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.790
 in the game that is not for long 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.380
 long distances but they will not either 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.450
 problems to shoot enemies in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.280
 movement at medium distances and not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 only automatic and semi modes 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.150
 automatic and the automatic des is 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.740
 relative to medium distances and that of 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.750
 semi-automatic really with a 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.910
 high rate it is not convenient to use the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.530
 semiautomatic mode shooting pattern 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.970
 here you start to put the good thing in 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.100
 about the pattern or shot the precision 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.050
 because because he has point 24 towards 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.760
 up is the lowest of all 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.650
 full high then do not worry 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.300
 by controlling the pattern up 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.230
 to the left and to the right is 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.849
 the problem why 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.430
 as a small version of fame 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.019
 point 4 to the left point 5 to the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.760
 right which means that to long 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.379
 distances will be much problem 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.060
 even half distances sometimes is 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.860
 a problem if you do not grab the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.840
 practice or do not know how to start 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.280
 control it and if that was not enough, 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.290
 multiplier of the first shot is 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.660
 say how much more moves the weapon 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.120
 then in those directions the first 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.590
 shot is 3 times more but despite 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.450
 that is three times more if you 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.220
 they want to control the ied this weapon to 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.840
 greater distances I recommend them 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 only make small bursts 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.090
 imagine that it is the one in 94 below and 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.519
 36 who played it and play to shoot 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.379
 two bullets three bullets that way did not 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.420
 will feel so strong in the kick because 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.220
 they will be able to control that firing pattern 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.989
 a little smaller however they are going to 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.940
 about 12 meters go completely in 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.280
 clear automatic is if you see several 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.320
 enemies at once make small bursts 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.820
 he even shortened distances so he does not 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.229
 they finish the bullets mentioned to the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.180
 principle that being a model goal by 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.910
 the precision is changed ie 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.440
 from the sight is point 25 on the rifle 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.760
 average assault is from point 2 the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.530
 precision from the look among more 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.800
 close to 0 is the perfection of 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.780
 2.25 precision from the hip 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.310
 rather better than 3 of the full 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.900
 high average as you can realize 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.240
 all these characteristics make 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.979
 this weapon is only combat 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.539
 close as in some other way 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.639
 they would be deficient and they would be 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.229
 disadvantage by the time then how 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.909
 we can make this weapon work that 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.860
 is not so different from all the others and 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.840
 can put it on par and be of some 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.729
 Competitive way unam and points 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.440
 holographic red dot lion is 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.210
 excellent do not need more with this 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.270
 shooting pattern can not be controlled 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.759
 more a compensator definitely that 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.889
 incredibly improves the weapon and a handle 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.870
 thick because because the precision of a 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.330
 rifle ball pop is bad then 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.669
 adding a thick handle at least 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.289
 we compensate and put it almost on par 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.599
 of what would be an assault rifle 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.879
 average and in addition to that we add a 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.620
 compensator then imagine the damage 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.900
 and the penalty that we would have if not 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.270
 we add a thick handle to a ball weapon 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.789
 pop with a compensator and finally for 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.740
 complement the fishing of this weapon and of 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.289
 that is very mobile a laser sight is 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.060
 excellent so let's advocate both 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.310
 sides because they should use this weapon 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.260
 and why they should not use it 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.910
 first it has a very good cadence and 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.400
 It is an excellent alternative to what they would be 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.640
 weapons of higher cadence such as the 971 eca 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.500
 or the famas for example and that also not 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.600
 wants to use weapons of so little and so 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.720
 low cadence between quotation marks like what 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.670
 would be the in 416 second the pattern 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.290
 vertical is very controllable seriously if 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.310
 you manage to correct the pattern towards 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.740
 the sides that is the hardest 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.170
 generally the vertical pattern is not 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.360
 some problem after a good shot 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.760
 of hip a ball pop gun that comes from 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.830
 drawer and an extra added sight that yes 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.020
 well they do not like the options of a 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.180
 look at 1 x as the red dot does not 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.240
 like the iron look or want to spend 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.860
 from there to 3.4 x a look like your own 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.690
 of the f2000 can be an option for 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.280
 you now let's talk about the cons or 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.770
 why they should not use this weapon or 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.690
 use another one instead of this number 1 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.100
 the recharge is very similar to famas and 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.930
 although if we are talking about the 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.120
 terms because I do not better use the afa 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.820
 more precision not as good as others 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.830
 rifles even from here 931 with greater 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.590
 cadence has in theory more precision 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.630
 that this one and number three the kicks 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.000
 horizontal we return to the example of the 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.010
 there is 971 that has a better pattern 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.750
 to the side and therefore more controllable 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.670
 who is to whom I recommend this weapon 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.020
 to all those rebels who do not 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.970
 like to use the same weapon that 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.870
 others and who does not want to use a 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.760
 23 a scholarship 931 of a plus in another 36 what 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.980
 that you have looked like them I can 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.660
 recommend this weapon but nevertheless 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.700
 if they want to be more competitive in 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.370
 close combat is much better fame or 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.410
 like a 971 at greater distances and to 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.940
 once in close combat or if whoever has 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.770
 a little more range can use a 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.090
 9 416 or something similar 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.770
 for this reason this weapon will give you a 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.870
 rating of 3 slices of pizza 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.370
 about 4 because it is highly recommended is 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.840
 very enjoyable and I did not have any 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.700
 problem to take out the gameplay in fact 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.140
 I took it out very fast but it's useless 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.030
 be a good weapon if there can be other 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.710
 weapons that can dull the most is 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.600
 issue of personal preference so 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.980
 you are the judges tell me how 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.540
 it seems to them maybe I am being too 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.250
 rude because it's not as good as 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.840
 banfield 3 and I hope you liked it 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.120
 the review and especially that it was 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.470
 useful for you consider subscribe 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.820

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.140
 when it comes out and if you do not know if 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.370
 subscribe or can not review the 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.050
 other videos that I have in the channel for 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.760
 to convince social networks is 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.289

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.680
 next 

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:50.430
 all right

 all right
