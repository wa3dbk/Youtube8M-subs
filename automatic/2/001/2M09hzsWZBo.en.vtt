00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
satisfied with it it could have been

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
satisfied with it it could have been
better<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:09.150> really

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
better but that's not a really really

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
better but that's not a really really
big<00:01:09.600> deal<00:01:09.840> cuz<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> mouse<00:01:10.860> works

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
big deal cuz you know the mouse works

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
big deal cuz you know the mouse works
and<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.520> gets<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> job<00:01:11.909> done<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.450> what

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and it gets the job done and that's what

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
and it gets the job done and that's what
really<00:01:12.930> does<00:01:13.200> matter<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.979> far<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> design

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
really does matter as far as the design

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
really does matter as far as the design
goes<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.900> only<00:01:16.020> part<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> master<00:01:16.860> I'd

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
goes the only part of the master I'd

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310 
goes the only part of the master I'd
really<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.360> part<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really don't like is the top part the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
really don't like is the top part the
