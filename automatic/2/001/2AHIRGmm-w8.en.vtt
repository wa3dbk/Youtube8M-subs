00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Song of the people 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.339
 Jin Pei's Lyrics: "Do You Hear the People Sing" 

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:12.912
 See the people are fighting for justice and freedom. 

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:19.519
 The sound of the song is full of fire and shock 

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:25.358
 Defending human rights to protect all sentient beings regardless of society or individual 

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:31.831
 Can be called infinite ideal daily asymptotic daily 

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:38.338
 The people’s willingness to practice freedom is not afraid of curbing 

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:44.511
 I am willing to bravely carry this revolutionary banner every moment. 

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:49.516
 Forget to fear the brave step before welcoming history 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.156
 See the people are fighting for justice and freedom. 

00:00:56.156 --> 00:01:01.828
 The sound of the song is full of fire and shock 

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:07.901
 Defending human rights to protect all sentient beings regardless of society or individual 

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:14.140
 Can be called infinite ideal daily asymptotic daily 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.246
 The people’s willingness to practice freedom is not afraid of curbing 

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:26.553
 I am willing to bravely carry this revolutionary banner every moment. 

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:32.125
 Forget to fear the brave step before welcoming history 

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:37.764
 See the people are fighting for justice and freedom. 

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:43.970
 The sound of the song is full of fire and shock 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.976
 Defending human rights to protect all sentient beings regardless of society or individual 

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:56.820
 Can be called infinite ideal daily asymptotic daily 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:17.504
 Can be called infinite ideal daily asymptotic daily
