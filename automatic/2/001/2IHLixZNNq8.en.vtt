00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 imagine it was everyone had this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.730
 faculty we would spend 2.6 billion 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 from men to several hundred 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.000
 billions of living beings to be able 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.740
 communicate exchange live frederic 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.449
 chesneau is one of those sums having 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 developed language skills 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.800
 out of the ordinary 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.039
 he speaks the language of the bears 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.610
 I speak the bear fatally yes yes yes 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.880
 where the bear by the month he speaks the month 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.469
 but we're talking to each other that's obvious we 've 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.410
 a communication we have a whole system 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.940
 good to us 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 is it ultrasound 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 infrasound follow a scientist I 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 know nothing but I know very well that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.160
 certain frequencies in the attics 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.600
 are going to induce some things 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 if I go in the treble would have raised 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.379
 killed in the rubble reassures herself she 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 back to the contact 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.739
 there is really a little bit of language 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.000
 that we have established together that we 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.920
 knows less look at the slightest gesture 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.689
 that's what's going to happen I can 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.790
 induce behavior in her little 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.790
 to induce at home we know each other super 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.920
 I must be a bear with a map 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.800
 identity of the main square 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.290
 so what do I do the bear I live 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.940
 like a bear I live in the middle of the bears 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.080
 and I try to adapt the least badly 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.350
 possible to human life 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.020
 I'm just not made for we all have a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.910
 instinct like that animal somewhere we 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.190
 does not allow himself to develop it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.230
 then we do not always assume what if you 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.880
 start to walk around like when 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.920
 I was small with a chicken under the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.450
 arm as long as it's a kid it's 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 cute but if today I was going to 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.230
 walk in the street with a hen 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.510
 would stick directly in psychiatry what 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.210
 that it is good to use 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.180
 what nature has lavished upon us and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.300
 then you have to study dig for 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.510
 put forward this difference this gift 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.510
 and who knows how to advance humanity
