alongside<00:00:23.640> paid<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.510> him<00:00:24.630> quite<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> few

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
alongside paid with him quite a few

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
alongside paid with him quite a few
times<00:00:25.670> watched<00:00:26.670> him<00:00:26.849> score<00:00:27.060> goals<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
times watched him score goals for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.580 
times watched him score goals for
england<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.689> world<00:00:27.720> cups<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> wasn't<00:00:28.439> there

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
england in world cups and I wasn't there

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
england in world cups and I wasn't there
so<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.689> he'll<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.840> down<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.430> in<00:00:32.430> our

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
so I think he'll go down in that in our

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.530 
so I think he'll go down in that in our
history<00:00:33.230> as<00:00:34.940> England<00:00:35.940> has<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
history as England has one of the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.479 
history as England has one of the
greatest<00:00:37.050> goal<00:00:37.350> scorers<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:37.980> stripers<00:00:38.250> we've

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
greatest goal scorers and stripers we've

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.780 
greatest goal scorers and stripers we've
had<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.910> he<00:00:39.870> deserves<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.410> high<00:00:40.530> price<00:00:40.800> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
had so he deserves very high price it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.130 
had so he deserves very high price it's
not<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> first<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.629> has<00:00:42.780> happened

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
not the first time this has happened

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.049 
not the first time this has happened
where<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.500> position<00:00:43.980> seems<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> jinx<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
where one position seems to be jinx to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
where one position seems to be jinx to
injury<00:00:45.480> wise<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> build-up<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.620> couple

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
injury wise in the build-up to a couple

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.740 
injury wise in the build-up to a couple
of<00:00:47.160> games<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.940> mean<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> extraordinary

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
of games but I mean it is extraordinary

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 
of games but I mean it is extraordinary
how<00:00:48.989> many<00:00:49.320> central<00:00:49.680> defenders<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.520> had<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
how many central defenders have had to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.740 
how many central defenders have had to
drop<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.079> recent<00:00:52.440> days<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.010> yeah<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
drop out in recent days now yeah it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
drop out in recent days now yeah it
happens<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.260> think<00:00:55.579> these<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> moments

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
happens I think these are the moments

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.720 
happens I think these are the moments
when<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> need<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> strong<00:00:57.690> squad<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.730> somehow

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
when you need a strong squad and somehow

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.520 
when you need a strong squad and somehow
in<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> funny<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> happens<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.350> lose

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
in a funny way it happens with you lose

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
in a funny way it happens with you lose
two<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.770> three<00:01:02.129> or<00:01:02.219> four<00:01:02.250> players<00:01:02.699> from<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
two or three or four players from the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.450 
two or three or four players from the
same<00:01:03.420> position<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.189> that<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.309> test

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
same position and that would test

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
same position and that would test
probably<00:01:05.790> any<00:01:05.880> squad<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> world<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
probably any squad in the world but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 
probably any squad in the world but
we're<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:07.770> fortunate<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.310> we've<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.640> some

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
we're very fortunate that we've got some

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
we're very fortunate that we've got some
very<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.240> young<00:01:09.390> players<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.770> will<00:01:10.920> be

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
very good young players and it will be

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
think then with the quality we haven't

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.229 
think then with the quality we haven't
attained<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:16.430> those<00:02:16.550> attacking<00:02:16.910> players

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
than you'd you'd want to get the right

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.190 
than you'd you'd want to get the right
result<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.209> very<00:02:20.390> much<00:02:20.540> looking<00:02:20.900> at<00:02:21.050> these

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
result is it very much looking at these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.860 
result is it very much looking at these
two<00:02:21.650> games<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.400> possibly<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.180> team<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.630> San

there<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> debate<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.590> says<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.190> smaller

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
there is a debate that says the smaller

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.340 
there is a debate that says the smaller
country<00:02:46.910> should<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.360> prequalify<00:02:47.690> which

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
country should have to prequalify which

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.530 
country should have to prequalify which
would<00:02:48.590> give<00:02:48.799> you<00:02:49.160> guys<00:02:49.370> less<00:02:49.730> qualifiers<00:02:50.299> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
would give you guys less qualifiers to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.449 
would give you guys less qualifiers to
play<00:02:50.750> ultimately<00:02:51.200> where<00:02:51.799> would<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.069> stand<00:02:52.280> on

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
play ultimately where would you stand on

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.470 
play ultimately where would you stand on
that<00:02:52.489> or<00:02:52.700> do<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.850> think<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.150> good<00:02:53.269> thing

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that or do you think it's a good thing

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.699 
that or do you think it's a good thing
that<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.840> smaller<00:02:54.049> countries<00:02:54.470> get<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
that the smaller countries get the

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.080 
that the smaller countries get the
chance<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.130> play<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.549> think<00:02:55.790> we<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
chance to play I think we have to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.340 
chance to play I think we have to
respect<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.510> smaller<00:02:56.750> countries<00:02:57.200> I

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
respect the smaller countries I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.460 
respect the smaller countries I
understand<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.890> debate<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.989> was<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.170> San

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
understand the debate but if I was a San

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.289 
understand the debate but if I was a San
Marino<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.069> know<00:03:01.190> maybe<00:03:01.610> their<00:03:01.790> level<00:03:02.030> there<00:03:02.180> is

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
Marino I know maybe their level there is

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.650 
Marino I know maybe their level there is
not<00:03:02.600> England<00:03:03.440> France<00:03:03.680> fine<00:03:04.130> Brazil<00:03:05.030> thinned

in the world but I think we have to

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.890 
in the world but I think we have to
respect<00:03:07.010> each<00:03:07.280> country<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.720> know<00:03:08.840> the

has huge importance i think december in

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.140 
has huge importance i think december in
a<00:03:24.769> game<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:24.950> course<00:03:25.220> we<00:03:25.370> expected<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.880> win<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
a game of course we expected to win and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.310 
a game of course we expected to win and
we<00:03:26.209> have<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.480> we<00:03:26.510> have<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.840> win<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.230> to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
we have and we have to win we have to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.380 
we have and we have to win we have to
you<00:03:27.769> know<00:03:27.859> be<00:03:28.040> had<00:03:28.190> do<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.850> right<00:03:28.970> job<00:03:29.000> there

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
you know be had do the right job there

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.330 
you know be had do the right job there
so<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.750> think<00:03:29.810> Montenegro<00:03:30.500> being<00:03:30.739> top<00:03:31.160> of<00:03:31.280> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
so I think Montenegro being top of the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.729 
so I think Montenegro being top of the
group<00:03:31.630> that's<00:03:32.630> been<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.930> second<00:03:33.260> place<00:03:33.410> going

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
group that's been in second place going

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.590 
group that's been in second place going
away<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.310> were<00:03:34.549> aware<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.820> how<00:03:35.060> tough<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.420> game

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
away we were aware of how tough a game

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.870 
away we were aware of how tough a game
that<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.810> out<00:03:36.470> there<00:03:36.500> from<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.040> last<00:03:37.459> campaign

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
that is out there from the last campaign

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.840 
that is out there from the last campaign
so<00:03:38.620> when<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.769> have<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.130> as<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> say<00:03:40.609> six

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
so when you have that as you say six

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.000 
so when you have that as you say six
month<00:03:41.060> gap<00:03:41.209> afterwards<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.410> lot<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.769> time

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010

month gap afterwards and a lot of time
you<00:03:43.160> want<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.430> go<00:03:43.519> into<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.910> gap<00:03:44.120> looking

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
you want to go into that gap looking

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.810 
you want to go into that gap looking
comfortable<00:03:44.840> in<00:03:45.079> a<00:03:45.140> table<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.820> imperative

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
comfortable in a table so I imperative

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.150 
comfortable in a table so I imperative
we<00:03:47.000> would<00:03:47.329> do<00:03:47.480> there<00:03:48.079> are<00:03:48.230> most<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.950> them

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
we would do there are most of them

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.430 
we would do there are most of them
together<00:03:49.820> out<00:03:50.090> results<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.510> blood<00:03:50.630> games<00:03:50.900> when

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440

you get to this stage of the season
a<00:03:53.560> relatively<00:03:54.560> short<00:03:54.620> amount<00:03:54.860> premier<00:03:55.340> league

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
it is it quite nice to be away from the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.160 
it is it quite nice to be away from the
pressure<00:04:01.879> of<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.150> league<00:04:02.329> or<00:04:02.569> is<00:04:02.659> it<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.959> sort
