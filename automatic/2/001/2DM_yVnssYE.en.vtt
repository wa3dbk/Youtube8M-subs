what we have done here with our 7/8 inch
natural<00:01:38.730> cotton<00:01:39.330> ribbon<00:01:39.530> now<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> natural

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
natural cotton ribbon now the natural

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.060 
natural cotton ribbon now the natural
fibers<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.910> this<00:01:42.060> ribbon<00:01:42.480> take<00:01:42.990> die<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:43.800> well

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
fibers in this ribbon take die so well

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.890 
fibers in this ribbon take die so well
so<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:44.850> make<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.150> color<00:01:45.540> or

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
so you can really make this color or

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.870 
so you can really make this color or
this<00:01:45.930> ribbon<00:01:46.440> any<00:01:46.620> color<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.040> want<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
this ribbon any color you want and in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.430 
this ribbon any color you want and in
this<00:01:48.000> case<00:01:48.210> we've<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.570> done<00:01:48.870> a<00:01:48.900> two-tone

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
this case we've actually done a two-tone

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.590 
this case we've actually done a two-tone
die<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.010> let<00:01:50.160> me<00:01:50.250> show<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.730> easy<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.330> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
die so let me show you how easy it is to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
die so let me show you how easy it is to
create<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.960> look<00:01:52.410> so<00:01:53.190> start<00:01:53.430> with<00:01:53.520> your

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
cantaloupe and spritz that just to get

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
cantaloupe and spritz that just to get
started<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.130> want<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> really<00:02:02.640> basic

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030

along the middle to create a mask you'll
get<00:02:15.390> another<00:02:15.630> spritzer<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.680> time<00:02:16.890> we

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
get another spritzer and this time we

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.210 
get another spritzer and this time we
have<00:02:17.070> used<00:02:17.750> Calypso<00:02:18.750> coral<00:02:19.100> spritz<00:02:20.100> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
working with is our craft scissors here

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670 
working with is our craft scissors here
because<00:02:35.460> these<00:02:35.670> cut<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.020> well<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.530> never

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
because these cut so well and they never

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.370 
because these cut so well and they never
fray<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> edges<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> create<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.870> bow<00:02:40.020> on

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
fray the edges so to create the bow on

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
fray the edges so to create the bow on
this<00:02:40.650> package<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.190> we've<00:02:41.340> done<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.580> cut<00:02:42.030> this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
this package all we've done is cut this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.140 
this package all we've done is cut this
ribbon<00:02:42.360> into<00:02:42.720> small<00:02:42.960> strips<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.790> using

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
ribbon into small strips and then using

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.740 
ribbon into small strips and then using
some<00:02:45.180> circles<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.750> cardstock<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.570> just

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
some circles of cardstock we have just

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
some circles of cardstock we have just
hot<00:02:48.990> glued<00:02:49.940> little<00:02:50.940> loops<00:02:51.150> around<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.380> edges

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
hot glued little loops around the edges

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.430 
hot glued little loops around the edges
so<00:02:52.800> we'll<00:02:53.040> start<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> big<00:02:53.670> circle<00:02:54.060> and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
so we'll start with a big circle and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
so we'll start with a big circle and
then<00:02:55.440> move<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.070> medium-sized<00:02:56.820> circle

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
then move on to a medium-sized circle

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.100 
then move on to a medium-sized circle
and<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:59.040> smaller<00:02:59.310> sized<00:02:59.610> circle<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.960> can<00:03:01.050> see

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
and a smaller sized circle you can see

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.890 
and a smaller sized circle you can see
how<00:03:01.380> just<00:03:01.410> using<00:03:01.890> those<00:03:02.040> circles<00:03:03.000> put<00:03:03.780> those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
how just using those circles put those

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.080 
how just using those circles put those
together<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:05.100> create<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:05.940> big

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
together you can create this really big

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.590 
together you can create this really big
fancy<00:03:07.080> cool-looking<00:03:07.620> bubble<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.300> seems<00:03:09.480> a
