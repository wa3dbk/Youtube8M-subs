00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.500
 today, I would like to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.040
 Velbert said this was an extraordinary method 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.329
 Introduce the truth 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.329
 What's it all about 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.999
 Remmers beeped German backward language was from the Australian 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.059
 Notes bank notes discovered in the eighties 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.099
 and he found out by chance that they play backwards 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.019
 of songs or language 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.170
 messages that are understandable at certain intervals 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.880
 this so-called backward message 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 then or at BarÃŸels turn up 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 what's up with Reverse Dietz? 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 his years of research have shown 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.830
 that the reverse messages come from the right brain as such 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.550
 so that grotes managed to represent the unconscious mind 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.050
 these backward messages or over the net 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.540
 Comment fact it is over as in demand in the form of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 Fasting too short sentences 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.390
 and with descents 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
 that is in a picture gallery 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.700
 an illustration 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.789
 the government stops 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.510
 I am with the assignment 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.860
 the GGM half Lukesch rational Rete 4 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 the world stars forward spoken Cadillac 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.720
 right side 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.600
 holistic emotional Heike 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.720
 the SAS paid off the backward messages brother van 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 Persia 1 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.780
 a practical example parents with 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.910
 she can imagine that better 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.380
 if, for example, a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.800
 the person who interviews 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.410
 St 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
 so now again to change 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 is now such a thing where I think that's worth it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249
 when it comes to changing jobs 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.930
 and on the contrary in several parentheses 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.930
 Voigt thinks that's worth it 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.119
 Dive exactly this praise Wulff and scratched have played 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.139
 Wulff or Wolf 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.279
 it was really an English country house in this case 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.789
 stands for the main drive of behavior and self-motivation 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.649
 and that would mean in this context 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.940
 the consideration 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.459
 where I do not think seriously 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.480
 Percent holds 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.379
 commented on by the unconscious 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.110
 there is no drive 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.099
 available 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.540
 So it would not be this person to places the Steinacher you get 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.869
 indeed 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:55.869
 perform 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.089
 here one 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.089
 for Germany prepares in a sauna file 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.290
 that splits up like that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.290
 a longer part of the club talked 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.349
 that calls for those in which the Reversal appears 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.439
 the actual race messed up 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.099
 emphasis 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.530
 slows down and slows down again as well as a total of three speeds 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.389
 and the reversal in a salute and begged so-called skyline 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.389
 gibberish 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.909
 yes, what is Broder's Dietzsch suitable for him as the possible uses 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.969
 It is capable of questioning important decisions in private and 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.099
 business I was there 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.159
 this is the interview with or used 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.609
 also came Mainz 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.079
 to be used for personality development 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.429
 to edit the life issues jogging finances health relationship 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.139
 and blockers must be heard heap cover and dissolve 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.889
 if you are interested in the rhine-main baskets 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.879
 ask Kerner 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.299
 my current dates for lectures and workshops 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.719
 They opt for others other than Peanuts 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.889
 or 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.789
 I can sit face to face with News Latvian - work in a row
