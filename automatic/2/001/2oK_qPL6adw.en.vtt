00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.460
 hey small welcome to 1 episode 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.920
 of the adventures of having him I am 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.779
 John or at least they say that to me for 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.750
 who are complaining on youtube 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.490
 we did not have with the stealth the long 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.980
 boxing of the collector's edition of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.320
 my standards and we were going to start 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.370
 checking the game a little bit the game 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.290
 it came out on the 25th and it was released we continue on 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.810
 chile why we say have the signatures 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.190
 17 collector of 12 the 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.720
 game developers and a 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.270
 representative of argentina also of 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.489
 pixar for latin america there you can see 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.829
 a little bit the details of the box and the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.379
 box is very heavy to tell them the 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.850
 it's really a lot of effort to try 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.859
 to open it with a bad area so I 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.710
 they will watch during the whole video trying 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.239
 speaking they try to open the box to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.730
 to be able to see the contents but not 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.580
 worry let's go through that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.020
 okay quick then to start watching 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.000
 the contents of the box we are going to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
 open it a little bit with my clumsy hands 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.140
 or hand because for some reason it's super 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 difficult to open a box where are the hand 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.110
 while one is recording a video 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.810
 and inside we will find immediately 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 an art book that belongs let's say to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 all the art set to be good 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 the whole set but if a good part 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.940
 of all art concepts and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.240
 decision to expand the book of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.780
 art has approximately 200 pages 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.840
 If I'm not mistaken, it's 208 pages and it's 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.270
 a book let's say loin, let's say loin 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.909
 hard that has a very hard cap 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.229
 out there not only contains concepts 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.700
 of art but it also contains 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.060
 some of the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.759
 let's say to some renders of those of the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.619
 3d models that were used for the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.270
 kinematics and also has some other 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.710
 things some other concepts that do not 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 they came to use 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.500
 there are some very interesting ones 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.630
 guys that look like humanoid tigers that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.880
 it's definitely worth it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.940
 let's say review of course no no no 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.530
 let's see here probably but 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.940
 if there are some concerts that do not 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.200
 they came to use in the game and they 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.910
 see as quite cool and that 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
 possibly we could even get to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.200
 see somewhere so there they have of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.720
 all forms the collection is pretty 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.730
 pretty 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.730
 let's say the people who are interested in 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.140
 the design let's say in the illustration 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.240
 all these concepts are super 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 interesting to perform we can see 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.140
 also some of the concepts that are 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.940
 they made for cher 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 some of the references also that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.470
 were used let's say for the subject of 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.510
 the objects of the forests to walk in 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.580
 the forests in general as I said and 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.610
 in the chet images so the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.390
 dramas the art book and even the is 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.069
 this is the best part 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.440
 the art book as I said it was 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.990
 hard and it also has some reliefs 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.819
 ahead unfortunately still there 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.440
 has after that we have a mouse pad 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.690
 which is very similar and quality of each 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.819
 guy could you say it's a little bit of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.190
 lower quality is a mouse pad with chip 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.230
 staudt storms in the in the part of 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.330
 forward I have it now let's say hands 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.960
 to continue not now 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.420
 the next element of unboxing is the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.900
 soundtrack of the game and this soundtrack 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.540
 team to approximately 20 clues if not 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.310
 I'm wrong if you have 20 lists 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.190
 we found some great successes like 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.950
 the wonder and the wave of bank server 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.320
 writers going fawcett and many others more 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.520
 of course there is the music of the 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.920
 kinematics that we 're listening to 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.400
 background and also the intro of the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.400
 game 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.240
 next comes the wear the scenes 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.400
 of floor would scare this has just as 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.090
 in the devil collector's edition 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.380
 3 comes a dvd and comes a blu-ray disc 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.720
 for those who want to see the 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.970
 high definition cinematic we saw it 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.400
 that in the house closely in the blu-ray and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.080
 it looks great so if you have 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.970
 blu ray if you have a play 3 for 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.730
 example or anything what you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.560
 can play blu ray see it if it's 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.970
 who have the chance see it also by 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.280
 course they contain the credits for 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.440
 all the people who participated in 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.570
 the development of the cinematic of misses 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.250
 pantaria and also includes several 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.590
 interviews with developers and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.330
 It also includes some of the concepts 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.820
 that they did not use the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.150
 storyboards the studies of colors 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.800
 etc 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.229
 and of course also continues with the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.150
 trailers of the patches and of course 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.700
 the game 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.740
 let's open this wonder a little bit 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.689
 of the game basically diego in the box 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.389
 that comes inside d 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.459
 of the collector's edition brings a 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.790
 quick start guide whose code I'm not going 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:48.010
 to show 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.200
 because those surprises later 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.030
 excellence November there I will speak a 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.350
 little bit more than that 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.570
 and also look of course the fire 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.060
 padaria viewer and those are all 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.350
 physical contents that I have done less 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.610
 of all the physical contents that 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.070
 you are now seeing in general 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.140
 here only the card game that 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.510
 let's say this opportunity is not included 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.230
 It would have been great to include a day or they are 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.700
 a pack of monk but of the end without 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.860
 However, this is not the only thing that comes 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.910
 let's say in the miso collector 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.010
 panda that we can also 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.360
 find some digital content 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.890
 that are not only in the edition of 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.680
 collector but they are also in 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.930
 the starting digital edition we have the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.730
 mount imperial killer is' to 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.950
 good warcraft is a ground mount 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.350
 and also a flying mount 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.670
 let's say if it is shared with all 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.800
 the characters in the account 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.470
 down you can see the puppy 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.290
 rent of luck that is basically 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.250
 a gentle pet day of milk to the 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.660
 right you can see the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.960
 rewards also for starcraft that 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.129
 are let's say two portraits one of horco and 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.110
 one of the background was to temper 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.959
 and below you can also see the reward 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.239
 for devil 3 that are some designs and 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.399
 new reasons for the banner that 

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.509
 you raise with the footage that has 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.069
 been today's episode guys 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.409

 issuing videos pandaria so see you 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.349
