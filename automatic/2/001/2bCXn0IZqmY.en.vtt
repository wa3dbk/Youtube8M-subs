 very good my friends today we are going to 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.520
 prepare a chicha of rice with pineapple 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.189
 chicha many ways to prepare the 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.810
 chicha in many parts of Colombia in 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.420
 many parts of the world prepares a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.210
 chair this is a way we met 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.910
 in the cesar because when they stop preparing it 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.970
 in this good way now people to 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.820
 Cesar clubs that is not the chicha with 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.380
 rice and pineapple that we prepare and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.520
 we will teach to you a drink 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.540
 very very rich welcome 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.900
 good friends for 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.030
 the chicha of rice with pineapple 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.460
 need two liters of water can be 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.550
 a little more little less we're going 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.420
 seeing as how we will being thick 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 obviously the pineapple to take out its shell 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.190
 we have nails of honor 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.369
 I here I have about 10-12 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.820
 cloves to give a rich flavor to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.820
 sausage 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.759
 cinnamon pills 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 that also helps a very flavor 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.390
 nice 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.909
 can use with panela I already have it 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.819
 here 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.530
 is not grated or scraped panela opened the 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.120
 I have here in pieces well 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.120
 little ones 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.450
 half a cup of rice that equals more or 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.450
 less 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.979
 90 grams plus or minus fees come 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.760
 to measure quantities also in the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.930
 kitchen but sometimes people ask 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.930
 how many grams are 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.050
 then we take the pineapple 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.150
 let's remove the part 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.660
 from the one below that is usually this 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.360
 with some society where the shell of 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.870
 the pineapple is damaged easier and we discard 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.870
 that part 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.370
 very carefully 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.250
 to peel the pineapple we are going to remove the peel 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.670
 which is what we really need to 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.890
 the preparation of chicha 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.459
 and the fruit then we are going to save for 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 juice to eat and together as fruit 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.750
 which is very rich too 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.630
 pineapple peel all we get all 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.630
 houses 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 we put the liter and 9 of water in a pot 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.990
 in a bowl we wait for the fire 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.760
 and in this water we put 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.590
 to cook to boil 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.590
 the pineapple peels 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 and here we add the half cup of rice 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.830
 only 90 grams of rice more or less 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 let's wait for this and he's going to 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.410
 rice bursts to rice is already 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.340
 soft that can be eaten like this is 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.090
 simple simply and then we withdraw 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.230
 in this moment of the fire our pot and 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.650
 let's cool 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.120
 and we have not put the nails and the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.599
 cinnamon to get its aroma 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.640
 and we add this water once it boiled 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.140
 quite our nails with our 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.260
 cinnamon 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.380
 to our rice and shell mix 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.380
 pineapple 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:49.290
 Now what you have to do is liquefy 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.909
 all this both the pineapple peels 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.909
 with water and rice 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.920
 and were this perfectly 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.200
 do not be afraid that we will be left 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.310
 a lot of garbage from the pineapple that at the end 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.319
 Well, we're going to school 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.319
 let's liquefy well well liquefied 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.780
 once liquefied we add the panela yo 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.640
 I add panela but you can use it 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.100
 also with sugar is not necessarily 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.100
 with panela with sugar and honey 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:36.140
 this molasses from the cane any 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.930
 sweetener is very well we add 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:44.100
 we liquefy so that the sugar or the sweet 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.590
 integrates well and we will strain 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.070
 to remove all the impurities from the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.070
 shell 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.610
 and make a little extra because 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.610
 it always remains 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.080
 enough or maybe this liquefied 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.800
 and so we go now 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.300
 extracting our chicha 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.819
 we are going to liquefy the rest of the rice that 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.680
 we have been left in the pot because here 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.360
 We made two co-ordinated batches that 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.979
 there was totally but rice was not 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.230
 it matters because then we're going to mix everything 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.550
 again 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.449
 the rice we are going to also liquefy it 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.400
 completely well liquefied 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.270
 fear let's let that liquefy 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.880
 a lot of time 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.640
 as you will see already here in the corridor of 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.340
 this part of the paddy rice is not 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.180
 much the waste that remains that this 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.180
 practically the rice was totally 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.180
 smoothie 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.080
 and this we are going to add to the 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.639
 preparation that we liquefied previously 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.550
 we are integrating everything 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:06:00.259
 and look at the creamy consistency like 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.279
 we have this girl 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.300
 Now let's add to the blender 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.300
 some ice cubes 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.750
 we add our chicha 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.029
 and we're going to liquefy a lot too 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:30.330
 have this delicious cold drink 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:34.319
 ready to serve and to consume 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.610
 It is a very rich drink very typical of 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.379
 these countries over all countries 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:43.439
 Andean rice chicha with pink 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:48.110
 prepare and enjoy good as you saw 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:51.230
 my friends is easy and it is very very rich 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.160
 there are regions and parts where he leaves 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:58.250
 ferment 34 days and it becomes a little 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.610
 let's say alcoholic by the ferment that 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.830
 it acquires thus the 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.409
 guarapo for example with pure peel 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.319
 pineapple 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:11.439
 so I invite you to enjoy 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:13.599
 This chicha of rice with pineapple is very 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:16.019
 very rich and thank you very much see you in 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.019
 the next
