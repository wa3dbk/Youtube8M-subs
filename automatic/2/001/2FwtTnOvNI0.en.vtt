so pretty good I guess yeah this class
is<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.760> work<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.670> course<00:00:24.330> director

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.589 

actually<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.019> course<00:00:28.320> director<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:30.330> course

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
actually the course director the course

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
actually the course director the course
director<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.590> assistant<00:00:32.070> course<00:00:32.279> director

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

director the assistant course director
and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> few<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.040> lab<00:00:35.250> people<00:00:35.610> um

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
and I think a few of the lab people um

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.150 
and I think a few of the lab people um
are<00:00:37.700> all<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:39.270> Disney<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.620> point<00:00:40.980> not

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really sure what studio house but they

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.040 
really sure what studio house but they
are<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.230> Disney<00:00:43.700> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.510> old<00:00:45.660> 2d

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
are from Disney a lot of them are old 2d

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.040 
are from Disney a lot of them are old 2d
artists<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> experience<00:00:48.660> as

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
artists they have a lot of experience as

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
artists they have a lot of experience as
far<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.590> 2d<00:00:50.370> animation<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> concerned<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
far as 2d animation is concerned and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
far as 2d animation is concerned and
pretty<00:00:52.890> much<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> same<00:00:53.280> principles<00:00:53.820> apply<00:00:53.910> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
pretty much the same principles apply in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.799 
pretty much the same principles apply in
3d<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.039> they're<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.070> knowledgeable<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.059> what

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
3d so they're very knowledgeable on what

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.770 
3d so they're very knowledgeable on what
they're<00:00:57.960> teaching<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.180> good<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> learn

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they're teaching so it's good to learn

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
they're teaching so it's good to learn
from<00:01:01.170> somebody<00:01:01.609> who<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:02.789> knows<00:01:03.090> what

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
from somebody who really knows what

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
from somebody who really knows what
they're<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.840> far<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.140> animation<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
they're doing as far as animation is

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.880

my third project already yeah we did a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680 
my third project already yeah we did a
typical<00:02:23.890> ball<00:02:24.040> bounce<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.360> your<00:02:25.480> most

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
typical ball bounce which is your most

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.350 
typical ball bounce which is your most
basic<00:02:26.110> animation<00:02:26.819> Squire<00:02:27.819> squash<00:02:28.150> and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360

stretch and anticipation all that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.809 
stretch and anticipation all that
stuff's<00:02:30.370> concerned<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:32.500> also<00:02:32.650> did<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.340> juice

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
stuff's concerned we also did a juice

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.330 
stuff's concerned we also did a juice
box<00:02:34.090> inanimate<00:02:34.569> object<00:02:35.170> we're<00:02:35.650> basically<00:02:36.099> we

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
box inanimate object we're basically we

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.229 
box inanimate object we're basically we
have<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:37.950> animate<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.220> juice<00:02:39.400> box<00:02:39.640> making

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
have to animate the juice box making

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.860 
have to animate the juice box making
that<00:02:40.360> juice<00:02:40.510> box<00:02:40.540> walk<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.380> very<00:02:41.800> hard<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:43.690> rig

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that juice box walk is very hard the rig

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.089 
that juice box walk is very hard the rig
on<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.080> juice<00:02:44.349> box<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.769> not<00:02:44.890> very

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
on the juice box is not very

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.270 
on the juice box is not very
user-friendly<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.170> unfortunately<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
user-friendly so unfortunately it's the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.789 
user-friendly so unfortunately it's the
most<00:02:48.730> tedious<00:02:49.060> thing<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:50.440> going<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.680> upload

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
most tedious thing I'm going to upload

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.360 
most tedious thing I'm going to upload

my animations once I'm done yeah so you
guys<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.700> see<00:02:54.880> those<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.269> later<00:02:55.450> video<00:02:55.620> we

did we're doing a basic walk in it right
now<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.989> project<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.410> we're<00:02:59.560> working<00:02:59.799> on

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
now the project that we're working on

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.740 
now the project that we're working on
basic<00:03:00.069> walk<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.970> basically<00:03:01.269> getting<00:03:01.540> down

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
basic walk just basically getting down

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
basic walk just basically getting down
to<00:03:01.780> mechanics<00:03:02.349> of<00:03:02.610> going<00:03:03.610> from<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:03.940> position

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
to mechanics of going from one position

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.320 
to mechanics of going from one position
to<00:03:04.450> another<00:03:05.340> both<00:03:06.340> sitting<00:03:06.760> poses<00:03:07.150> but

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
to another both sitting poses but

I'll<00:06:54.040> be<00:06:54.190> honest<00:06:54.490> it's<00:06:54.820> been<00:06:54.940> happening<00:06:55.120> for

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
I'll be honest it's been happening for

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.030 
I'll be honest it's been happening for
months<00:06:55.720> and<00:06:55.870> everybody<00:06:56.200> talks<00:06:56.440> about<00:06:56.590> it<00:06:56.860> and

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
months and everybody talks about it and

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.910 
months and everybody talks about it and
nothing's<00:06:57.670> been<00:06:57.850> done<00:06:57.970> so<00:06:58.900> that's<00:06:59.560> why<00:06:59.710> we'll

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
nothing's been done so that's why we'll

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.160 
nothing's been done so that's why we'll
say<00:07:00.070> about<00:07:00.250> that<00:07:00.430> but<00:07:01.360> yet<00:07:01.540> fundamentals<00:07:02.170> of

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
say about that but yet fundamentals of

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.600 
say about that but yet fundamentals of
animation<00:07:02.620> was<00:07:02.710> really<00:07:02.950> cool<00:07:03.100> and<00:07:03.400> this

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
animation was really cool and this

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.220 
animation was really cool and this
basically<00:07:03.820> built<00:07:04.240> on<00:07:04.420> top<00:07:04.600> of<00:07:04.660> that<00:07:04.900> so<00:07:05.110> you're

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
basically built on top of that so you're

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.480 
basically built on top of that so you're
taking<00:07:05.350> the<00:07:05.590> 12<00:07:05.830> principles<00:07:05.980> of<00:07:06.370> animation

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
taking the 12 principles of animation

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.000 
taking the 12 principles of animation
and<00:07:07.180> you're<00:07:07.600> basically<00:07:07.990> applying<00:07:08.380> it<00:07:08.590> to<00:07:08.620> more

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
and you're basically applying it to more

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.440 
and you're basically applying it to more
projects<00:07:09.430> but<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.670> projects<00:07:10.000> a<00:07:10.090> little<00:07:10.360> bit

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450 
projects but the projects a little bit

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.960 
projects but the projects a little bit
more<00:07:10.570> intense<00:07:10.900> you're<00:07:11.170> not<00:07:11.290> working<00:07:11.680> with<00:07:11.970> you

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
more intense you're not working with you

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.910 
more intense you're not working with you
know<00:07:13.030> a<00:07:13.060> robot<00:07:13.510> you<00:07:13.960> know<00:07:14.050> orbit<00:07:14.530> you<00:07:14.860> know

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920 
know a robot you know orbit you know

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.410 
know a robot you know orbit you know
they<00:07:15.070> can<00:07:15.220> roll<00:07:15.370> around<00:07:15.400> and<00:07:15.850> quadruped<00:07:16.270> it

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420 
they can roll around and quadruped it

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.420 
they can roll around and quadruped it
like<00:07:16.710> you're<00:07:17.710> working<00:07:17.830> with<00:07:18.040> biped

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
like you're working with biped

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.190 
like you're working with biped
characters<00:07:18.850> you're<00:07:19.030> doing<00:07:19.210> walks<00:07:19.480> inanimate

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
objects you're doing some pretty

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.980 
objects you're doing some pretty
difficult<00:07:23.110> things<00:07:23.590> so<00:07:24.390> it's<00:07:25.390> challenging<00:07:25.840> I

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
difficult things so it's challenging I

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.650 
difficult things so it's challenging I
like<00:07:26.650> the<00:07:26.770> challenge<00:07:27.300> not<00:07:28.300> really<00:07:28.510> digging

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660 
like the challenge not really digging

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.530 
like the challenge not really digging

me and now i think i'm going to do a

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.000 
me and now i think i'm going to do a
little<00:07:34.330> bit<00:07:34.660> more<00:07:34.870> of<00:07:35.020> these<00:07:35.140> smaller<00:07:35.530> videos

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
little bit more of these smaller videos

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.700 
little bit more of these smaller videos
and<00:07:36.870> and<00:07:37.870> go<00:07:38.020> buy<00:07:38.170> a<00:07:38.200> little<00:07:38.350> quicker<00:07:38.590> now

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
and and go buy a little quicker now

and and go buy a little quicker now
grant<00:07:39.160> it<00:07:39.280> it's<00:07:40.210> a<00:07:40.360> little<00:07:40.540> longer<00:07:40.720> than<00:07:40.960> I<00:07:41.080> had

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740 
grant it it's a little longer than I had

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.370 
grant it it's a little longer than I had
anticipated<00:07:41.860> but<00:07:42.460> you<00:07:42.880> know<00:07:43.030> there<00:07:43.840> I<00:07:44.080> guess

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380 
anticipated but you know there I guess

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.830 
anticipated but you know there I guess
they<00:07:44.500> won't<00:07:44.650> always<00:07:44.800> be<00:07:44.950> like<00:07:45.100> this<00:07:45.250> but

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840
