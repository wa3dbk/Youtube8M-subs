00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.370
 Hi, I'm a turquoise cat and with the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.840
 news of a turner and good first 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.360
 at 3.10 it would be so good if you're 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.540
 A lazy person 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:29.220
 to appearance from behind to clouding this 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.190
 good have added this what will be the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.380
 cloud and what you have said are the lenses 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.970
 of aviator for alcohol maybe in the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.400
 future as an aggregate to all this 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.220
 bar that adds in a lot of things 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.640
 new 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.600
 that's the most important part of that version 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.880
 let's go with what will be the next 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.270
 well, the minor has been improved 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.650
 here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.120
 also this saying things 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.829
 to play but you'll see that really 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.469
 after waking up a little 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.230
 and well I have to upload more a turner not 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.300
 I understand if I know 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.460
 and well this bike is not new mod 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.550
 logoria and attracts not the video of the mods 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 and then I'll upload it and the new thing is this 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.870
 we now have the options of the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.210
 graphics from here that the truth this 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.590
 close enough oxygen I explain them by 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.719
 what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 now we can be looking towards the 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.649
 plants but I want to modify that see 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.120
 how you see the water we put here 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.240
 graphics we put water 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.080
 and we can go see the change does not look at 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.520
 medium 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.520
 without medium is not the big deal 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 yes 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.000
 then we can also see what they would be 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.010
 the graphics plants 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.049
 something bad only once and we put it in the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.049
 logo appear less plants 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.049
 we expose 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.460
 the plants move 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.190
 so good now 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.929
 will be the news of a turner so 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.240

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.690
