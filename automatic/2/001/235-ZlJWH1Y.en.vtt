together<00:01:04.129> sometimes<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.220> wish<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
together sometimes I wish it was a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450 
together sometimes I wish it was a
little<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:06.090> shorter<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.840> maybe<00:01:07.770> it'd<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
little bit shorter so maybe it'd be a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
little bit shorter so maybe it'd be a
little<00:01:08.670> bit<00:01:08.880> easier<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> remember<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.020> we

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
little bit easier to remember but we

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
little bit easier to remember but we
know<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> remember<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.189> yeah<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.390> obviously

and i don't believe in the beauty is
pain<00:03:12.300> because<00:03:13.300> her<00:03:13.510> pain<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.870> beauty<00:03:14.250> whatever

damage<00:03:30.280> them<00:03:30.670> like<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.750> might<00:03:31.900> not<00:03:32.019> realize

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
damage them like you might not realize

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.710 
damage them like you might not realize
but<00:03:32.380> over<00:03:32.739> time<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.790> veins<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.239> your<00:03:34.330> legs<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
but over time the veins in your legs to

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.230 
but over time the veins in your legs to
start<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> pop<00:03:35.110> out<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.500> if<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.739> wear

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
start to pop out and if you wear

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.650 
start to pop out and if you wear
all<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.540> time<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.020> um<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:38.220> try<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.120> wear<00:03:39.300> heels

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
all the time so um I try and wear heels

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.210 
all the time so um I try and wear heels
of<00:03:39.870> different<00:03:40.140> height<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.530> different<00:03:41.070> days

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
of different height on different days

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.390 
of different height on different days
because<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:42.690> burying<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.590> helps<00:03:44.280> your

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
because just burying it helps your

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.490 
because just burying it helps your
hamstrings<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.210> not<00:03:45.510> get<00:03:45.720> stuck<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.110> one

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
hamstrings to not get stuck in one

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.430 
hamstrings to not get stuck in one
position<00:03:46.620> exactly<00:03:47.280> exactly<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.240> i<00:03:48.600> will<00:03:49.260> wear

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
position exactly exactly so i will wear

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.050 
position exactly exactly so i will wear
heels<00:03:49.710> but<00:03:49.890> i'll<00:03:50.010> wear<00:03:50.190> heels<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.790> different

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
heels but i'll wear heels of different

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.480 
heels but i'll wear heels of different
heights<00:03:51.210> i'll<00:03:51.450> throw<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.750> flats<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.560> i'll<00:03:53.310> try

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
heights i'll throw in flats and i'll try

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.280 
heights i'll throw in flats and i'll try
not<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.970> wear<00:03:54.090> heels<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.570> days<00:03:54.750> right<00:03:55.020> now<00:03:55.050> i'll

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
not to wear heels on days right now i'll

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.750 
not to wear heels on days right now i'll
be<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.530> my<00:03:55.560> feet<00:03:55.770> all<00:03:55.980> day<00:03:56.070> for<00:03:56.460> obvious

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
be on my feet all day for obvious

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.660 
be on my feet all day for obvious
reasons<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:58.110> know<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.530> sometimes<00:03:59.280> I

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
reasons then you know and sometimes I

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.360 
reasons then you know and sometimes I
pack<00:04:00.120> an<00:04:00.270> extra<00:04:00.360> pair<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.750> shoes<00:04:00.960> in<00:04:01.170> case

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
pack an extra pair of shoes in case

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.710 
pack an extra pair of shoes in case
especially<00:04:02.370> one<00:04:02.460> breaking<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.880> new<00:04:04.430> heels<00:04:05.720> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
especially one breaking in new heels and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.350 
especially one breaking in new heels and
another<00:04:07.320> thing<00:04:07.740> that<00:04:08.310> really<00:04:08.460> helps<00:04:08.760> heels<00:04:09.060> is

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
another thing that really helps heels is

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.360 
another thing that really helps heels is
paying<00:04:09.750> attention<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.410> arch<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> shoe

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
paying attention to the arch of the shoe

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.930 
paying attention to the arch of the shoe
and<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.900> became<00:04:13.050> more<00:04:13.380> aware<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.850> over<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
and so I became more aware this over the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.940 
and so I became more aware this over the
past<00:04:15.120> few<00:04:15.300> months<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:16.380> are<00:04:16.470> some<00:04:16.650> shoes

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
past few months there are some shoes

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.820 
past few months there are some shoes
that<00:04:17.340> even<00:04:18.180> if<00:04:18.299> they're<00:04:18.450> really<00:04:18.780> high<00:04:19.260> if<00:04:19.650> they

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
that even if they're really high if they

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.949 
that even if they're really high if they
have<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> stacked<00:04:20.489> platform<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.390> if<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:21.750> fit

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
have a stacked platform and if they fit

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.200 
have a stacked platform and if they fit
your<00:04:22.110> arch<00:04:22.290> perfectly<00:04:22.890> they<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.580> be<00:04:23.850> way<00:04:24.180> more

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
your arch perfectly they can be way more

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.450 
your arch perfectly they can be way more
comfortable<00:04:24.570> than<00:04:24.870> last<00:04:25.080> definitely<00:04:26.070> i<00:04:26.100> have

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
comfortable than last definitely i have

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.880 
comfortable than last definitely i have
a<00:04:26.490> bunch<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> flaccid<00:04:27.480> actually<00:04:28.170> cut<00:04:28.530> into<00:04:28.800> my

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
a bunch of flaccid actually cut into my

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.640 
a bunch of flaccid actually cut into my
ankles<00:04:29.340> because<00:04:29.660> they're<00:04:30.660> such<00:04:31.380> thick

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
ankles because they're such thick

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.920 
ankles because they're such thick
leather<00:04:31.920> or<00:04:32.310> buckles<00:04:32.970> but<00:04:33.240> i<00:04:33.450> feel<00:04:33.900> that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
leather or buckles but i feel that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.450 
leather or buckles but i feel that
aren't<00:04:34.350> likely<00:04:34.500> more<00:04:34.830> comfortable<00:04:35.280> than

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
aren't likely more comfortable than

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.490 
aren't likely more comfortable than
those<00:04:35.730> not<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.870> really<00:04:37.050> depends<00:04:37.350> on<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
those not so it really depends on the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.560 
those not so it really depends on the
shoe<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:38.340> would<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.910> right<00:04:39.060> shoe<00:04:39.360> pads

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
shoe it would like the right shoe pads

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.480 
shoe it would like the right shoe pads
anything<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:40.590> made<00:04:40.620> comfortable<00:04:40.980> yeah

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
anything can be made comfortable yeah

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.640 
anything can be made comfortable yeah
and<00:04:41.670> then<00:04:41.850> as<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.630> start<00:04:42.690> shopping<00:04:43.230> and

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and then as you start shopping and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.130 
and then as you start shopping and
trying<00:04:44.220> out<00:04:44.430> new<00:04:44.460> shoes<00:04:44.880> you'll<00:04:45.240> learn<00:04:45.780> what

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
trying out new shoes you'll learn what

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.890 
trying out new shoes you'll learn what
works<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.590> what<00:04:46.770> doesn't<00:04:46.950> and<00:04:47.900> so
