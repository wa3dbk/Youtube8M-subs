00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.910
 hey people crime ixia and today i have 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.769
 unfortunately something worse news 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 from the state and that is about a fake 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 dale see on me personally 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 also extremely pleased 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.720
 maybe by the name says dlc 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.859
 something this dlc has yesterday on the internet 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.330
 the round made quite a few 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 American youtubers have to this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.840
 dlc a video made and have too 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 pretty much tasted mine 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 rockstar games supposedly this dlc 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 that has not been announced unfortunately 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.140
 this is unfortunately one 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.700
 fake I 'll just go now 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 einschinden a screenshot of the page 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.969
 and as you can see that draws 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.530
 really technically real looks like so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.270
 really original as if this were 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 page created by rockstar games 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 but unfortunately not so with this one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.239
 page is a page of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.309
 a fake and means us unfortunately 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.480
 no doubt you might expect 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 very briefly to all who do not know 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.059
 I am sorry for what it is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 I forgot to explain if 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.510
 he, for example, considers this is something 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 meant like a police dlc in german 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.390
 So it's getting pretty 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 much speculation that one may 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 can buy police vehicles and so on 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.719
 on and on 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.450
 That's why I have myself personally 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.740
 already extremely looking forward to it and am 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.000
 unfortunately also disappointed so far 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.260
 because it came out that it is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.939
 this is a fake maybe 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 is it so that now something 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.820
 disappointed if you already 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.320
 have heard of the dlc there like 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 already said some youtuber about this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.790
 have made video but well what 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 you want to do it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.159
 I 'd rather inform you about the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 bad news not at all 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.340
 that you are still happy then unfortunately 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.869
 not like that and it will never appear 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 are really extremely horny but me 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.750
 I thought somehow that is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 So what rockstar games is about 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.009
 rockstar games somehow too uncool for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.090
 and dlc that one is actually 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.740
 can buy police cars write me 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.850
 times to your opinion in the comments 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 is me definitely right to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.670
 Interested in what you mean 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 at least to the point of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 to come back to the video it will unfortunately 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.920
 no police dlc appear 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 unfortunately it was just a fake and what else 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
 to this fake side and that one has 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.240
 found out that this site is from 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.009
 the same pattern was created 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.689
 synonymous ever created a halo fakes 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.219
 This fake is called there has already been 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.750
 imagine the complete halo community 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.250
 that same has already been with halo 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.840
 he said that just healthy 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.579
 funny sales comes out i know 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 maybe not you know as more but 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.190
 I do not ask myself with mister yet 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.780
 In any case, the law was right 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 again with gta made no 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.569
 I'm not sure what's wrong with the type 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.170
 somehow the whole gamer fooled 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.420
 want 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.440
 In any case, the glc is unfortunately 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.610
 not appear as said today 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.989
 scare as your opinion in the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.550
 comments even if it's a bad one 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.349
 Of course I had a message if you can 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.849
 I liked that dennis is then 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.780
