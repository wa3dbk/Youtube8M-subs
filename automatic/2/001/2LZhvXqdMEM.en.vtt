00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.740
 then we start directly to 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.740

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.829

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.809
 Mostly at grin for you have the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.450
 Most still written on caution 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.820
 glass that does not look good on it 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.559

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.280
 not really a bank 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.290
 are not because then we have first 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.479
 monster imports I think that's right 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 we have been out of here in the background 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.880
 probably phoenix sees you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 So the m then it's like, for 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.270
 Coat of arms is called that because they are 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.659
 make turn-lock to buy 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:48.299
 next we have monster energy 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.600
 x-raid anti gravity the lausers cool 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.490

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.490

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.870
 next monster was mega me 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.890
 do not know right now I believe 750 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.509
 milliliters would have to be that yes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.270
 it just keeps bigger than normal i can 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 Also I can not exactly a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.050
 I can miss a few thousand 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.440
 make and will now be the size of her 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.110

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 as even the monster sign that faith 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.150
 I just see a sticker too 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.400

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.100
 Food fan of the American tidal wave 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.290
 sticker will relocate everything because of me 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.450
 again, I watch the war from the beginning 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:49.350
 live the rest but right next 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:58.130

00:02:49.350 --> 00:03:05.150

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:07.440

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.880

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.750
 Drink yes the guy up here is in 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.570
 Green also wants to be cool next 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.120
 then we have the monster import here 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.760
 again I will also use the one 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.049
 We will join the other channel together 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.260
 review the channel is as I said in the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.510
 description thin 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 Now we still have these monsters 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:44.610
 low carb energy he is cool from 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 it contains a blue tab 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.630
 probably back here but 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.690
 I appreciate that with something 549 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.680
 milliliters as it is usually one 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.840
 monster from America and then I look 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:08.130
 just 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.130
 to put that down 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.779
 has that good that is now the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.779
 About Monster in a gas bottle 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:00.729
 finally done it is now 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:06.330
 bit up here so the over 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:09.339
 monster this cool out of energy 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.430
 is up here how can you 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:15.539
 just not reading 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:20.469
 so now the camera shaaf energy 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.900
 bioactive noble colleague yes about monster 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.060
 here on the top of the bottle is the 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.949
 enormous 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.020
 I think that's not good then 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.759
 twice as big but quite a bit 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:38.830
 bigger is normal yes the monster ms there 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:41.289
 in the back again looks like this from youth 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.520
 you can see it in the bottle too 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.520
 such a law 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.500
 you can see here I do not know now 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.060
 again how to do that does not mention the 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.879
 Really just realize what it is 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.469
 should be synonymous energy third that 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:03.729
 monster energy is in there but otherwise 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:05.949
 were the first now all loose find 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.349
 I am very happy with these in themselves 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.729
 now no one looks at the first 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.189
 real dents or none 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:17.919
 conspicuous yes that here are the 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:20.520
 That's it, that's all 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.990
