00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.750
 let 's one now make one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 video showing a tutorial the first 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.740
 It will be in the sex 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 This is a game that thousands of people 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.930
 play is easy 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.970
 the first thoreau will be a simple 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 so sure of the brand here then I will 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.439
 leave the description rui pedro sergio 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.380
 aquino in the channel in the inscription 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 I'll teach you guys the key in the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.180
 margin already has the right field banner you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.920
 You do not need to download crap, it's just 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 you shake hands with whoever you choose has 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 that saving money is clear how to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.070
 that in the corner of the screen the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.500
 money some 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 so come on it 's a pretty simple thing 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.789
 I'll leave them to the chance I will not 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.620
 use any type of command only when 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.260
 I'm out of bath and ramp that I leave here. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.600
 a setting that I leave 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 when I have samba and rap I put pa 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 popular in the tank to tank is this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 ball that sits in the middle of the tunnel mouse 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.510
 between the right and left sides there are those 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.130
 do not know but just use she cut week and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 ramp already has a good notion 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 now it's a lot easier with this one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 a much more race thing 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.080
 first let's take care ww is horrible 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 But I learned when I started with 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.090
 near water 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.350
 just press the jump 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 needing space need a space 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.990
 who fired a shot given more space 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 if I die now because I came in here 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 A little case of giving of video does not 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.649
 press space is cia 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'll just move the mouse is just a mess 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 previous mouse only 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.070
 only in the bad example now with that of a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 w just squeeze and not forward and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.640
 then the right soul does not change 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.899
 stay inside facing tap 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.129
 kw today will get a good speed 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.209
 understood now with dna and is a bit 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.470
 more complicated 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.930
 I admit 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.790
 a little bit to catch but the disappointment is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.750
 press ow 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.980
 I was able to change the front 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.270
 to the country press forward with w 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.950
 then press first if you want 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.840
 the village can choose to only 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.000
 tightening the clamping bird will tightening al 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.580
 change the previous date 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.730
 coast close to touching the mouse 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.810
 now from ow forward and from w 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:00.959
 boot up insurance runs by there 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:09.270
 And now I'll put the two together. 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:12.240
 in front of the mute power of a de dn and there 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.959
 Come on, come on, it 's just you. 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.420
 Move the mouse. Move the mouse. 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.620
 I just wish I did not get it 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.440
 velocity 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.060
 and it is obvious that they separate the city then 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.820
 This is the only one that I know that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.180
 have amp amp let's give it a little bit more 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.130
 that I 'll show you, but I 'll go 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.550
 traveling in my style I do not want to teach 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.550
 more 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.150
 Our Classmate and Class Video Cards 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.769
 Should you ask those who do not 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.079

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.569
 so with various obstacles 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.250
 usually they stay here but I terrorism 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.010
 I mean to be empty to show that the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.930
 terrorist who pushes the button will drop the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.349
 objective of the terrorist was you who you 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.989

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:16.650
 team had and so here you can

 see this haiti just put in google and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.160
 sting that you do not see that you 've come to 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.780
 advantage you can play and so far it's a 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.099
 diamond on twitter for those who do not like 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:35.020
