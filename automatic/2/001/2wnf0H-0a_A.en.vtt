00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
just got to get that water pump I was

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.690 
just got to get that water pump I was
talking<00:02:48.350> about<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.739> another<00:02:48.830> video<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.370> had

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
talking about it in another video I had

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.650 
talking about it in another video I had
and<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:52.220> water<00:02:52.400> pump<00:02:52.610> went<00:02:52.850> out<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.630> was

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
and the water pump went out like it was

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.310 
and the water pump went out like it was
about<00:02:53.810> original<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:55.489> replaced<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.209> with<00:02:56.480> a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
about original so replaced it with a

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.550 
about original so replaced it with a
rebuilt<00:02:57.799> one<00:02:58.010> from<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.250> Napa<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.640> lasted<00:02:59.180> me

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
rebuilt one from the Napa that lasted me

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.640 
rebuilt one from the Napa that lasted me
almost<00:03:00.640> 15<00:03:01.640> minutes<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.330> then<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.320> bearings

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
almost 15 minutes and then the bearings

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.070 
almost 15 minutes and then the bearings
ate<00:03:03.890> themselves<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> got<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.000> take<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.900> new

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
ate themselves so I got to take the new

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.050 
ate themselves so I got to take the new
water<00:03:06.320> pump<00:03:06.560> out<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:07.040> ate<00:03:07.160> itself<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:07.880> then

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060

water pump out that ate itself and then
get<00:03:08.269> another<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.019> put<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.350> here<00:03:09.470> I

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
get another one and put it in here I

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.890

open<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> hood<00:03:28.549> here

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

very<00:03:40.120> oily<00:03:40.330> under<00:03:40.750> here

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
very oily under here

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.470 
very oily under here
my<00:03:41.440> PCB<00:03:41.950> lines<00:03:42.220> aren't<00:03:42.910> hooked<00:03:43.150> into<00:03:43.300> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
my PCB lines aren't hooked into the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.140 
my PCB lines aren't hooked into the
valve<00:03:43.660> cover<00:03:43.930> anymore<00:03:44.290> they<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:45.000> rotted<00:03:46.000> off

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
valve cover anymore they just rotted off
