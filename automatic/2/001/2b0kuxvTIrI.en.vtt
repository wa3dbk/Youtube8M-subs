so this is one of the it can be one of
the<00:00:07.770> harder<00:00:08.069> puzzles<00:00:08.460> if<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.670> don't<00:00:08.849> look

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
the harder puzzles if you don't look

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.959 
the harder puzzles if you don't look
around<00:00:09.300> good<00:00:09.450> enough

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
around good enough

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.299 
around good enough
you're<00:00:11.900> gonna<00:00:12.019> see<00:00:12.259> how<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:12.709> do<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.070> here<00:00:13.160> in<00:00:13.250> a

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
you're gonna see how I do it here in a

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.310 
you're gonna see how I do it here in a
minute

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
minute

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.750 
minute
once<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.220> actually

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
once you know how to do it it's actually

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.220 
once you know how to do it it's actually
more<00:00:17.880> tedious<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.449> everything<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
more tedious and everything because it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.870 
more tedious and everything because it
requires<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> combination<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.189> climbing<00:00:20.820> up

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
requires a combination of climbing up

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
requires a combination of climbing up
areas<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> jumping<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.020> areas<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:23.010> really

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
areas and jumping down areas it's really

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.330 
areas and jumping down areas it's really
unnecessary<00:00:23.640> they<00:00:24.150> kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.360> do<00:00:24.509> it<00:00:24.630> just

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
unnecessary they kind of do it just

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.609 
unnecessary they kind of do it just
bother<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.520> I'm<00:00:26.640> guessing<00:00:27.169> so<00:00:28.169> these<00:00:28.320> fly

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
bother you I'm guessing so these fly

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
bother you I'm guessing so these fly
things<00:00:28.950> are<00:00:29.099> pretty<00:00:29.250> easy<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.520> kill<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.270> like

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
things are pretty easy to kill just like

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
this fly should not be doing this much

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.720 
this fly should not be doing this much
trouble<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.740> there<00:00:56.740> you<00:00:56.890> go<00:00:57.040> now<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.370> can<00:01:00.550> see

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
lit yet my ducky day and then swim under

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.280 
lit yet my ducky day and then swim under
this<00:01:09.490> area<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:11.890> North<00:01:12.400> Western<00:01:13.360> tunnel

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 

these<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:17.010> kind<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.250> eels<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> kill

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
these are kind of eels you want to kill

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
these are kind of eels you want to kill
because<00:01:18.210> we're<00:01:18.480> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:19.220> revisiting

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
because we're going to be revisiting

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
because we're going to be revisiting
this<00:01:20.340> area<00:01:23.480> then<00:01:24.480> you'll<00:01:24.630> find<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.900> demonic

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this area then you'll find this demonic

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
this area then you'll find this demonic
through<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:26.250> demonic<00:01:26.550> growth<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.090> pretty

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
through this demonic growth is pretty

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.970 
through this demonic growth is pretty
tricky<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.230> it<00:01:28.380> might<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
tricky to see so it might take you a

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.330 
tricky to see so it might take you a
little<00:01:29.100> while<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.120> your<00:01:30.270> own<00:01:31.340> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
little while to do it on your own but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.990 
little while to do it on your own but
that's<00:01:32.520> why<00:01:32.640> you're<00:01:32.760> watching<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> guess

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.490 

so<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:40.780> hop<00:01:40.930> up<00:01:41.140> here<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:43.200> you'll<00:01:44.200> have<00:01:44.260> this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
so just hop up here and you'll have this

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500 
so just hop up here and you'll have this
pump<00:01:44.770> right<00:01:44.860> here<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.940> turning<00:01:46.270> this<00:01:46.330> will

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
pump right here and turning this will

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.320 
pump right here and turning this will
activate<00:01:46.750> fire<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.270> gas<00:01:49.480> I<00:01:49.690> should<00:01:49.840> say

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
activate fire with the gas I should say

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.610 
activate fire with the gas I should say
and<00:01:52.330> now<00:01:52.510> we<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.750> gotta<00:01:52.960> travel<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.380> fire

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
and now we just gotta travel the fire

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.460 
and now we just gotta travel the fire
along<00:01:54.480> like<00:01:55.480> I<00:01:55.630> said<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.960> only<00:01:55.990> part<00:01:56.440> that's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
along like I said the only part that's

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.130 
along like I said the only part that's
difficult<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.130> about<00:01:57.370> this<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:58.480> that<00:01:58.870> you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
difficult is about this is that you

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.200 
difficult is about this is that you
actually<00:01:59.170> have<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.620> jump<00:01:59.890> down<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.550> connect<00:02:00.970> to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
actually have to jump down to connect to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.760 
actually have to jump down to connect to
the<00:02:01.330> flames<00:02:01.600> because<00:02:01.900> they<00:02:02.260> just<00:02:02.440> felt<00:02:02.650> like

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
the flames because they just felt like

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.410 
the flames because they just felt like
spacing<00:02:03.250> out<00:02:03.340> just<00:02:03.760> enough<00:02:04.000> where<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> can't

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
spacing out just enough where you can't

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:45.580 
spacing out just enough where you can't
get<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:04.660> up<00:02:04.780> here

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.759 

you<00:02:46.220> no<00:02:46.310> matter<00:02:46.430> how<00:02:46.640> close<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:48.019> get<00:02:48.260> from

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
you no matter how close you can get from

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.540 
you no matter how close you can get from
being<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.160> there<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.550> just<00:02:49.760> cannot<00:02:50.120> grab<00:02:50.360> it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
being up there you just cannot grab it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.040 
being up there you just cannot grab it
so<00:02:52.550> just<00:02:52.730> drop<00:02:52.910> down<00:02:53.150> here<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.420> target<00:02:53.959> it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
so just drop down here and target it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.100 
so just drop down here and target it
from<00:02:54.200> there<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:56.209> target<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.989> right

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
from there and then target it right

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.809 
from there and then target it right
there<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.129> just<00:02:58.160> got<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.459> go<00:02:58.519> back<00:02:58.670> up

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
there and then we just got to go back up
