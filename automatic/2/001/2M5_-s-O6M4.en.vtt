supported<00:00:42.730> as<00:00:42.850> we<00:00:43.000> spoke<00:00:43.239> about<00:00:43.300> in<00:00:43.840> your<00:00:44.019> CAD

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
supported as we spoke about in your CAD

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290 
supported as we spoke about in your CAD
and<00:00:45.040> we'll<00:00:45.190> talk<00:00:45.340> more<00:00:45.489> about<00:00:45.550> that<00:00:45.760> in

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
and we'll talk more about that in

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.170 
and we'll talk more about that in
another<00:00:46.510> video<00:00:46.780> maybe<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.640> we've<00:00:48.880> chosen

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
another video maybe and so we've chosen

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.700 
another video maybe and so we've chosen

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
our STL and open it up you'll see down

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.270

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
over here on the left so our model is

that way in which case you go to facets

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.190 
that way in which case you go to facets
and<00:02:07.660> down<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.950> modify<00:02:09.640> colors<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.899> find

and down to modify colors and to find

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
and down to modify colors and to find
color<00:02:11.440> I'll<00:02:12.069> generally<00:02:12.640> pick<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.360> color<00:02:13.690> up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930

color I'll generally pick a color up
here<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.650> go<00:02:14.920> okay<00:02:15.660> next<00:02:16.660> thing<00:02:16.930> you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
here like so and go okay next thing you

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.220 
here like so and go okay next thing you
want<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.209> process<00:02:19.810> we're<00:02:20.020> pretty

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
want to do is go to process we're pretty

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
want to do is go to process we're pretty

you'll<00:03:14.019> see<00:03:14.079> your<00:03:14.349> progress<00:03:14.609> bar<00:03:15.609> at<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
you'll see your progress bar at the

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.149 
you'll see your progress bar at the
bottom<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.480> your<00:03:16.959> model<00:03:17.230> contains<00:03:17.590> no<00:03:17.859> holes

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
bottom and your model contains no holes

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.179 
bottom and your model contains no holes
if<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.879> does<00:03:19.090> contain<00:03:19.750> holes<00:03:20.049> again<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:21.040> would

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
if it does contain holes again you would

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.250 
if it does contain holes again you would
go<00:03:21.370> over<00:03:21.549> here<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.819> match<00:03:22.329> edges<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.989> fill

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
go over here to match edges and fill

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.729 
go over here to match edges and fill
holes<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.639> let's<00:03:25.030> go<00:03:25.180> back<00:03:25.209> here<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.840> process

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
holes so let's go back here to process

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.569 
holes so let's go back here to process
and<00:03:27.099> now<00:03:27.700> we<00:03:27.760> compensate<00:03:28.569> shrinkage<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.579> this

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
and now we compensate shrinkage and this

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.270 
and now we compensate shrinkage and this
brings<00:03:30.909> up<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.269> machine<00:03:31.810> definitions<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:33.069> hit

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
brings up the machine definitions we hit

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.449 
brings up the machine definitions we hit
apply<00:03:33.699> to<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:35.139> compensates<00:03:36.099> for<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
apply to that this compensates for the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.930 
apply to that this compensates for the
actual<00:03:36.909> resin<00:03:37.479> shrinkage<00:03:37.989> itself<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.519> back<00:03:39.909> to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
actual resin shrinkage itself so back to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.930 
actual resin shrinkage itself so back to
process<00:03:40.629> and<00:03:40.989> now<00:03:41.859> it's<00:03:42.069> time<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> generate

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
process and now it's time to generate

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.699 
process and now it's time to generate
slices<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:44.590> choose<00:03:44.949> our<00:03:45.159> layer<00:03:45.370> thickness

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
slices we choose our layer thickness

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.830 
slices we choose our layer thickness
0.03<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.979> generally<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.609> really<00:03:48.879> good<00:03:49.329> layer

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
0.03 is generally a really good layer

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.569 
0.03 is generally a really good layer
thickness<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.379> work<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:50.769> there's<00:03:51.310> some

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
thickness to work with there's some

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.879 
thickness to work with there's some
times<00:03:51.819> like<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.299> big<00:03:52.989> thicker<00:03:53.260> model<00:03:53.709> that

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
times like on a big thicker model that

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.619 
times like on a big thicker model that
you'll<00:03:54.040> want<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> go<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:55.169> 0.04<00:03:56.169> or<00:03:56.199> 0.05<00:03:57.629> one

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
you'll want to go to 0.04 or 0.05 one

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.659 
you'll want to go to 0.04 or 0.05 one
thing<00:03:58.840> that<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.139> will<00:03:59.379> have<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.680> do<00:04:00.040> each<00:04:00.310> time

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
thing that you will have to do each time

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.080 
thing that you will have to do each time
is<00:04:01.000> start<00:04:01.989> slicing<00:04:02.260> at<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.040> change<00:04:03.699> that<00:04:03.879> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
is start slicing at and change that to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.770 
is start slicing at and change that to
zero<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:05.079> different<00:04:05.760> compensations

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
zero the different compensations

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.569 
zero the different compensations
actually<00:04:07.780> drove<00:04:08.049> part<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.739> piece<00:04:09.069> below

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
actually drove part of this piece below

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.879 
actually drove part of this piece below
the<00:04:09.609> Z<00:04:10.090> zero<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.720> that's<00:04:11.500> why<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.680> gave<00:04:11.859> a

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
the Z zero and that's why I gave a

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.890 
the Z zero and that's why I gave a
negative<00:04:12.310> number<00:04:12.489> but<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.239> always<00:04:13.599> want<00:04:13.810> to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
negative number but you always want to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.649 
negative number but you always want to
start<00:04:14.169> slicing<00:04:14.470> at<00:04:14.889> zero<00:04:15.250> also<00:04:15.849> we<00:04:16.299> want<00:04:16.510> to

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
start slicing at zero also we want to

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.930 
start slicing at zero also we want to
delete<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:16.989> triangle<00:04:17.530> data<00:04:17.739> after<00:04:18.459> slicing

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
delete the triangle data after slicing

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.240 
delete the triangle data after slicing
that's<00:04:19.120> your<00:04:19.269> STL<00:04:19.750> triangle<00:04:20.650> information

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
that's your STL triangle information

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.129 
that's your STL triangle information
it'll<00:04:21.669> help<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:21.970> your<00:04:22.180> file<00:04:22.389> smaller<00:04:22.780> and

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
it'll help make your file smaller and

it'll help make your file smaller and
more<00:04:23.409> manageable<00:04:23.470> we<00:04:24.250> hit<00:04:24.400> OK<00:04:24.699> here<00:04:24.970> and

more manageable we hit OK here and

notice now we do in fact have our piece
sliced<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:32.340> show<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.370> lot<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.789> slices<00:04:34.210> you

I<00:04:40.539> believe<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.320> default

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
I believe the default

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.460 
I believe the default
is<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.310> show<00:04:42.520> every<00:04:42.940> ten<00:04:43.210> slices<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:44.110> which

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
is to show every ten slices in which

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.590 
is to show every ten slices in which
case<00:04:44.740> your<00:04:44.950> model<00:04:45.250> will<00:04:45.550> look<00:04:45.580> like<00:04:45.730> this<00:04:45.940> even

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
case your model will look like this even

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.360 
case your model will look like this even
though<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:46.780> looks<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.530> though<00:04:47.800> it's

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
though it looks like this though it's

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.480 
though it looks like this though it's
still<00:04:48.720> showing<00:04:49.720> only<00:04:50.050> every<00:04:50.590> ten<00:04:50.800> slices<00:04:51.100> and

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
still showing only every ten slices and

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.600 
still showing only every ten slices and
it<00:04:51.580> is<00:04:51.730> in<00:04:52.000> fact<00:04:52.030> much<00:04:52.660> finer<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:54.100> now<00:04:54.550> that

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
it is in fact much finer so now that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.670 
it is in fact much finer so now that
we've<00:04:54.820> got<00:04:55.000> it<00:04:55.150> sliced<00:04:55.480> we<00:04:55.960> go<00:04:56.140> down<00:04:56.350> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
we've got it sliced we go down to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.770 
we've got it sliced we go down to
generate<00:04:57.250> hatches<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:58.590> we<00:04:59.590> choose<00:04:59.950> ok<00:05:00.780> this

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
generate hatches and we choose ok this

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.860 
generate hatches and we choose ok this
generates<00:05:02.380> basically<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.310> laser<00:05:03.670> path<00:05:04.120> for

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
generates basically the laser path for

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.030 
generates basically the laser path for
the<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.490> model<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.140> we've<00:05:08.140> got<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.740> now<00:05:09.010> right

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
the the model and we've got it now right

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.690 
the the model and we've got it now right
here<00:05:09.820> if<00:05:10.450> in<00:05:10.780> fact<00:05:11.050> we<00:05:11.470> wanted<00:05:11.890> more<00:05:12.310> than<00:05:12.490> one

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
here if in fact we wanted more than one

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.980 
here if in fact we wanted more than one
part<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.360> here<00:05:14.100> we<00:05:15.100> would<00:05:15.340> go<00:05:15.460> down<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.990> setup

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
part on here we would go down to setup

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.040 
part on here we would go down to setup
and<00:05:17.290> that<00:05:17.670> changes<00:05:18.670> your<00:05:18.820> interface<00:05:19.300> so<00:05:19.960> we've

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
and that changes your interface so we've

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.230 
and that changes your interface so we've
got<00:05:20.260> repair<00:05:20.620> mode<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.070> setup<00:05:21.400> mode<00:05:21.610> when

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
got repair mode and setup mode when

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.050 
got repair mode and setup mode when
you're<00:05:22.360> in<00:05:22.510> setup<00:05:22.810> mode<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.860> can<00:05:24.280> hold<00:05:24.910> your

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
you're in setup mode you can hold your

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.240 
you're in setup mode you can hold your
cursor<00:05:25.270> over<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.870> model<00:05:26.230> right-click<00:05:27.010> and

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
cursor over the model right-click and

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.950 
cursor over the model right-click and
choose<00:05:28.020> duplicate<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:30.400> then<00:05:30.640> we'll

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
choose duplicate and this then we'll

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.110 
choose duplicate and this then we'll
duplicate<00:05:31.960> however<00:05:32.440> many<00:05:32.680> numbers<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.880> want

duplicate however many numbers you want

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.020 
duplicate however many numbers you want
let's<00:05:34.540> put<00:05:34.870> two<00:05:35.230> that'll<00:05:36.010> add<00:05:36.220> two<00:05:36.520> more<00:05:36.700> parts

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
let's put two that'll add two more parts

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.830 
let's put two that'll add two more parts

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
and grow at this point but if in fact

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.950 
and grow at this point but if in fact
you<00:05:44.140> wanted<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.760> move<00:05:45.760> or<00:05:46.030> rotate<00:05:46.150> anything

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
you wanted to move or rotate anything

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.410 
you wanted to move or rotate anything
that<00:05:47.470> would<00:05:47.680> be<00:05:47.770> possible<00:05:48.370> by<00:05:48.640> choosing<00:05:49.030> for

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
that would be possible by choosing for

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.830 
that would be possible by choosing for
example<00:05:49.870> pick<00:05:50.200> and<00:05:50.410> move<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:52.150> can<00:05:52.540> then

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
example pick and move and you can then

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.550 
example pick and move and you can then
move<00:05:53.710> your<00:05:53.770> pieces<00:05:54.760> around<00:05:55.720> in<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:55.990> platform

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
move your pieces around in the platform

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.980 
move your pieces around in the platform
this<00:05:57.190> is<00:05:57.250> very<00:05:57.670> helpful<00:05:58.150> if<00:05:58.330> you've<00:05:58.570> been

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
this is very helpful if you've been

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.510 
this is very helpful if you've been
growing<00:05:59.230> all<00:05:59.410> your<00:05:59.620> pieces<00:05:59.830> in<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.220> middle

your tray is going to get fogged so

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.320 
your tray is going to get fogged so
you'll<00:06:03.100> want<00:06:03.400> to<00:06:03.610> draw<00:06:03.820> them<00:06:03.970> in<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.150> different

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
you'll want to draw them in a different

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.230 
you'll want to draw them in a different
position<00:06:04.710> so<00:06:05.710> now<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.250> only<00:06:06.580> thing<00:06:06.850> left<00:06:06.880> to

do<00:06:07.510> then<00:06:07.810> as<00:06:08.020> long<00:06:08.650> as<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:08.920> make<00:06:09.100> sure<00:06:09.130> that

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
do then as long as you make sure that

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.420 
do then as long as you make sure that
this<00:06:10.150> hierarchy<00:06:10.960> is<00:06:11.080> clicked<00:06:11.410> this<00:06:11.980> will<00:06:12.280> then

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
this hierarchy is clicked this will then

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.720 
this hierarchy is clicked this will then
include<00:06:12.970> all<00:06:13.240> of<00:06:13.270> your<00:06:13.510> parts<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.710> go<00:06:14.920> to<00:06:14.980> file

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
include all of your parts you go to file

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.460 
include all of your parts you go to file
save<00:06:16.480> as<00:06:16.540> and<00:06:17.370> this<00:06:18.370> saves<00:06:18.670> it<00:06:18.880> as<00:06:19.060> an<00:06:19.300> MKR<00:06:20.110> file

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
save as and this saves it as an MKR file

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.360 
save as and this saves it as an MKR file
and<00:06:21.120> at<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.420> point<00:06:22.750> all<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.560> need<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:23.890> do<00:06:24.040> is

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
and at that point all you need to do is

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.600 
and at that point all you need to do is
simply<00:06:25.270> say<00:06:25.540> that<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:26.740> save<00:06:27.010> actually<00:06:27.460> will

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
simply say that the save actually will

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.730 
simply say that the save actually will
take<00:06:27.790> a<00:06:27.820> few<00:06:28.120> minutes<00:06:28.270> because<00:06:28.690> it<00:06:29.140> is<00:06:29.170> simply

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
take a few minutes because it is simply

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.580 
take a few minutes because it is simply
assembling<00:06:30.610> all<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.180> data<00:06:31.480> that<00:06:32.320> you've

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
assembling all of the data that you've

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.620 
assembling all of the data that you've
put<00:06:32.920> together<00:06:33.040> so<00:06:33.640> it's<00:06:33.880> not<00:06:34.060> just<00:06:34.300> a<00:06:34.390> click

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
put together so it's not just a click
