00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
ok here is phase one of my biochemical

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.470 
ok here is phase one of my biochemical
barrels<00:00:09.129> the<00:00:10.059> toxic<00:00:10.570> barrels<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:13.030> had<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:13.269> cut

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
barrels the toxic barrels we had to cut

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.839 
barrels the toxic barrels we had to cut
these<00:00:13.690> these<00:00:14.410> 55-gallon<00:00:15.219> barrels<00:00:15.519> actually

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
these these 55-gallon barrels actually

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.980 
these these 55-gallon barrels actually
had<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.090> lids<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.570> were<00:00:17.439> not<00:00:18.099> detachable<00:00:19.000> so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
had the lids that were not detachable so

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.310 
had the lids that were not detachable so
we<00:00:20.200> had<00:00:20.380> to<00:00:20.529> cut<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:21.040> lids<00:00:21.310> off<00:00:21.640> them<00:00:22.259> using<00:00:23.259> a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
we had to cut the lids off them using a

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.850 
we had to cut the lids off them using a
jigsaw<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:25.090> circular<00:00:25.570> saw<00:00:25.599> on<00:00:26.230> one<00:00:26.560> because

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
jigsaw and a circular saw on one because

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.179 
jigsaw and a circular saw on one because
it<00:00:27.489> was<00:00:27.640> really<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.300> lot<00:00:28.899> thicker<00:00:29.230> but<00:00:29.860> anyway

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
it was really a lot thicker but anyway

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.549 
it was really a lot thicker but anyway
we<00:00:30.309> cut<00:00:30.489> the<00:00:30.640> tops<00:00:30.939> of<00:00:31.210> these<00:00:31.329> off<00:00:31.630> which<00:00:32.349> we're

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
we cut the tops of these off which we're

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.270 
we cut the tops of these off which we're
supreme<00:00:32.950> painting<00:00:33.399> over<00:00:33.700> there<00:00:34.530> ok<00:00:35.530> so<00:00:35.590> we're

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280

to<00:00:47.140> add<00:00:47.260> around<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.680> tops<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.190> barrels

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
to add around the tops of the barrels

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.280 
to add around the tops of the barrels
and<00:00:48.880> then<00:00:49.150> we're<00:00:49.360> going<00:00:49.450> to<00:00:49.540> cover<00:00:49.750> those<00:00:49.990> with

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
of the barrel and then this is the front

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.600 
of the barrel and then this is the front
where<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.900> molten<00:01:23.560> like<00:01:23.860> all<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:24.280> mean

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
where the molten like all that I mean

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
all the toxic garbage is going to be

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.260 
all the toxic garbage is going to be
kind<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.680> spilling<00:01:27.070> out<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.400> front<00:01:27.640> so

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
kind of spilling out of the front so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.820

being<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.840> front<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.229> valve<00:01:29.409> mark<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.770> do

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
being the front of the valve mark and do

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.860 
being the front of the valve mark and do
the<00:01:29.920> whole<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.430> whole<00:01:30.610> thing<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.299> then<00:01:31.840> I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
the whole the whole thing and then I

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.430 
the whole the whole thing and then I
wrapped<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:33.040> Rope<00:01:33.280> through<00:01:34.290> drilled<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.409> hole

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
wrapped the Rope through drilled a hole

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
wrapped the Rope through drilled a hole
put<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.159> through<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.340> hole<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:39.340> I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
put it through the hole and then I

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.130 
put it through the hole and then I
wrapped<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.850> around<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.240> inside<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.630> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
wrapped it around the inside of the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
wrapped it around the inside of the
barrel<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.610> will<00:01:42.700> glow<00:01:43.030> from<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.360> inside

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
barrel so it will glow from the inside

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.710 
barrel so it will glow from the inside
I've<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:47.080> cover<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.850> rope<00:01:48.850> light<00:01:49.090> over<00:01:49.450> with

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
I've to cover the rope light over with

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.170 
I've to cover the rope light over with
great<00:01:50.320> stuff<00:01:50.619> foam<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.220> then<00:01:51.400> spray<00:01:51.760> paint<00:01:52.030> it

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
then I'll finish off the inside of the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.960 
then I'll finish off the inside of the
barrel<00:01:55.680> ok<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.890> apply<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> great<00:01:57.909> stuff

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
to put on top of that barrel left just

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.330 
to put on top of that barrel left just
so<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.930> thing<00:03:13.370> will<00:03:14.370> pop<00:03:14.609> up<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:16.319> one<00:03:16.980> barrel

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
so this thing will pop up so one barrel

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.329 
so this thing will pop up so one barrel
down<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.879> more<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.180> go
