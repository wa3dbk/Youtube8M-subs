00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.670
 we are going to prepare tuna and tomato soup 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 with rice the ingredients that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.400
 we need 240 grams of tuna 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.099
 natural a chopped onion 2 cloves 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.159
 garlic 80 grams of rice a zucchini in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 dice 400 grams of crushed tomato 100 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.419
 milliliters of light cream milk cream 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.679
 half cream for cooking or as 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:28.470
 substitute milk and 600 milliliters of water 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.479
 we started draining our tuna from 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.609
 the footprint that it carries in the can and 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:35.879
 we will reserve both things both the 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:39.989
 water like the tuna and we continue 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.809
 taking a cacerolita and throwing some 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.449
 three teaspoons of oil we 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.449
 we heat and we will pass the onion 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.240
 we also add the chopped garlic 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 and we will leave it until it is 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.200
 blandita we put a little salt 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.040
 to improve the footprint and strikeouts 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 best 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.530
 and when it's soft, we'll add the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.850
 crushed tomato we add another pinch 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.299
 of salt 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.659
 and we'll move it and sautÃ© about ten 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.040
 minutes past this time we add the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.040
 hot water 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 and in the jar that is half a liter and 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.049
 we need a little more we miss 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.360
 600 milliliters of water and we add the 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.450
 Caldito that they had released the cans of 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.570
 tuna and we incorporate it into our pot 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.930
 when it starts to boil we will add the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.930
 rice 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.700
 and from here we will count 20 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 minutes this is very important because it is 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 what it takes the rice to be done and what 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.960
 what will we calculate to finish our 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960
 Soup 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.179
 if we see that it is necessary we add another 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.549
 little salt 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.010
 and when about 10 minutes of 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.969
 cooking of the rice we will add the dice 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.969
 of zucchini 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.510
 As a last step, we are going to cover up 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.030
 Do not evaporate anymore and do not leave us a 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.030
 paste because the rice sucks a lot of water 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.330
 as a penultimate step we add our 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.410
 cream that also serves us milk if the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.410
 we want lighter 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.830
 as we see well 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.740
 we add a little pepper 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.390
 and we remove it from the fire because it will be 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.640
 ready 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.920
 finally we add the tuna out of the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.920
 fire because as it is already cooked and done 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.990
 we do not want to dry out is better 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.530
 throw it out when the soup is finished 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.220
 and now we have our tuna soup 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.920
 with tomato and rice resulting in a dish 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.880
 very complete and healthy because it has everything 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.880
 type of nutrients and it is also 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.880
 delicious
