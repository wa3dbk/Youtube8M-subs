00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
on this device or project on this device

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.119 
on this device or project on this device
and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> apps<00:00:53.600> if<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.989> tablet<00:00:55.980> apps

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and then the apps if I have tablet apps

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.799 
and then the apps if I have tablet apps
Internet<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.910> fhd<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.510> scale

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
Internet which are fhd they scale

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.470 
Internet which are fhd they scale
beautifully<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.300> great<00:01:00.300> app

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.680 
beautifully so now I see a great app
that<00:01:00.780> scaled<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.379> nicely<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.120> 4k<00:01:03.510> 2k

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that scaled up nicely to the the 4k 2k

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
that scaled up nicely to the the 4k 2k
resolution<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.670> gives<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> great

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060

value<00:01:06.350> beyond<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.159> 4k<00:01:08.520> 2k<00:01:08.700> panel

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
value beyond just the 4k 2k panel

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
value beyond just the 4k 2k panel

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
itself will have on the back we have

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
itself will have on the back we have
multiple<00:01:32.400> inputs<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
multiple inputs so if you look on the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.230 
multiple inputs so if you look on the
back<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.740> you'll<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.130> multiple<00:01:35.520> HDMI

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
back here you'll see multiple HDMI

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.069 
back here you'll see multiple HDMI
display<00:01:36.659> ports<00:01:37.700> Ethernet<00:01:38.729> I've<00:01:39.299> got<00:01:39.420> USBs<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
display ports Ethernet I've got USBs on

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.310 
display ports Ethernet I've got USBs on
the<00:01:40.170> side<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> could<00:01:40.860> put<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.490> large

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the side so you could put a large

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.539 
the side so you could put a large
capacity<00:01:43.320> hard<00:01:43.530> drive<00:01:43.710> connected<00:01:44.130> into<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
capacity hard drive connected into it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
capacity hard drive connected into it
and<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.790> access<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> content<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.930> well<00:01:46.170> back

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and in access that content as well back
