00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
kind of like gets going doesn't get

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.900 
kind of like gets going doesn't get
going<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.739> kind<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.130> frustrates<00:03:11.550> me<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
going I kind of frustrates me so

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.430 
going I kind of frustrates me so
plugging<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.480> directly<00:03:12.810> get<00:03:12.989> better<00:03:13.170> sound

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
plugging and directly get better sound

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.500 
plugging and directly get better sound
but<00:03:14.220> there<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.430> decent<00:03:14.550> pair<00:03:14.880> headsets<00:03:15.330> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
but there are decent pair headsets and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.970 
but there are decent pair headsets and
I'm<00:03:15.930> not<00:03:16.080> sure<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:16.410> retail<00:03:16.739> for<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
I'm not sure what they retail for I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.890 
I'm not sure what they retail for I
think<00:03:17.100> they<00:03:17.340> retail<00:03:17.670> for<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:18.180> hundred<00:03:18.540> dollars

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
think they retail for a hundred dollars

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 
think they retail for a hundred dollars
so<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.769> they're<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.130> are<00:03:20.340> priced<00:03:20.610> to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.280 
so I think they're really are priced to
sell<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.570> ahead<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.720> check<00:03:21.900> them<00:03:22.049> out<00:03:22.170> I'll
