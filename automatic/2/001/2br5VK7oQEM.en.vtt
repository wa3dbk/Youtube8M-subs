was<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> secondhand<00:00:08.370> strap<00:00:08.700> when<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.910> bought<00:00:09.120> it

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150

was a secondhand strap when I bought it
so<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.570> think<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.870> was<00:00:09.960> made<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.290> 1980<00:00:11.509> 1988<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
so I think it was made in 1980 1988 and

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.680 
so I think it was made in 1980 1988 and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.090 
focal switch by the way as if this one
has<00:01:00.960> every<00:01:01.199> type<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> switch<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> ever<00:01:01.949> seen

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630 
sofa somewhere it's a toggle Ferrari
yeah<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.530> thought<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.490> be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
yeah so I kind of thought it would be

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
yeah so I kind of thought it would be
kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> fun<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.270> wouldn't<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.869> cat<00:01:10.080> ten

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
kind of fun it wouldn't be the cat ten

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
kind of fun it wouldn't be the cat ten
although<00:01:11.130> ml<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.580> isn't<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> million<00:01:12.119> miles

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
although ml one isn't a million miles

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.039 
although ml one isn't a million miles
away<00:01:12.659> from<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.110> sort<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.409> capitaine<00:01:14.360> B<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
away from a sort of a capitaine B so I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.080 
away from a sort of a capitaine B so I
just<00:01:16.350> thought<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.100> fun<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.640> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
just thought this would be fun and it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510 
just thought this would be fun and it's
kind<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.390> ended<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> slightly

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
kind of ended up so it's a slightly

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
kind of ended up so it's a slightly
wider<00:01:20.820> neck<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> slightly<00:01:24.270> wider

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
wider neck then it's a slightly wider

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:39.050 
wider neck then it's a slightly wider
neck<00:01:25.640> strap<00:01:26.810> sounds<00:01:27.810> pretty<00:01:28.020> similar<00:01:38.060> same

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
stuck it on the guitars and then

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.410 
stuck it on the guitars and then
somebody<00:02:09.430> said<00:02:09.640> oh<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.790> should<00:02:09.880> do<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.180> so

the<00:02:16.030> pentatonic<00:02:16.480> isn't<00:02:16.870> it

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
the pentatonic isn't it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.110 
the pentatonic isn't it
you<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:18.600> Felix<00:02:19.600> who<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:21.220> over<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> nose<00:02:21.730> Felix

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
you can Felix who you over a nose Felix

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.860 
you can Felix who you over a nose Felix
right<00:02:22.440> Felix<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.620> everything<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.810> pencil<00:02:25.810> on

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
right Felix is everything is pencil on

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.590 
right Felix is everything is pencil on
the<00:02:25.960> scale<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.100> just<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:28.090> played<00:02:28.300> like

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
the scale and it's just but played like

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.580 
the scale and it's just but played like
100<00:02:29.080> times<00:02:29.260> faster<00:02:29.440> than<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.920> play<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
100 times faster than I can play and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.680 
100 times faster than I can play and
with<00:02:32.610> that's<00:02:33.610> release<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.330> kind<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
with that's release and so you kind of

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.830 
with that's release and so you kind of
realized<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.640> there's<00:02:36.640> not<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> lot<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.660> you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
realized that there's not a lot that you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.990 
realized that there's not a lot that you
can't<00:02:38.230> fit<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.040> probably<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.670> you're<00:02:39.850> not

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
can't fit in so probably that you're not

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.060 
can't fit in so probably that you're not
playing<00:02:40.800> provided<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:41.890> you're

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
playing provided that you're

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.620 
playing provided that you're
fundamentally<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:42.850> doing<00:02:43.120> all<00:02:43.300> sorts<00:02:43.570> of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
fundamentally not doing all sorts of

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.570 
fundamentally not doing all sorts of
weird<00:02:43.870> awkward<00:02:44.200> key<00:02:44.770> changes<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.460> time

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
weird awkward key changes all the time

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.250 
weird awkward key changes all the time
and<00:02:46.000> most<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.510> tombs<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.930> you're<00:02:47.080> trying

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
and most of the tombs that you're trying

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.930 
and most of the tombs that you're trying
to<00:02:47.320> jam<00:02:47.530> along<00:02:47.770> with<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.070> fundamentally<00:02:48.700> stay

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
to jam along with and fundamentally stay

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.290 
to jam along with and fundamentally stay
to<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.150> fairly<00:02:49.530> normal<00:02:50.530> structure<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.090> think

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
to a fairly normal structure and I think

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.030 
to a fairly normal structure and I think
that<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> only<00:02:52.810> thing<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.290> before<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.770> even

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that the only thing is I before I even

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that the only thing is I before I even
learnt<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.970> pentatonic<00:02:55.420> scale<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:57.730> play

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
learnt the pentatonic scale I don't play

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.120 
learnt the pentatonic scale I don't play
any<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> shapes<00:02:59.110> I<00:03:01.739> wouldn't<00:03:02.739> play<00:03:02.920> that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
any of the shapes I wouldn't play that

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.520 
any of the shapes I wouldn't play that
that<00:03:03.280> feels<00:03:03.520> uncomfortable<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:04.270> me<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.170> play

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
that feels uncomfortable to me so I play

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.000 
that feels uncomfortable to me so I play
all<00:03:05.709> mine<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.280> shapes<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.970> don't<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.630> play

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
all mine in shapes I don't like to play

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.300 
all mine in shapes I don't like to play
what's<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.800> don't<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.250> don't

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
what's that right I don't like I don't

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.880 
what's that right I don't like I don't
like<00:03:12.550> that<00:03:13.120> feels<00:03:13.480> uncomfortable<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:14.680> don't

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
like that feels uncomfortable so I don't

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.380 
like that feels uncomfortable so I don't
like<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.830> all<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.220> shape<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.820> like<00:03:19.060> all<00:03:19.209> my

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
like I like all my shape I like all my

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:32.810 
like I like all my shape I like all my
intervals<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.560> be<00:03:20.700> too<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.130> learn

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.370 

getting<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:34.000> three<00:03:34.330> different<00:03:34.720> positions<00:03:34.840> of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
getting to three different positions of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.560 
getting to three different positions of
it<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.709> starting<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.400> beginning<00:03:36.520> I<00:03:36.970> learn

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it so starting in the beginning I learn

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.130 
it so starting in the beginning I learn
that<00:03:37.720> later<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.560> what<00:03:38.709> I'm<00:03:38.830> doing<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.160> starting

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.780 

that's<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.260> fifth<00:03:44.530> have<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.190> got<00:03:45.340> first

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:00.899 

so<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:52.120> don't<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.409> play<00:03:58.920> see<00:03:59.920> he<00:04:00.220> uses<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> three

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
so I don't so I play see he uses a three

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.759 
so I don't so I play see he uses a three
octave<00:04:01.920> bass<00:04:02.920> much<00:04:03.250> much<00:04:03.489> yes<00:04:03.970> that's<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.530> my

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
octave bass much much yes that's in my

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.729 
octave bass much much yes that's in my
opinion<00:04:05.799> easy<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.909> play<00:04:07.120> then<00:04:07.810> staying<00:04:08.470> within

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
opinion easy to play then staying within

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.420 
opinion easy to play then staying within
one<00:04:09.220> position<00:04:10.650> yeah<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.950> there's<00:04:12.190> really

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
one position yeah and there's really

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.979 
one position yeah and there's really
only<00:04:12.579> two<00:04:12.760> shapes<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.629> know

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
only two shapes that I know

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.310 
only two shapes that I know
so<00:04:14.379> in<00:04:14.530> English<00:04:14.650> so<00:04:15.370> if<00:04:15.849> I'm<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.239> re<00:04:16.389> free<00:04:16.780> my

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
so in English so if I'm in re free my

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
so in English so if I'm in re free my
root<00:04:17.530> notes<00:04:17.739> here<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:19.150> I've<00:04:19.359> got<00:04:19.510> two

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
root notes here I know I've got two

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:31.770 
root notes here I know I've got two
shapes<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.290> can<00:04:20.500> play<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:31.150> if<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.449> notice

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
shapes that I can play and if you notice

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.040 
shapes that I can play and if you notice
everything<00:04:32.229> I<00:04:32.500> play<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.400> either<00:04:33.669> that<00:04:34.449> firstly

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
everything I play is either that firstly

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.529 
everything I play is either that firstly
either<00:04:35.650> down<00:04:35.889> here<00:04:35.919> or<00:04:36.220> up<00:04:36.550> at<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.970> octave<00:04:37.330> or

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
either down here or up at the octave or

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.020 
either down here or up at the octave or
it's<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> second<00:04:38.320> shape<00:04:38.789> that's<00:04:39.789> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
it's the second shape that's the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.689 
it's the second shape that's the
blaggers<00:04:40.419> guide<00:04:40.660> everything<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.949> then<00:04:42.460> you

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
blaggers guide everything and then you

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.620 
blaggers guide everything and then you
just<00:04:42.940> move<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.389> to<00:04:43.600> wherever<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:45.630> and

just move it to wherever the and

just move it to wherever the and
InterVarsity<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> bit<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.250> I<00:04:48.400> only

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
InterVarsity and the bit that I only

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.250 
InterVarsity and the bit that I only
think<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.240> only<00:04:49.419> thing<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:49.780> anybody<00:04:50.110> ever

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
think the only thing that anybody ever

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.740 
think the only thing that anybody ever
said<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:51.280> mic<00:04:51.580> complimentary<00:04:52.330> about<00:04:52.449> what<00:04:52.720> I

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
said to a mic complimentary about what I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.640 
said to a mic complimentary about what I
play<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.910> feel<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.419> vibrato<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:59.080> I

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
play is the feel and the vibrato and I

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.500 
play is the feel and the vibrato and I
think<00:04:59.919> again<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.930> can<00:05:02.169> sound<00:05:03.210> massively<00:05:04.210> more

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
think again you can sound massively more

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.230 
think again you can sound massively more
accomplished<00:05:05.169> than<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:05.530> really<00:05:05.919> are

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
accomplished than you really are

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.360 
accomplished than you really are
with<00:05:07.240> good<00:05:07.450> vibrato<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.260> go<00:05:08.380> big<00:05:08.620> or<00:05:08.770> go<00:05:08.830> home

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
with good vibrato and go big or go home

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:21.540 
with good vibrato and go big or go home
so<00:05:09.639> you<00:05:09.700> know<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.150> could<00:05:10.300> go<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:20.860> know<00:05:21.370> what<00:05:21.490> are

so you know you could go I know what are

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
the sudden you got a sounding like a

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.779 
the sudden you got a sounding like a

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
beginner it's a sounding like like a

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:34.450 
beginner it's a sounding like like a
blues<00:05:28.120> guitar<00:05:30.060> no

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
sure you don't sure yeah and a lot of

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.980 
sure you don't sure yeah and a lot of
players<00:05:38.190> as<00:05:38.400> well<00:05:38.430> not<00:05:39.330> even<00:05:39.660> necessarily

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
players as well not even necessarily

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.600 
players as well not even necessarily
players<00:05:40.320> that<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.590> particularly<00:05:41.010> like<00:05:41.370> but

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
players that I particularly like but

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.310 
players that I particularly like but
people<00:05:41.940> like<00:05:42.060> Carlos<00:05:42.450> Santana<00:05:42.930> have<00:05:43.170> got<00:05:43.290> a

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
people like Carlos Santana have got a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.880 
people like Carlos Santana have got a
really<00:05:43.730> good<00:05:44.730> attitude<00:05:44.930> towards<00:05:45.930> tone<00:05:46.590> and

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
really good attitude towards tone and

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.590 
really good attitude towards tone and
it's<00:05:47.010> disses<00:05:47.520> replicating<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.180> human<00:05:48.480> voice

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600
