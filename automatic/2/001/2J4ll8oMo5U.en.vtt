00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.590
 episode of the series of my templates 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 of the section of my templates and good 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.849
 this template is a new one that has 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 done the truth quite pretty good 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.680
 an audio template of the barclays is 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.000
 a good template that I have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.380
 done basically because most of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.109
 players have played me as a first 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.340
 owner as the envelopes for example 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.500
 the only ones that I bought has been to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.000
 szczesny 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.890
 I bought fabio 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.500
 and I went back to rodwell that rodwell is worth 350 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.660
 coins and is a great player and about 500 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.900
 out there is also a piece of player 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.670
 and well I also bought Walcott and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.010
 good is a template that is pretty 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.350
 offensive the center of the field is very 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.150
 pull forward and I want to recommend this 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.129
 alignment and more in players the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.519
 Barclays because the players talk 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.129
 of the barclays have the fastest 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.780
 majority and this alignment 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.300
 not to be the counterattack but to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.610
 have control of the ball in the center 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.850
 field and then do the unchecks and go 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 very good if you have fast ends and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.350
 with good dribble and such and good it is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.060
 a template that's good if it can come out 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 a bit expensive but that is very good and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.229
 well I wanted to show you this template 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.820
 which is what I have done and as always 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.500

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.880
 leave a compilation of the goals 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.860

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.570
 finish 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:05.580
 in that language 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 people enjoy finding action in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.720
 certain driving mode 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.510
