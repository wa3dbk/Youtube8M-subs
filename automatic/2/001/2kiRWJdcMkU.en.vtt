00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 so friends continue to learn again 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.120
 collect rubik's cube with closed 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 eyes we already know how to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 keep the cube already know with you 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.210
 West combination already know where we are with 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.029
 you buffer between the white and red center 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.900
 and we already know how to shower some 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.310
 balls that is Circuits or rather ribs 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.140
 your baskets 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.760
 baskets this places where they should 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 be let's repeat it again 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 if we have white in the buffer 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 orange detail we understand 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 that her basket is on top and just 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 make the combination west this way 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.289
 we always put it in its place 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 you have white orange in the buffer 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.629
 Circuits just make a combination of west 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.000
 and you can't go wrong there are situations 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.650
 more about them I told you too 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 for example in this case the buffer and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 It is not white and orange Circuits 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 green orange detail and basket for 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.229
 green orange detail is not 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.890
 on top 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.830
 and on the side then we can't just do 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 west combination we have to make one 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.409
 installation course or in English 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 this sounds setups which we raise 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 we put our cart up there 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.130
 we throw the ball is the second 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.670
 part of the algorithm that is directly 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.670
 combination of west and third part 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.920
 Algorithm cancel our installation move 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:58.229
 returning our basket in place but 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:01.290
 another case in this case is in buffer y 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.180
 we have a blue orange detail 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.369
 Well, that is, suppose it is blue 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.350
 orange basketball which we 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.340
 should throw in the basket which 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.650
 located behind the right and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.260
 cart we are using the installation stroke 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.440
 l raise the top of the cube 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.170
 the second part of the algorithms do 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.739
 combination for the same and the third part of the cube 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 we return our basket to its place 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.879
 it would seem that the installation moves 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 consist of just one move and all 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:38.090
 not so difficult but there are situations when 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.000
 adjusting moves consists of more than 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.670
 one move from two and even from three and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.170
 such situations may cause you 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 some problems here for example one of 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.390
 such situations in the buffer we have 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.410
 blue orange detail let's do it again 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:11.840
 remember the situation here now 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:14.660
 I will model here on this cubes in the buffer 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.510
 blue is orange it Circuits 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.239
 This cubes in the buffer is not blue 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.290
 orange and blue, orange Circuits 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.950
 it would seem what's the difference but believe me 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.709
 there is a difference in this case 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:39.069
 the installation course is very simple of all 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:41.750
 just l make a combination of west and 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.139
 let's return the basket to its place 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:52.400
 try to make an installation move here 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:55.819
 cal combination west and return on 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.799
 The place that turned out the detail got on 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.950
 a place but where there should be blue 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.319
 we got an orange sticker and there 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.190
 where should be orange we have blue 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.290
 all why because we are so far and what with 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.470
 you have done wrong and now I 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.859
 I will show how correctly in this case we 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.920
 must understand that we have on top 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.310
 there is an orange sticker 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:26.190
 and on the right is blue so the main sticker 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:32.350
 we will have an orange and in this case 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:35.230
 the main thing we have is blue so if 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.230
 detail blue orange then basket 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.220
 located next to the blue center that is 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.160
 here and if detailka orange blue 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.700
 then the basket is next to the orange 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.950
 center that is here now i 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:57.250
 I put my finger on the basket and lift it 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:02.530
 up and see that the finger is not on 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:06.010
 the top is not here but on the left it means 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.470
 only that we did not raise the basket where 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.590
 we need a question and how can we raise 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:18.030
 cart right here for this we need 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 more complex installation course attention 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:30.790
 we twist the bottom two layers without 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:32.740
 intercepting the cube and see that the basket 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.040
 now we have turned the front 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.710
 if we make an r-stroke move then the basket 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:43.390
 will be where we need now we 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.330
 make the combination west and cancel our 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.940
 complex installation move first we 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.060
 did double movement more precisely not 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.270
 double movement and the movement of the lower two 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.980
 extreme and then we made the r-stroke move 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.470
 now we return in reverse 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:05.320
 okay do l and twist the bottom two 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.860
 verge so returning the cart on 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.860
 your place
