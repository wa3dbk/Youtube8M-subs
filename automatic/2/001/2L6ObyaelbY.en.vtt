 plot without greenhouse and more often this greenhouse 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.670
 polycarbonate 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.610
 there we grow a heat-loving plant 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.870
 cucumbers tomatoes and peppers are growing there now 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.940
 melons and watermelons 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.539

 plants have a hot problem and and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.840
 triggered by hot weather in June-July 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.230
 the sun scorched so the vegetable plants in

 material 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 this is massed polycarbonate 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.770
 a density of one kilogram per meter 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.829
 lead get well diffused light

 interest street gardeners causes a new 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 development and play innovation pipets and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.930
 mitlayder that's enough 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.049
 innovative greenhouse provides
