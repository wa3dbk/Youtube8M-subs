00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.320
 a few years ago heineken 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.930
 holland basket and agrifirm plant each other 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.490
 found in sustainability objectives 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.390
 and we wanted to be together and sustainable 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.580
 produce beer henk wants him in 2020 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.170
 50% of the ingredients from sustainable 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.120
 get a crop 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.220
 but now you would for once off after 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.710
 that is sustainable woman's mind 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.410
 So Mrs Christmas are the issue by 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.410
 a sustainable taylor has been produced 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.489
 Foundation skylark shows 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.920
 wonderful that farmers freedom to put on their 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.690
 own company to decide which step 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
 sustainability is actually first 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.270
 want to tackle we have meanwhile 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.940
 three years 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.050
 approximately 10,000 tonnes of sustainable brewing barley 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.130
 produced 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.910
 together with our growers that stands for 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 580,000 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.770
 hectolitre beer 29 million sustainable 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.140
 beers good soil is whole 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.220
 important to our company from yes then 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 there must be good returns 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740
 harvested because if there is no money in it 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.880
 There is also no word space 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.350
 sustainability there is no need for money 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 invest in new technologies such as 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.560
 solar panels or gps 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 So we do our best to play that role 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.399
 maintain optimum condition so that we 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.539
 are again where the ground have that there 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.860
 washed healthy we are a good one 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.600
 All of a sudden I was as short as possible 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.800
 to spray 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.080
 within the much more info a whole lot 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.310
 Topics discussed a lot speak the game 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.979
 more and there was also a reason 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.929
 why to go on a nice van 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.300
 skylark is the menu bar more 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.380
 the boiler work together so on 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.570
 now a regular conversation 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.790
 to end 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.290
 the beginning of a great collaboration 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 hope that video also takes longer than you can 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.650
 you respond more to each other's wishes and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.329
 that also fits a bit within the 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.070
 sustainability idea and then come together 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.619
 and a long way from left and right 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.510
 gives growers a woman to buy 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.850
 help who t was to make that more sustainable 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.200
 put ahead 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.060
 and that is important because this project 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.620
 revolves around the transition of the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.840
 food chain is therefore not running so much 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.570
 a more sustainable lawn around the movement 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.850
 that you thereby create in production 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.709
 of the food 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.019
 our objective is not to have a new one 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.670
 food chain next to the construction but just 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.560
 to gradually get higher and higher 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 percentage of sustainably grown 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.579
 washed in our chains because with green 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.880
 we do that too 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.680
 all together were now standing up like you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.380
 that counts to how much beer 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.739
 That is then you can be any adult 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.750
 give the Dutch a glass of beer 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.600
 at the time , the malt houses were set up 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.000
 because it is an ideal logistical situation 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.800
 is we sitting at the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.450
 seas harbor so for that matter 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.920
 We are close to the customer 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.720
 at the same time we are close to the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.030
 barley because here and the immediate surroundings 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.370
 much rest is grown 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.590
 ps as a chain you are together 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.990
 connected and it is also inside 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.900
 skylark eating very nicely to 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.540
 see my talk about it then to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.030
 listen to each other and that way too 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.900
 also tries to have harvest for each others 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.900
 to wish 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.500
 we have a few years ago 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.950
 replace transport via trucks 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.670
 by 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.970
 motorsport renske it saves around 7000 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.370
 the 14,000 truck trips a year 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.230
 I like that kind of initiative 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.600
 that you can both contribute 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.100
 sustainability as to a better one 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.100
 operational management and save costs 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.510
 The nice thing about this work is that you really do 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.410
 am concerned with the quality of it 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.930
 product 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.460
 try fantastically beautiful every day 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.410
 product to be delivered and then also they 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.000
 in such a huge amount 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.100
 so of course mix it nicely then 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.280
 then stand in the pub and together 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.750
 to enjoy it with friends 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.240
 it's great if you go to such 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.160
 long actual phone 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.580
 guests at a taylor field theory can 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.560
 link to producing beer 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.970
 and then you hear from proud to proud 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.150
 feelings that are in the all links of the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:27.510
 chain back here when people think 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.100
 about how they better their 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.230
 can organize activity and late 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.160
 That always leads to a bigger one 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.160
 piece of pleasure in your work
