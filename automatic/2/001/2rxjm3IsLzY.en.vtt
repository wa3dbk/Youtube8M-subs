Center<00:02:20.300> as<00:02:20.420> well<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:20.810> since<00:02:21.020> we're<00:02:21.170> using<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
Center as well so since we're using a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.839 
Center as well so since we're using a
jig<00:02:21.680> saw<00:02:21.709> today<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.310> don't<00:02:22.459> want<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.670> have<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
jig saw today we don't want to have to

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.210 
jig saw today we don't want to have to
cut<00:02:23.060> two<00:02:23.330> individual<00:02:23.989> holes<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.890> instead

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
cut two individual holes so instead

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.800 
cut two individual holes so instead
we're<00:02:25.370> going<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.550> make<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.849> into<00:02:26.090> one<00:02:26.300> large

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
we're going to make this into one large

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.390 
we're going to make this into one large
hole<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.380> what<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.620> can<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.010> take<00:02:28.220> your

ctek grille installed and we when we

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.380 
ctek grille installed and we when we
overlay<00:03:35.159> this<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.640> can<00:03:35.790> see<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.150> there's<00:03:36.330> a

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
overlay this you can see that there's a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.660 
overlay this you can see that there's a
bit<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> overlap<00:03:37.260> with<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.739> case<00:03:37.980> underneath

the more square corners of this grille

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.770 
the more square corners of this grille
so<00:03:41.519> I'm<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.819> mark<00:03:41.970> those<00:03:42.209> off<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.720> then

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
so I'm going to mark those off and then

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.259 
so I'm going to mark those off and then
run<00:03:43.260> them<00:03:43.709> with<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.340> jigsaw<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.120> we<00:03:45.180> have

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
run them with the jigsaw just so we have

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.630 
run them with the jigsaw just so we have
a<00:03:45.330> nice<00:03:45.540> clean<00:03:46.019> look<00:03:46.260> underneath<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:50.430> next
