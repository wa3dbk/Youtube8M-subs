things um actually we now also have
redstone<00:02:29.310> blocks<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.940> what's<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> be

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
redstone blocks is what's going to be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
redstone blocks is what's going to be
added<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> game<00:02:31.140> yes<00:02:31.470> redstone<00:02:31.950> blocks

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
added in the game yes redstone blocks

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.650 
added in the game yes redstone blocks
are<00:02:32.400> really<00:02:32.670> cool<00:02:32.850> if<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.300> don't<00:02:33.390> know<00:02:33.570> what

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
are really cool if you don't know what

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.380 
are really cool if you don't know what
they<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.380> basically<00:02:35.040> they're<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
they are on basically they're like you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.990 
they are on basically they're like you
know<00:02:36.420> redstone<00:02:37.320> blocks<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.190> yet<00:02:38.550> they

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
know redstone blocks that out yet they

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850 
know redstone blocks that out yet they
can<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.270> used<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.540> redstone<00:02:40.020> i<00:02:40.230> guess<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:40.650> well

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
can be used as redstone i guess as well

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.310 
can be used as redstone i guess as well
so<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.460> don't<00:02:42.090> play<00:02:42.270> pc<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.960> i<00:02:42.990> don't<00:02:43.200> really

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
so I don't play pc so i don't really

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.870 
so I don't play pc so i don't really
know<00:02:43.440> too<00:02:44.010> much<00:02:44.040> about<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:46.160> Reds<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:47.550> about

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.820 
know too much about the Reds like about
the<00:02:48.000> pc<00:02:48.360> updates<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:48.900> whatever<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.290> yeah<00:02:49.500> all

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

the pc updates or whatever but yeah all
i<00:02:49.890> do<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.700> redstone<00:02:51.180> blocks<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:52.290> be

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
i do know that redstone blocks can be

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.580 
i do know that redstone blocks can be
used<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:52.950> know<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.060> much<00:02:54.140> well<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.440> can

used you know just as much well as I can

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
used you know just as much well as I can
guess<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> redstone<00:02:56.160> torch<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.940> something

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
guess a redstone torch or something

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.140 
guess a redstone torch or something
anyway<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.070> next<00:02:59.490> day<00:02:59.610> we're<00:02:59.880> going<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> be

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
anyway so the next day we're going to be

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.170 
anyway so the next day we're going to be
getting<00:03:00.420> into<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.440> daylight<00:03:02.070> sensors<00:03:02.670> yes

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
getting into is the daylight sensors yes

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.060 
getting into is the daylight sensors yes
stay<00:03:03.630> light<00:03:03.690> sensors<00:03:04.320> will<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.890> game

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
stay light sensors will be in the game

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.030 
stay light sensors will be in the game
and<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.310> guess<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.970> tells<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.630> all<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.260> think

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I guess that tells you all I think

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.360 
and I guess that tells you all I think
whatever<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:10.020> daytime<00:03:10.650> or<00:03:10.710> something

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
whatever it is like daytime or something

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.330 
whatever it is like daytime or something
light<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.910> don't<00:03:12.720> really<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:13.050> too<00:03:13.110> much<00:03:13.340> what

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
light I don't really know too much what

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.740 
light I don't really know too much what
they<00:03:14.490> hell<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:14.790> since<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.180> said<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.450> don't<00:03:15.540> play

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
they hell are since I said I don't play

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.600 
they hell are since I said I don't play
pc<00:03:16.140> by<00:03:16.290> pretty<00:03:16.590> sure<00:03:16.709> that's<00:03:16.920> what<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.459> it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
pc by pretty sure that's what is is it

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.550 
pc by pretty sure that's what is is it
it's<00:03:18.030> kind<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.510> clock<00:03:18.900> i'm<00:03:19.140> assuming

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's kind of like a clock i'm assuming

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's kind of like a clock i'm assuming
but<00:03:19.980> um<00:03:20.160> yeah<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.790> daylight<00:03:21.300> sensors<00:03:21.750> will<00:03:22.020> be

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
but um yeah so daylight sensors will be

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.670 
but um yeah so daylight sensors will be
in<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.650> game<00:03:22.920> as<00:03:23.190> well<00:03:23.580> um<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:25.050> uh<00:03:25.080> let's

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
in the game as well um and then uh let's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.199 
in the game as well um and then uh let's
see<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.010> next<00:03:26.040> thing<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.580> we<00:03:26.880> will<00:03:27.090> be

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
see the next thing that we will be

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.330 
see the next thing that we will be
having<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.660> hoppers<00:03:28.260> yes<00:03:28.740> we<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> be

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
having is hoppers yes we are going to be

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.400 
having is hoppers yes we are going to be
having<00:03:29.459> hoppers<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.810> believe<00:03:31.380> that

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
having hoppers and I believe that

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.140 
having hoppers and I believe that
hoppers<00:03:32.070> are<00:03:32.220> some<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.580> wear<00:03:32.730> whenever<00:03:33.060> you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
hoppers are some to wear whenever you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
hoppers are some to wear whenever you
throw<00:03:33.330> an<00:03:33.510> item<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.080> there<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:35.340> does<00:03:35.580> something

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
throw an item in there it does something

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.060 
throw an item in there it does something
i<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.840> don't<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.260> guys<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.620> have<00:03:37.950> to

i really don't know guys you have to
look<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.580> stuff<00:03:38.880> i<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.959> probably<00:03:40.350> should

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
look up this stuff i I probably should

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.560 
look up this stuff i I probably should
have<00:03:40.590> come<00:03:40.860> prepared<00:03:41.239> knowing<00:03:42.239> all<00:03:42.390> this

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
have come prepared knowing all this

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.210 
have come prepared knowing all this
stuff<00:03:42.810> before<00:03:42.959> i<00:03:43.200> started<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> video<00:03:43.920> but

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
stuff before i started the video but

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.140 
stuff before i started the video but
yeah<00:03:44.489> um<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.500> anyway<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.890> hoppers<00:03:47.400> will<00:03:47.580> also<00:03:47.970> be

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
yeah um so anyway a hoppers will also be

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.710 
yeah um so anyway a hoppers will also be
inside<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.930> game<00:03:49.170> as<00:03:49.380> well<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.820> next<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
inside the game as well and so next the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.540 
inside the game as well and so next the
next<00:03:52.110> thing<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.530> was<00:03:52.650> also<00:03:52.890> going<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.280> be<00:03:53.370> in

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
next thing I was also going to be in

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.270 
next thing I was also going to be in
here<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.000> finally<00:03:54.750> beacons<00:03:55.380> yes<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.130> going

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
here is finally beacons yes we are going

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.430 
here is finally beacons yes we are going
to<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.430> having<00:03:56.580> beacons<00:03:57.180> inside<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> old

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
to be having beacons inside of the old

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.820 
to be having beacons inside of the old
game<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.280> Minecraft<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.480> beacon<00:04:01.110> can<00:04:01.650> be

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
game of Minecraft and so a beacon can be

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.610 
game of Minecraft and so a beacon can be
really<00:04:02.070> good<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.520> basically<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.510> if<00:04:04.350> you're

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
really good to basically a if you're

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.490 
really good to basically a if you're
like<00:04:04.800> loss<00:04:05.190> i<00:04:05.459> guess<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> house

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
like loss i guess and you have a house

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.320 
like loss i guess and you have a house
you<00:04:07.830> can<00:04:07.980> build<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.250> beacon<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.700> top<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.120> your

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
you can build a beacon on top of your

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.180 
you can build a beacon on top of your
house<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.350> can<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.770> it<00:04:10.860> from<00:04:10.920> like<00:04:11.160> a

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
house and you can see it from like a

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.770 
house and you can see it from like a
mile<00:04:11.550> away<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.239> just<00:04:12.390> look<00:04:12.480> up<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
mile away you can just look up in the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.199 
mile away you can just look up in the
sky<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.470> see<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.190> beacon<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:14.880> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
sky and you can see the beacon so that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.570 
sky and you can see the beacon so that
way<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.690> wherever<00:04:16.169> you're<00:04:17.160> wanting<00:04:17.520> to

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
way you know wherever you're wanting to

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.460 
way you know wherever you're wanting to
go<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.239> there<00:04:18.479> that's<00:04:18.930> where<00:04:19.140> it's<00:04:19.260> at<00:04:19.410> so

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
go to is there that's where it's at so

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.950 
go to is there that's where it's at so
um<00:04:20.010> yeah<00:04:20.760> that's<00:04:20.970> going<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.270> be<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.479> there<00:04:21.690> us

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
um yeah that's going to be in there us

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.290 
um yeah that's going to be in there us
and<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.919> think<00:04:23.130> beacons<00:04:23.760> might<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.120> able

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and I think beacons might be able

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.719 
and I think beacons might be able
do<00:04:24.419> something<00:04:24.780> else<00:04:24.990> out<00:04:25.289> remember<00:04:25.729> unless

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
do something else out remember unless

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.510 
do something else out remember unless
it's<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.050> but<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.710> wine<00:04:29.009> I<00:04:29.039> just<00:04:29.370> make<00:04:29.490> a

it's just it but a wine I just make a
crafting<00:04:29.970> table<00:04:30.030> after<00:04:30.479> I<00:04:30.659> already<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.169> a
