00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.490
 you who knows the styles 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.990
 different styles of wrestling who 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.149
 Mexicans could have an advantage 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.630
 those of the us the japanese are rest of the 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.519
 world 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.009
 Well look, I think the Japanese is 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.070
 well prepared those guys from 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.350
 children are inside a gym no 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.470
 practicing wrestling practicing everything 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.300
 type of sport karate giucich surf 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.480
 determined sport that end in the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.449
 interschool school and they already choose 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.290
 what sport are you going to dedicate to being 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.750
 profession when they are great but there 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.140
 it's very important that you have to do sports 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.360
 to all the secretariats that have in 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 the office and everything have a schedule for 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.190
 go out to do sports for 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.860
 de-stress for them they say so that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.559
 render more the element and here we 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.460
 sport as we set aside a 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.559
 profession 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.260
 1 they take them as a hobby but there is a lot 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.760
 people who do not really play sports and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.470
 I believe that to render 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.879
 we have to be active we have to 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.070
 be good 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 sportingly prepared your opinion to 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.600
 regarding international teams 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.000
 from the USA and the rest the world 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.310
 good the opinion is that if they come and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.890
 come well prepared I think they are going to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.890
 give the big battle here in mexico and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 here Mexicans have to give more 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 of one hundred percent of what they are 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.790
 used to give to show us 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.370
 as they said it's not about it being a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.229
 company but the fighters are the ones 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.050
 they have to here do not take into account 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.180
 rudo or technicians and is what was done in 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.970
 bullfighting I could fight a day earlier 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.460
 with a thousand masks the next day I had 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.990
 than going up with him and as a Mexican 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.540
 go up to defend the flag of mexico 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.490
 not the flag that I am rude and you 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.009
 you are 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.990
 I'm going to show you that if we were there 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.350
 because we were the best at that time 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.689
 and because we have always been the best 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.700
 and particularly the legends will be 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.220
 very well represented by the teacher 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.280
 solar, I do not think solar has 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.509
 is very well prepared and well to see 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 what can i say 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.550
 wagner is from the school of us nothing 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.700
 but it has become a little loose I 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.450
 found the situation more this then 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.030
 more glamor of more this over there 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.180
 that is wrestling but I think that 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.060
 if he gets right into what he knows 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.830
 what he learned because in his house he had 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.750
 teachers 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.960
 the teacher who teaches you is no longer the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.460
 same as you have here and I think it is 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.180
 one of the best disciples I've ever 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.760
 had 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.530
 the doctor wagner finally some team 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.270
 favorite that this test can you 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.340
 forecast good I give you for about 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.680
 children who have to stay in Mexico 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.320
 you have to be Mexican in the team that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.790
 win but it depends on the preparation the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.460
 Japanese are too hard and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.920
 difficult and then if they come more 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.020
 prepared that the Mexican although I 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.540
 I have preferred to tell you how Mexican is going 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.700
 to earn mexico that wins with pride 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.800
 because he earned it and because they have the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.610
 knowledge and the necessary condition 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.610
 to do it
