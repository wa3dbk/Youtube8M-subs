like<00:00:58.390> full<00:00:59.020> court<00:00:59.379> I<00:00:59.559> think<00:00:59.860> full<00:01:00.040> court<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.460> a

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
like full court I think full court is a

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
like full court I think full court is a
really<00:01:00.910> cool<00:01:01.120> improvement<00:01:01.780> nothing<00:01:02.590> like<00:01:03.430> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
really cool improvement nothing like a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.170 
really cool improvement nothing like a
real<00:01:04.809> crew<00:01:05.229> but<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.160> mean<00:01:06.430> definitely<00:01:06.700> isn't

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
real crew but I mean definitely isn't

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.040

and<00:01:13.000> all<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.360> but<00:01:13.860> yeah<00:01:14.860> 5v5<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.670> definitely

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
and all that but yeah 5v5 is definitely

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.749 
and all that but yeah 5v5 is definitely
an<00:01:16.209> improvement<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:17.050> give<00:01:17.530> 2k<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.310> lot<00:01:18.670> of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
five on five this year but I do think

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.570 
five on five this year but I do think
that<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.660> next-gen<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.160> is<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.280> bold

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
that a next-gen and this is a bold

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.820 
that a next-gen and this is a bold
prediction<00:01:28.060> but<00:01:28.270> i<00:01:28.479> do<00:01:28.840> think<00:01:29.020> next-gen

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
prediction but i do think next-gen

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.699 
prediction but i do think next-gen
they're<00:01:30.039> gonna<00:01:30.130> bring<00:01:30.369> back<00:01:30.610> real<00:01:30.910> crew<00:01:31.240> and

it on my channel to the 2k trailer for
NBA<00:01:39.789> 2k14<00:01:40.209> um<00:01:41.429> next<00:01:42.429> gen<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.880> was<00:01:43.440> ridiculous

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
NBA 2k14 um next gen it was ridiculous

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.270 
NBA 2k14 um next gen it was ridiculous
so<00:01:45.039> I<00:01:45.429> mean<00:01:46.360> if<00:01:46.539> they<00:01:46.869> didn't<00:01:47.289> add<00:01:47.470> anything

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
so I mean if they didn't add anything

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.779 
so I mean if they didn't add anything
new<00:01:48.780> into<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.959> game<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.860> really<00:01:51.369> wouldn't<00:01:51.670> be

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
new into the game I really wouldn't be

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.710 
new into the game I really wouldn't be
that<00:01:52.000> upset<00:01:52.149> because<00:01:53.670> 2k<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.849> showing<00:01:55.330> that

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
that upset because 2k is showing that
