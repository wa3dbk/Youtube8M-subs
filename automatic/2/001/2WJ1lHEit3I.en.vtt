00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
in spots where they can score in that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.370

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
them opportunities for easy baskets are

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.750 
them opportunities for easy baskets are
having<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.540> because<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:51.290> make<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.400> defense

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
having it because I make the defense

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.260 
having it because I make the defense
peso<00:00:53.410> no<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:54.650> we<00:00:54.800> get<00:00:54.980> some<00:00:55.520> good<00:00:55.970> players

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
peso no there we get some good players

peso no there we get some good players
who<00:00:56.510> understand<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.050> game<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.500> think<00:00:57.860> it'll

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
who understand the game I think it'll

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.340 
who understand the game I think it'll
come<00:00:58.700> together<00:00:58.850> nicely<00:00:59.180> anything<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.140> didn't

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
come together nicely anything you didn't

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.460 
come together nicely anything you didn't
like<00:01:02.650> I'll<00:01:03.650> keep<00:01:03.860> that<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.160> myself<00:01:05.470> nothing

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
like I'll keep that to myself nothing

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.020 
like I'll keep that to myself nothing
that<00:01:06.620> basketball<00:01:07.100> terms<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.610> know<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:07.760> mean<00:01:07.940> I

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
that basketball terms you know I mean I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.730 
that basketball terms you know I mean I
think<00:01:08.650> like<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.740> second<00:01:10.130> soon<00:01:11.500> six<00:01:12.500> days<00:01:12.680> ago

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
think like a second soon six days ago

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.109 
think like a second soon six days ago
whatever<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:15.250> we<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.460> caught<00:01:16.640> up<00:01:16.729> assam

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
whatever it is we get caught up assam

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.560 
whatever it is we get caught up assam
great<00:01:18.369> we've<00:01:19.369> seen<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:19.729> past<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.390> could

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
great we've seen this past we could

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.020 
great we've seen this past we could
train<00:01:20.780> him<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.200> just<00:01:21.380> helped<00:01:22.030> plant

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
train him that just helped plant

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.820 
train him that just helped plant
foundation<00:01:23.660> for<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.930> chemistry<00:01:24.470> between<00:01:26.830> let

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
foundation for the chemistry between let

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.710 
foundation for the chemistry between let
me<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.130> spend<00:01:28.580> time<00:01:28.700> with<00:01:28.850> alyssa<00:01:29.210> that's

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
me just spend time with alyssa that's

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.120 
me just spend time with alyssa that's
the<00:01:29.900> bottom<00:01:30.200> line<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:30.500> have<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.710> spend<00:01:30.950> some

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the bottom line you have to spend some

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.320 
the bottom line you have to spend some
of<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.340> court<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.640> get<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.030> sort<00:01:32.300> of

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
of the court to get in a sort of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.410 
of the court to get in a sort of
chemistry<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:32.990> i<00:01:33.020> think<00:01:33.229> i<00:01:34.000> could<00:01:35.000> practice

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
chemistry so i think i could practice

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.090 
chemistry so i think i could practice
delta<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.290> we<00:01:36.410> had<00:01:36.530> somewhat<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:36.920> a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
delta so we had somewhat of a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
delta so we had somewhat of a
familiarity<00:01:37.520> go<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:38.030> there

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
familiarity go out there

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.210 
familiarity go out there
we're<00:01:39.690> able<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we're able to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
we're able to
find<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:41.940> cohesion<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:43.320> thought<00:01:43.800> both<00:01:44.010> ends

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
find some cohesion I thought both ends

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
find some cohesion I thought both ends
before<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.610> did<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.760> pretty<00:01:45.030> decent<00:01:45.210> job

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
before we did a pretty decent job

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
before we did a pretty decent job
playing<00:01:45.960> together<00:01:46.080> micron<00:01:46.980> just<00:01:47.190> told<00:01:47.310> us<00:01:47.400> no

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
playing together micron just told us no

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.610 
playing together micron just told us no
practice<00:01:48.120> are<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> gonna<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.260> with<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> day

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
practice are you gonna do with the day

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.110 
practice are you gonna do with the day
off<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.980> haven't<00:01:50.160> had<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.460> yet<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:53.120> what'd

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
off you haven't had one yet right what'd

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.750 
off you haven't had one yet right what'd
you<00:01:54.150> say<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.510> wanna<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:55.410> he's<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.650> chemistry<00:01:56.580> of

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
you say you wanna go he's a chemistry of

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.180 
you say you wanna go he's a chemistry of
the<00:01:57.330> tongue<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:58.200> pretty<00:01:58.380> good
