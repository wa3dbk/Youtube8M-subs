00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello everyone today we will do 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 cream sauce for meat 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.389
 the sauce is very tasty I like it very much 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 and I'll show you now how his children are for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.030
 this we will need 250 grams either 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.049
 sour cream either in half with me on earth she 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.960
 and for can and less 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.300
 In this case, I have sour cream 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.859
 mayonnaise 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.859
 if you have something against mayonnaise 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 do it only with sour cream 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 2 cloves garlic two tablespoons 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 soy sauce and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 1 pickled cucumber but I have a big 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 cucumber was not so I took a few 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 pieces of little cucumbers and so we 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:49.469
 do to start small-cut 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 cucumbers and mushrooms that's how I rub on a grater on 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 fine grater just turns out 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.539
 faster and the taste is not at all 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.539
 suffers 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:40.539
 connecting together with sour cream probably 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 there will be a small pot extruded 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.259
 here 2 cloves of garlic 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 more we record it yum like this and yet i 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.700
 forgot to tell us we need greens 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.750
 will need 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.510
 dill and parsley unfortunately here is dill 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.310
 I did not have 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.580
 the store is already closed so i dill not 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:47.830
 I will lay down and put the cock on the remote 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:50.640
 I also chop finely too 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.640
 add here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.840
 pour in two tablespoons of soy sauce 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.220
 printing and flax mix 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.310
 better to take a bigger pot 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:38.769
 what was more convenient to stir it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.769
 chic meat sauce 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:56.790
 We do not give us a little insistence somewhere with 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:58.659
 half an hour and even served on the table 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.430
 we shift the jar and put 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:06.280
 the refrigerator and when it is necessary we smear on 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:19.289
 meat something like this we smear and 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:19.289
 try very important recommend bye bye
