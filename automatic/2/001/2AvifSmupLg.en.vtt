00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.500
 good so here we have both 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.059
 next uconn smartphones so the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 miami and is the new york 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.830
 the miami is a 4.7 phone 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.000
 inch qhd resolution with a device 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.760
 8 megapixel photo like new york 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 state the two the difference in big 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 between the two is already the size of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 the screen this one new york and 5.3 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.090
 for 4.7 for miami and battery 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.200
 dock of 2800 for 2000 for miami 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.660
 so already we have brought to light 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 as you see, it's pretty pretty 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 when you've cooked you'll actually see 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.770
 here you can go directly so 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 either on the phone or on the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 messages are on the camera 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 either just unlock 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.850
 so it's pretty well thought it's 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.620
 rather pretty the wallpapers will be 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 different for the final version 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 since there are still versions 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.899
 test so the same if there are any bugs 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 is totally normal 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 both phones will have the pope 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.560
 thinks rather a good thing with 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 current offers 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.140
 that's where we even see the 6- watt boxes 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.240
 who will be official this is not 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.640
 keys pretty much official in any case the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.580
 two smartphones ship a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.290
 quad core processor from qualcomm 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.729
 with also a front camera of 2 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.829
 megapixels for the second step of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.560
 foolery 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.729
 the two finally I'll talk about the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.670
 every time from russell because the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.810
 two otherwise it's pretty much the same thing 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.759
 the two giga storage surveys 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 internally with a gig of rome for that 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.579
 I could say other countries 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.799
 are dual sim 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 that's what's interesting when we 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.649
 travel a lot so I'm going 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.200
 unlock to show you a little 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.770
 little fluidity of the phone so I 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.030
 want to redo one of the locks and so 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.149
 it's really very very fluid ins and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.710
 of body weight so really after 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.909
 a nice little school like 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.879
 you can see it's already a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.820
 transparency is pretty good and the 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.980
 call the keys pretty big 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.600
 so that's really learned at the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.500
 Facebook contacts sync 6 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.420
 May with with existing contacts the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.830
 messages so this is the interface of 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.640
 messages to android classic because 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.290
 that there is no overlay yet 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.140
 really good phone for the price 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 who announced less than 200 euros for the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.390
 new york so the one that I have in the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 hand so 5.3 inches and about 170 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.230
 euros for miami who is here who is 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.880
 of 4.7 inches both are really 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 very light we really do not 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.140
 the impression of really holding a 5.3 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 inches there for example in the hands I 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.500
 could really do me because there 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.600
 I go from a 4-5-1 5,3 and there it takes 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.050
 in mine for phone phone 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.470
 current 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.500
 so it's really hungry pleasant in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.490
 hand it's really what light 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 what else could I say 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.720
 the camera is really more than 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.020
 correct for this price range there 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.450
 it's not no it's not 13 megapixels 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.330
 as current but really already there is 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.580
 autofocus there is a led flash which is 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.140
 right here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.890
 after you have all the parameters of 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.459
 basic android customization that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.900
 see the reduction of red eyes 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.910
 Face Detection for example I 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.910
 take a picture club of the box 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.440
 as you can see it's always 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.959
 very fluid really nothing to complain about is 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
 really very good smartphone for this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.200
 price range there I think for 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.050
 the moment I have not yet tested better 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.100
 so this moment very good for the sequel and 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:57.010
 yukon there will be no software that 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.170
 will be extra that will be installed 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.810
 basic apart from finally the software of 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.360
 at google since they have so finally 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.080
 normal widgets as you can 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.320
 see now 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.550
 here is a good ride there there is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.230
 no wifi so I will not be able to go 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.760
 on the internet but I can tell you that 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.680
 it's really very fluid ago 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.680
 really a problem that's
