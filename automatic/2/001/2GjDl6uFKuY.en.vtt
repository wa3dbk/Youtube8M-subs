00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.509
 adel at 26 by winning his license 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 six months ago he thinks he's done the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.480
 harder but he was not imagining to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.130
 how hard they would find 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 an insurance for his renault twingo of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.599
 2006 because adel has a defect he is young 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.619
 and therefore has no experience 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.510
 the day I got my license 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.539
 including two assurances that was 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 pretty well known and I believe was not answering 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.570
 their criteria 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 timothée 24 years for him either it did not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 not been easy to ensure his old 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.030
 mercedes car of 1989 still a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.219
 little difficult to make sure I imagined 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 blow I galley a little 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 timothée was able to solve his problem in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.969
 using a broker 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.950
 specialized insurance in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.110
 novice drivers his premium has gone 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.809
 from 2000 euros to 1600 euros to tourists 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.180
 400 euros of savings as for adel 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 he was not discouraged on the internet 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.840
 he found an insurance comparator 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.520
 a system that selects quotes from 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.199
 several companies and offers the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.270
 best deals for that allows for good 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.060
 judge in fact between the guarantees and the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.130
 price is to save money 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.190
 often we have on average an economy of 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.800
 121 euros 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.910
 by roccat actually had the key 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.550
 access more comprehensive coverage 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.280
 and especially more affordable subscribes a 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.090
 comprehensive insurance in my budget 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.470
 that you are 2250 euros and the others 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.030
 insurance offered me expensive but 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.200
 why these young drivers doubt it 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.630
 had so much trouble finding insurance 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.090
 to del and timothy are part of these 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.440
 rather unloved profiles of insurers there 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.730
 there are profiles of insured who pay more 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.470
 expensive than the others for example the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.150
 young because we presented a 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.280
 very strong accidentology 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 unfortunately for young people it's 9 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.050
 % of the population but it's still 20 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.480
 % of those killed on the road but young 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.730
 are not the only seniors and 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.630
 producers at bono malus buzz also the 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.050
 price of their insurance premiums 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 increase by about 30% on average when 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.790
 we know that civil liability 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.000
 automobile is compulsory since 1957 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.570
 this is not without problem here 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.920
 doris and bernard 64 and 75 years old for 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.750
 to pay the price of their insurance 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.480
 they chose a mileage formula 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.409
 limited much cheaper 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.849
 girl could not have retired for 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.760
 take insurance per kilometer 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.830
 he gives an extremely low rate 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.250
 competitive with optimal coverage 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.069
 since we are insured against all risks without 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.650
 franchise doris and bernard peille 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.940
 today 850 euros a year if he had 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.540
 chose an all-risk cover 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.170
 conventional 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.180
 he should have paid 1200 euros if the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.769
 insurers rewards the experience of 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.900
 drivers by lowering their premiums 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.670
 insurance thanks to the bonus with age 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.530
 the risks increase just as the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.540
 senior prices we know that today 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.099
 between 60 and 70 years ago + 11% 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 accidents for this population in 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.420
 plus the other coulter and beyond 80 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 years 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.739
 fares tend to fly away with 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.069
 surprises that can reach 45% 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.000
 he faced me with problems of 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.799
 audiovisual perception quality the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.500
 reflexes etc which actually do that 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.180
 there from 80 years ago there is more 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.919
 accidents that cost more is 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.480
 unfortunately the case of stone that is 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.160
 suffers a double penalty is 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.590
 only he is 82 years old 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.079
 but in addition he suffers a penalty of 40% 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.239
 consecutive to two accidents responsible 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.720
 result his insurer terminated his 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.819
 contract 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.600
 that's where I was confirmed 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.390
 could not reassure me anymore but 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.000
 he did not leave without resources 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.950
 since it's him who told me 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.980
 another specialized insurance in the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.350
 drivers with heavy accidents 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.760
 frequent to ensure its citroën c3 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.500
 picasso pierre had no other choice 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.970
 to go to a brokerage firm 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.890
 is specialized in risks 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.980
 aggravated and we try to find 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.140
 for our customer the best guarantee 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.640
 in a difficult situation or sometimes 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.620
 can not find insurance in the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.640
 traditional companies at the best 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.770
 price because it's important 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.740
 it's not because these people are 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.350
 in trouble that it takes that insurance 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.170
 an additional charge in their 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.760
 goal the 3840 euros per year all risks 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.800
 that's what stone has to pay for 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.820
 power today continues to roll it 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.390
 do not lose hope 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.340
 my insurer guaranteed me 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.390
 in would resume in the same 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.210
 conditions if in two years I have nothing 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.669
 a 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.860
 important to insure his vehicle 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.199
 when you are a senior or a bad guy 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.449
 is certainly difficult and expensive is not 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.110
 impossible because even in case of refusal 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.699
 categorical 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.620
 as a last resort there is a 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.860
 state agency that can help you 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.020
 the central charging office not a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.830
 little mysterious maybe to a mission 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.240
 very clear it has a role of setting the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.030
 bet an insurance premium for to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.460
 our glee live patrol insurers and 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.759
 the btp sets the average premium in 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.070
 which company will be held 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.349
 cover the risk that has been proposed to him 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.060
 bct's intervention is free 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.380
 so there is no reason to take 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.380
 the risk of rolling uninsured
