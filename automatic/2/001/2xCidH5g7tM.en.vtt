obvious here so this piece here is going

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.000 
obvious here so this piece here is going
to<00:00:28.430> mesh<00:00:28.730> in<00:00:29.060> with<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.320> there's<00:00:30.980> a

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
to mesh in with that and there's a

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.970 
to mesh in with that and there's a
couple<00:00:31.130> other<00:00:31.279> spots<00:00:32.380> that<00:00:33.380> there<00:00:33.620> is<00:00:33.800> going

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
couple other spots that there is going

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340 
couple other spots that there is going
to<00:00:34.040> go<00:00:34.160> on<00:00:34.340> here<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:34.970> hand<00:00:35.360> sticks<00:00:36.079> on<00:00:36.230> the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
to go on here this hand sticks on the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.650 
to go on here this hand sticks on the
bottom<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.860> arm<00:00:37.100> head<00:00:37.940> obviously<00:00:38.270> goes

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
bottom of that arm head obviously goes

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.870 
bottom of that arm head obviously goes
in<00:00:38.840> there<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.190> all<00:00:40.340> goes<00:00:40.520> on<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.700> base

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
in there and it's all goes on the base

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.950 
in there and it's all goes on the base
so<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.300> all<00:00:41.420> fits<00:00:41.450> together<00:00:41.750> in<00:00:42.200> only<00:00:42.590> one<00:00:42.980> way

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
so it all fits together in only one way

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.200 
so it all fits together in only one way
but<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.079> not<00:00:45.290> snap<00:00:45.649> fit<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.790> other<00:00:46.910> thing<00:00:47.120> to

but it's not snap fit the other thing to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.080 
but it's not snap fit the other thing to
note<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.570> this<00:00:48.020> sprue<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.219> same<00:00:49.430> size<00:00:49.670> as

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
note is this sprue is the same size as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.360

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
nice kind of a detail and as soon as I

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.339 
nice kind of a detail and as soon as I
saw<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:24.970> knew<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.239> was<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.420> plastic<00:02:25.750> model

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
saw this I knew this was a plastic model

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.720 
saw this I knew this was a plastic model
because<00:02:26.799> I've<00:02:26.860> never<00:02:26.920> seen<00:02:27.220> anything<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.610> it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
because I've never seen anything on it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.559 
because I've never seen anything on it
with<00:02:27.819> metal<00:02:28.269> with<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.599> kind<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.989> smoke

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
with metal with that kind of a smoke

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
there okay so now we clip all the bits

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.559 
there okay so now we clip all the bits
off<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.500> there's<00:02:51.280> my<00:02:51.459> pile<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.819> bits<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.209> have

off and there's my pile of bits I have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.319 
off and there's my pile of bits I have
to<00:02:52.690> clean<00:02:52.900> some<00:02:53.139> of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.400> sprue<00:02:54.400> lines<00:02:54.909> and

to clean some of the sprue lines and
there<00:02:55.540> are<00:02:55.720> spewed<00:02:56.109> lines<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:56.650> it's<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
there are spewed lines on this it's the

there are spewed lines on this it's the
word<00:02:57.489> on<00:02:57.609> mine<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.480> along<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.019> edge<00:02:59.109> of<00:02:59.139> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
word on mine so along the edge of the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250 
word on mine so along the edge of the
plasma<00:02:59.500> gun<00:02:59.920> along<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.000> edge<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.389> cruiser

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260

kano along the side of the head and then
a<00:03:06.849> long<00:03:07.090> sea<00:03:07.780> along<00:03:08.049> this<00:03:08.230> edge<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.709> wasn't<00:03:09.069> too

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
a long sea along this edge it wasn't too

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.610 
a long sea along this edge it wasn't too
bad<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.760> bottom<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> bit<00:03:10.450> worse<00:03:10.599> a<00:03:10.900> little

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
bad the bottom was a bit worse a little

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.679 
bad the bottom was a bit worse a little
bit<00:03:11.709> along<00:03:11.950> there<00:03:12.189> and<00:03:12.400> then<00:03:12.909> all<00:03:13.180> along<00:03:13.540> this

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
bit along there and then all along this

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.210 
bit along there and then all along this
detail<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> little<00:03:14.260> bit<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.680> screw<00:03:14.980> lines

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
detail a little bit of screw lines

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.559 
detail a little bit of screw lines
nothing<00:03:16.180> too<00:03:16.599> crazy<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:19.000> not<00:03:19.120> perfect

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
nothing too crazy but just not perfect

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.780 
nothing too crazy but just not perfect
okay<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.769> we're<00:03:21.190> getting<00:03:21.310> ready<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.579> glue

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
okay so we're getting ready to glue

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.280 
okay so we're getting ready to glue
together<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.299> we're<00:03:22.449> going<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.629> put<00:03:22.720> glue<00:03:22.989> all

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
together so we're going to put glue all

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.039 
together so we're going to put glue all
along<00:03:23.949> this<00:03:24.190> surface<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.019> squish<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
along this surface and squish it

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.839 
along this surface and squish it
together<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.310> can<00:03:27.370> see<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> bit<00:03:27.609> of<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
together here you can see a bit of the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.569 
together here you can see a bit of the
screw<00:03:28.090> line<00:03:28.269> there<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.379> if<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.650> nicely<00:03:29.859> I<00:03:30.250> use

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
screw line there so if it's nicely I use

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.449 
screw line there so if it's nicely I use
a<00:03:30.609> Tamiya<00:03:31.650> extra<00:03:32.650> thin<00:03:32.829> glue<00:03:33.069> which<00:03:33.280> is

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
a Tamiya extra thin glue which is

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.930 
a Tamiya extra thin glue which is
similar<00:03:33.669> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> GW<00:03:34.750> thin<00:03:35.560> glue<00:03:35.889> although<00:03:36.879> I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
similar to the GW thin glue although I

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.390 
similar to the GW thin glue although I
like<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> applicator<00:03:37.690> better<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.799> little<00:03:39.280> bit

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
like the applicator better a little bit

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.219 
like the applicator better a little bit
of<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.549> gap<00:03:39.760> here<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:40.449> probably<00:03:40.930> should<00:03:41.199> be

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:41.229 
of a gap here that probably should be

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.349 
of a gap here that probably should be
filled<00:03:41.560> before<00:03:41.799> painting<00:03:42.220> otherwise<00:03:43.030> that's

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
filled before painting otherwise that's

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.270 
filled before painting otherwise that's
probably<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.810> only<00:03:43.840> gap<00:03:44.409> that<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.769> noticed<00:03:45.190> on

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
probably the only gap that I noticed on

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.869 
probably the only gap that I noticed on
the<00:03:45.340> model<00:03:45.729> after<00:03:45.970> assembling<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:47.699> look<00:03:48.699> at<00:03:48.790> it

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
the model after assembling it look at it

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.309 
the model after assembling it look at it
side<00:03:49.060> there<00:03:49.239> i<00:03:49.269> think<00:03:49.599> i<00:03:49.659> missed<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.019> bit<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.229> the

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
side there i think i missed a bit of the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.080 
side there i think i missed a bit of the
sprue<00:03:50.620> line<00:03:50.829> but<00:03:51.129> i<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.430> probably<00:03:51.729> the<00:03:51.909> skies

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
sprue line but i can probably the skies

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.659 
sprue line but i can probably the skies
at<00:03:52.329> with<00:03:52.449> paint<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:52.810> i<00:03:53.349> paint<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.769> glutton<00:03:54.159> the

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
at with paint so i paint a glutton the

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.539 
at with paint so i paint a glutton the
plasma<00:03:55.510> pistol<00:03:55.870> arm<00:03:56.290> there<00:03:56.709> there's<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.370> little

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
plasma pistol arm there there's a little

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.219 
plasma pistol arm there there's a little
bit<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.819> leeway<00:03:58.060> which<00:03:58.389> way<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.599> can<00:03:58.780> twist<00:03:59.019> it

00:03:59.219 --> 00:03:59.229 
bit of leeway which way you can twist it

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:00.869 
bit of leeway which way you can twist it
that<00:03:59.500> basically<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.430> going<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:00.669> look<00:04:00.849> like

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
that basically is going to look like

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.280 
that basically is going to look like
that<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:03.090> then<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.269> glue<00:04:04.479> on<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.629> one<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.049> fits

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
that and then I glue on this one it fits

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.839 
that and then I glue on this one it fits
really<00:04:05.650> snuggly<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.400> just<00:04:06.519> got<00:04:06.609> to<00:04:06.639> make<00:04:06.790> sure

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
really snuggly you just got to make sure

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.729 
really snuggly you just got to make sure
that<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:07.299> get<00:04:07.419> this<00:04:07.569> all<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.959> mesh<00:04:08.169> up<00:04:08.409> right

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
that you get this all the mesh up right

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.099 
that you get this all the mesh up right
in<00:04:08.769> there<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.989> yeah<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.079> looks<00:04:11.260> quite<00:04:11.769> nice<00:04:13.109> so

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
in there and yeah it looks quite nice so

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.110 
in there and yeah it looks quite nice so
in<00:04:14.169> the<00:04:14.229> back<00:04:14.379> side<00:04:14.650> there<00:04:14.889> it<00:04:15.010> all<00:04:15.129> fits<00:04:15.940> in

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
in the back side there it all fits in

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.050 
in the back side there it all fits in
just<00:04:16.150> perfect<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.609> glue<00:04:18.609> in<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.820> head<00:04:18.940> and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
just perfect and glue in the head and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.550 
just perfect and glue in the head and
that's<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.870> know<00:04:19.959> I'm<00:04:20.169> glue<00:04:20.349> them<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.529> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that's it you know I'm glue them to the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.950 
that's it you know I'm glue them to the
base<00:04:20.739> obviously<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:21.760> that's<00:04:22.270> that's<00:04:22.779> all

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
base obviously so that's that's all

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.089 
base obviously so that's that's all
there<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:23.469> guy<00:04:23.680> pretty

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
there is to this guy pretty

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.879 
there is to this guy pretty
straightforward<00:04:24.370> assembly

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
straightforward assembly

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.439 
straightforward assembly
and<00:04:26.219> there's<00:04:26.699> just<00:04:26.849> a<00:04:26.939> bit<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.240> size

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
and there's just a bit of a size

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.890 
and there's just a bit of a size
comparison<00:04:28.400> there's<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.460> better<00:04:29.639> one<00:04:29.819> so<00:04:30.419> yeah

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
comparison there's a better one so yeah

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.989 
comparison there's a better one so yeah
obviously<00:04:31.199> compared<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:31.949> terminator<00:04:32.729> a

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:32.999 
obviously compared to a terminator a

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.290 
obviously compared to a terminator a
little<00:04:33.749> bit<00:04:33.900> smaller<00:04:34.289> but<00:04:35.120> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> look

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
little bit smaller but going to look

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.510 
little bit smaller but going to look
really<00:04:36.479> nice<00:04:36.719> in<00:04:36.779> the<00:04:36.960> table<00:04:37.080> top<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.620> you<00:04:38.490> can

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
really nice in the table top and you can

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.640 
really nice in the table top and you can
check<00:04:38.759> out<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:39.029> video<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:40.050> I<00:04:40.080> did<00:04:40.199> for<00:04:40.529> that

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
check out the video that I did for that

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.580 
check out the video that I did for that
painting<00:04:41.029> on<00:04:42.029> my<00:04:42.449> youtube<00:04:42.810> channel<00:04:42.840> or<00:04:43.349> my

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
painting on my youtube channel or my

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.909 
painting on my youtube channel or my
blog<00:04:44.270> okay<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.330> let's<00:04:45.840> walk<00:04:46.020> around<00:04:46.050> here<00:04:46.529> all

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
blog okay so let's walk around here all

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.839 
blog okay so let's walk around here all
the<00:04:47.039> assembled<00:04:47.249> guys<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.909> just<00:04:47.969> spin<00:04:48.779> around

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
the assembled guys so just spin around

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.369 
the assembled guys so just spin around
so<00:04:50.849> yeah<00:04:50.999> lots<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.509> lots<00:04:51.629> of<00:04:51.779> detail<00:04:52.050> almost

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
so yeah lots and lots of detail almost

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.510 
so yeah lots and lots of detail almost
every<00:04:52.620> surface<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:53.069> think<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.310> only<00:04:53.340> thing

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
every surface I think the only thing

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.249 
every surface I think the only thing
that<00:04:53.759> doesn't<00:04:53.909> have<00:04:54.150> tons<00:04:54.509> of<00:04:54.599> detail<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
that doesn't have tons of detail is the

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.709 
that doesn't have tons of detail is the
cloak<00:04:55.469> and<00:04:55.819> it<00:04:56.819> kind<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.180> should<00:04:57.360> flame

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
cloak and it kind of should flame

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.749 
cloak and it kind of should flame
obviously<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.800> could<00:04:58.949> paint<00:04:59.099> some<00:04:59.370> patterns

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
obviously you could paint some patterns

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.719 
obviously you could paint some patterns
on<00:04:59.939> there<00:05:00.090> if<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:00.270> wanted<00:05:00.599> but<00:05:01.590> yeah<00:05:02.430> really

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
on there if you wanted but yeah really

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.809 
on there if you wanted but yeah really
impressive<00:05:03.330> goes<00:05:03.810> together<00:05:04.050> like<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.469> charm

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
impressive goes together like a charm

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.959 
impressive goes together like a charm
but<00:05:05.819> you<00:05:05.939> do<00:05:06.120> have<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.509> glue<00:05:06.689> it<00:05:07.699> so<00:05:08.699> i'll<00:05:08.849> be

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
but you do have to glue it so i'll be

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.640 
but you do have to glue it so i'll be
doing<00:05:09.090> more<00:05:09.360> videos<00:05:09.419> for<00:05:09.900> dark<00:05:10.080> vengeance<00:05:10.289> i

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
probably be the preferable way just a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.540 
probably be the preferable way just a
bit<00:05:24.419> easier<00:05:24.689> for<00:05:24.719> me<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.930> handle<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.379> but<00:05:25.889> by

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
bit easier for me to handle that but by

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.850 
bit easier for me to handle that but by
