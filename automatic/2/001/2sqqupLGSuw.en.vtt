00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.139
 hey serena remember that news that 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.780
 according to crash I was going to return if I still 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.840
 I remember but that was two months ago 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.009
 nobody talks about that well, I think it 's 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.009
 time to talk about it 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.020
 well as a fan of crash bandicoot no 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.599
 I could pass this crash theme 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.610
 come back this question was asked during 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.890
 several weeks after seeing that in a 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.350
 trailer from playstation to crush in a 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 transit signal this seen by the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.400
 fans was a sign that they are and has 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.830
 new to crush and is about to get a new 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.110
 game for play 4 plus that in the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.450
 page of amazon france was published a 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.820
 crash game for sale for play 4 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.280
 before its release of this console 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.680
 this page is known for publishing 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.660
 games before your departure as we can 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.000
 see on the cover craft has a new 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.309
 design which many liked and 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 to put this even better if we go to the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 activision page and we look for crash 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
 bandicoot we will not find anything what 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.860
 suggests that crash returned with 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.050
 naughty dog all this seems to be 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.060
 too good to be true and so 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.060
 the truth is that things are not like that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.170
 if we activate the annotations in the video 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.450
 of the trailer we can see a message that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.330
 says you can find the 50 eggs of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 Easter do the test what you gave me 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 understand that it is not so important 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.320
 as it was believed when you do the test and 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.860
 click on crash you will get this poster 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.979
 memory of playstation crash bandicoot 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.740
 wow 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.960
 this heroic marsupial is a legend of 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.420
 playstation but with the evil doctor 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.780
 neocortex on his heels crush 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.340
 he's always getting in trouble 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.590
 this at the same time is good since they are and not 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 he has forgotten it and they even call it legend 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.300
 we can also see in another video of 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.369
 playstation where they show how it was done 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.670
 the trailer and there you can see better the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.670
 signal 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.520
 as we can see on the cover the design 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 is drawn what seems to me to be 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320
 be a fan art and if we look to one side 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.050
 there is a message that says it is not art 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 final another thing that you can see is that 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.060
 the logo of the game is exactly the same 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.610
 to the first crush will be some kind of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.550
 tribute or maybe it's not something 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.550
 official I do not know but it seems strange 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.950
 after a few months the publication of 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.349
 amazon was eliminated by a demand for 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.720
 zombie zombie said that they still did not have 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.340
 planned to take out a game of crush what 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.159
 reaffirms what I said about the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 cover was a fan also because 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.420
 they assumed that crush would come back with 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.280
 naughty dog we know well that activision 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.230
 It's full of money and I do not think 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.209
 they would like to sell to crush besides that 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.909
 naughty dog ​​has other games in mind 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.400
 but there is a more notebook news soon 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.110
 will celebrate its 30th anniversary where they 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.930
 they said that maybe they would get one 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.900
 surprise will be that that surprise is crush 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.940
 I really would not have any illusions 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.459
 that always end in disappointments but 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.530
 we'll see what happens later another 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.170
 thing I found out about is that they are 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.780
 wants to replace crush with nac but 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 because they want to replace it if they can 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.790
 come back with crush to do this 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.629
 It makes me angry a little but I hope the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.629
 things for back 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.860
 years ago several images came out 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.260
 about new games but they are only 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.150
 fun arts but what is true is the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.190
 variety of games canceled crash 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.500
 in recent years 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.750
 a few years ago a video came out showing 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.540
 a canceled crash game that would come out 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.150
 in 2010 this would have many new things 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.190
 in addition to a new design to crash the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.220
 which reminds me a lot of your version 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.880
 Japanese this game would go for ps3 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.090
 xbox 360 and wii but it was canceled without reason 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.070
 Something that can be noticed is that 5 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.560
 of leh had an important role in the 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.100
 game would also have version for 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.100
 nintendo ds 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.090
 another game that goes with it is cristian 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.520
 racing 2 this would be a version 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.139
 modern dps one would have many 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.960
 characters and new powers and 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.870
 skills for karts at the moment 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.840
 only four characters were confirmed 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.570
 polar crash 5 delay a shark but for 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.410
 Stupid reasons canceled the game 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.770
 this game would come out for ps3 xbox 360 and 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.770
 wii link 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.940
 finally in 2013 also the internet 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.310
 went around after seeing that in a picture of 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.530
 study of vicarious visions a poster 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.470
 behind with another design but for bad it was 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.600
 a poster of a game canceled or 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.730
 even in all starz butler or already 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.590
 it came crash and believe me he deserved 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.870
 be there but no track 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.540
 marsupial only images were made 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.820
 false last the e3 of this year 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.890
 after everything seen by sonny he 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.470
 I thought that crush would make its appearance in 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.960
 his conference but unfortunately it was not 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.290
 well the marsupial was not named nor a 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.190
 what makes me think that 2014 is not 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.190
 it's the year of crack 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.670
 so long without a new crash game 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.530
 makes it impossible to see a new game but 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.450
 while your true fans keep 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.550
 remembering what crash will live in our 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.370
 memories and we can only hope 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.190
 maybe in 2014 we do not have a new 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.620
 game but chance and in 2015 we have 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.200
 new crash news what's important 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.040
 is not to lose hope good friends 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.350
 that was all 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 It's been a while since I posted a video 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.300
 I will try to upload something at least in 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.020
 these days, good, I say goodbye, take care 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.020
 until next time
