it's that size and it does add a bit to
it<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.850> super

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it but it doesn't really get super

it but it doesn't really get super
top-heavy<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.540> have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
top-heavy which I like and then we have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.590 
top-heavy which I like and then we have
the<00:01:48.780> section<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.470> interesting<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the section very interesting it has the

fully hooded they have the section which

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130 
fully hooded they have the section which
is<00:02:01.469> nice<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.399> smooth<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.030> put<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.990> one

about<00:03:56.700> 40<00:03:57.300> grams<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:58.050> heavy<00:03:58.200> one<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.440> got

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
about 40 grams it's a heavy one I got

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.910 
about 40 grams it's a heavy one I got
feeling<00:03:59.100> it's<00:03:59.250> it's<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.610> metal<00:03:59.970> body<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.920> I

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
feeling it's it's a metal body and I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.270 
feeling it's it's a metal body and I
would<00:04:02.070> be<00:04:02.190> fast<00:04:02.420> could<00:04:03.420> find<00:04:03.660> my<00:04:03.780> calipers

and<00:04:25.350> that's<00:04:25.500> all<00:04:25.680> that's<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.980> it<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.190> don't

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
and that's all that's to it I don't

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.470 
and that's all that's to it I don't
think<00:04:26.520> there's<00:04:26.640> much<00:04:26.820> more<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.120> say<00:04:27.330> about

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
think there's much more to say about

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.180 
think there's much more to say about
this<00:04:27.720> pen<00:04:27.990> apart<00:04:28.470> from<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> fact<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.010> it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
this pen apart from the fact that it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.620 
this pen apart from the fact that it
looks<00:04:29.400> looks<00:04:29.970> interesting<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:33.120> didn't

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
looks looks interesting but I didn't

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.720 
looks looks interesting but I didn't
think<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.870> design<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.560> everyone<00:04:34.920> so<00:04:35.130> I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
think this design is for everyone so I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.100 
think this design is for everyone so I
would<00:04:35.970> very<00:04:36.090> much<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.510> see<00:04:36.750> those<00:04:36.900> old

Schaefer script black came in the

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
cartridge that came with the pen so I'm

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.000 
cartridge that came with the pen so I'm
just<00:05:12.360> gonna<00:05:12.480> write<00:05:12.720> down<00:05:12.750> Schaefer<00:05:13.470> black<00:05:16.010> the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
just gonna write down Schaefer black the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:31.490 
just gonna write down Schaefer black the
nib<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.580> would<00:05:18.390> say<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.750> a<00:05:18.780> fine

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.020 

I'm<00:05:32.500> going<00:05:32.680> fairly<00:05:33.010> fast<00:05:33.310> there<00:05:33.580> should

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
I'm going fairly fast there should

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.930 
I'm going fairly fast there should
probably<00:05:34.210> slow<00:05:34.990> down<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.230> bit

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
probably slow down a bit

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.400 
probably slow down a bit
I'll<00:05:36.940> do<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.150> fast<00:05:37.420> writing<00:05:37.870> sample<00:05:38.290> right

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
I'll do the fast writing sample right

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:49.560 
I'll do the fast writing sample right
now<00:05:47.100> what<00:05:48.100> you<00:05:48.220> see<00:05:48.430> is<00:05:48.700> that<00:05:49.000> there<00:05:49.270> are<00:05:49.360> some

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
now what you see is that there are some

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.000 
now what you see is that there are some
skips<00:05:49.990> on<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.290> upstrokes

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
skips on the upstrokes

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.300 
skips on the upstrokes
um<00:05:52.170> overall<00:05:53.170> I<00:05:53.230> find<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.680> Pam<00:05:53.920> not<00:05:54.130> the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
um overall I find the Pam not the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.060 
um overall I find the Pam not the
wettest<00:05:54.790> and<00:05:55.180> it's<00:05:55.990> not<00:05:56.200> terrible<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:56.830> course

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
wettest and it's not terrible of course

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.010 
wettest and it's not terrible of course
that's<00:05:57.220> also<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.520> property<00:05:57.760> of<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.150> images<00:05:58.900> of

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
that's also a property of the images of

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.350 
that's also a property of the images of
the<00:05:59.140> nib<00:05:59.380> but<00:05:59.620> I<00:06:00.280> personally<00:06:00.670> enjoy<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.060> bit

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
the nib but I personally enjoy a bit

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.180 
the nib but I personally enjoy a bit
more<00:06:01.540> flow<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:01.900> don't<00:06:02.230> find<00:06:02.440> this<00:06:02.590> extremely

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
more flow I don't find this extremely

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.940 
more flow I don't find this extremely

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
wet on the Rodya paper it is that's not

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.560 
wet on the Rodya paper it is that's not
the<00:06:06.100> most<00:06:06.250> absorbent<00:06:06.610> paper<00:06:06.940> in<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.240> world<00:06:07.330> so

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
the most absorbent paper in the world so

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.720 
the most absorbent paper in the world so
it<00:06:07.690> seems<00:06:08.020> a<00:06:08.200> bit<00:06:08.380> wetter<00:06:08.590> when<00:06:09.430> if<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.610> use

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
it seems a bit wetter when if you use

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.820 
it seems a bit wetter when if you use
this<00:06:09.910> in<00:06:09.970> Cheaper<00:06:10.420> paper<00:06:10.630> then<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.020> found<00:06:11.590> the

this in Cheaper paper then I found the

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.520 
this in Cheaper paper then I found the

variation<00:06:20.460> you<00:06:21.460> can't<00:06:21.700> squeeze<00:06:22.000> a<00:06:22.060> little<00:06:22.419> bit

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
variation you can't squeeze a little bit

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.350 
variation you can't squeeze a little bit
out<00:06:22.750> but<00:06:22.930> it's<00:06:23.200> really<00:06:23.290> not<00:06:23.680> pronounced

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
out but it's really not pronounced

out but it's really not pronounced
reverse<00:06:25.360> writing<00:06:26.280> you<00:06:27.280> see<00:06:27.520> again<00:06:27.760> the<00:06:27.940> nib<00:06:28.120> is

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
reverse writing you see again the nib is

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.570 
reverse writing you see again the nib is
fairly<00:06:28.570> dry<00:06:28.930> he<00:06:29.710> doesn't<00:06:29.950> really<00:06:30.070> like<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.460> do

fairly dry he doesn't really like to do

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.710 
fairly dry he doesn't really like to do
that<00:06:30.820> it<00:06:30.940> runs<00:06:31.090> dry<00:06:31.450> and<00:06:31.480> it<00:06:31.870> skips<00:06:33.330> so<00:06:34.330> in<00:06:34.540> all

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
that it runs dry and it skips so in all

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.580 
that it runs dry and it skips so in all
it's<00:06:34.990> a<00:06:35.110> fascinating<00:06:35.350> pen<00:06:36.010> and<00:06:37.080> I'm<00:06:38.080> sure<00:06:38.410> that

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
it's a fascinating pen and I'm sure that

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.440
