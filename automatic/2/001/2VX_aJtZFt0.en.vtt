00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690 

this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:00.960> binary<00:00:01.230> clock<00:00:01.650> built<00:00:02.100> using<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this is a binary clock built using the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.720 
this is a binary clock built using the
Arduino<00:00:03.179> lilypad<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.650> tell<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.980> time<00:00:05.190> by

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
Arduino lilypad and you tell the time by

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.340 
Arduino lilypad and you tell the time by
adding<00:00:06.029> up<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> numbers<00:00:06.600> next<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
adding up the numbers next to the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.250 
adding up the numbers next to the
illuminated<00:00:07.919> LEDs<00:00:08.540> so<00:00:09.540> let's<00:00:09.719> freeze<00:00:09.960> time

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
illuminated LEDs so let's freeze time

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160 
illuminated LEDs so let's freeze time
for<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> moment<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> Ana's<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.570> 2<00:00:12.719> plus<00:00:12.960> 1

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
for a moment the Ana's are 2 plus 1

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
for a moment the Ana's are 2 plus 1
which<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.500> 3<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.519> minutes<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.910> 16<00:00:15.240> plus<00:00:15.450> 8

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
which is 3 and the minutes of 16 plus 8

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
which is 3 and the minutes of 16 plus 8
plus<00:00:15.690> 2<00:00:16.109> plus<00:00:16.350> 1<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.100> 27<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.920> seconds

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
plus 2 plus 1 which is 27 the seconds

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390 
plus 2 plus 1 which is 27 the seconds
are<00:00:20.520> 16<00:00:20.910> plus<00:00:21.180> 4<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> 20<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> time<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
are 16 plus 4 which is 20 so the time is

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
are 16 plus 4 which is 20 so the time is
3<00:00:23.670> 27<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.630> 20<00:00:25.590> seconds<00:00:26.930> let's<00:00:27.930> start<00:00:28.199> time

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
3 27 and 20 seconds let's start time

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
3 27 and 20 seconds let's start time
again<00:00:32.059> one<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> nice<00:00:33.390> things<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
again one of the nice things about the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470 
again one of the nice things about the
lily<00:00:34.380> pad<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.370> flat<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.329> we've

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
lily pad is that it's very flat so we've

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
lily pad is that it's very flat so we've
mounted<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.930> entire<00:00:37.380> thing<00:00:37.770> inside<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
mounted the entire thing inside a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.150 
mounted the entire thing inside a
regular<00:00:38.790> picture<00:00:39.149> frame<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> project<00:00:43.950> does

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
regular picture frame the project does

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
regular picture frame the project does
draw<00:00:44.430> quite<00:00:44.670> amounts<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> power<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.170> not

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
draw quite amounts of power so it's not

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
draw quite amounts of power so it's not
driven<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.680> batteries<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.610> rather<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
driven by batteries but rather there's a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.940 
driven by batteries but rather there's a
lead<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.230> connects<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
lead at the back that connects to a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.180 
lead at the back that connects to a
power<00:00:50.250> adapter

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.520 

there<00:00:57.940> are<00:00:58.059> no<00:00:58.180> switches<00:00:58.660> at<00:00:58.780> all<00:00:58.989> on<00:00:59.230> this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
there are no switches at all on this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.979 
there are no switches at all on this
project<00:00:59.769> at<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.910> way<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.269> set<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.719> time

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
project at the way that you set the time

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.189 
project at the way that you set the time
is<00:01:02.289> by<00:01:02.680> introducing<00:01:03.190> our<00:01:03.670> magnet<00:01:04.059> over<00:01:04.960> the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
is by introducing our magnet over the

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.410 
is by introducing our magnet over the
little<00:01:05.500> reed<00:01:05.740> switch<00:01:06.040> which<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.119> that

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
little reed switch which is in that

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.440 
little reed switch which is in that
circle<00:01:08.049> next<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.070> plus<00:01:09.340> plus<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.850> when

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
circle next to the plus plus and when

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.080 
circle next to the plus plus and when
you<00:01:10.600> activate<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.470> reed<00:01:11.710> switch<00:01:12.090> time

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
you activate that reed switch time

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.060 
you activate that reed switch time
travels<00:01:13.479> much<00:01:13.630> faster<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.710> just<00:01:14.890> let<00:01:15.040> it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
travels much faster and you just let it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.550 
travels much faster and you just let it
whiz<00:01:15.340> round<00:01:15.580> until<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.210> gets<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:17.259> correct

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
whiz round until it gets to the correct

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.880 
whiz round until it gets to the correct
time

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.499 

with<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:21.920> bit<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.130> care<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.820> can<00:01:23.000> just<00:01:23.180> nudge

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
with a bit of care you can just nudge

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.539 
with a bit of care you can just nudge
all<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> time<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.530> exactly<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.100> right<00:01:25.220> time

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
all the time to exactly the right time

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.360 
all the time to exactly the right time
by<00:01:26.299> using<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.930> reed<00:01:27.080> switch
