you unlock the lock screen in a very

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.400 
you unlock the lock screen in a very
different<00:00:05.069> way<00:00:05.190> you<00:00:05.520> sign<00:00:05.960> to<00:00:06.960> unlock<00:00:07.290> the

different way you sign to unlock the
device<00:00:07.500> unlike<00:00:08.429> other<00:00:08.550> devices<00:00:08.880> where<00:00:09.150> you

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
device unlike other devices where you

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.150 
device unlike other devices where you
have<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> very<00:00:09.840> typical<00:00:10.050> unlock<00:00:10.530> sequence<00:00:10.950> here

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
have a very typical unlock sequence here

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.860 
have a very typical unlock sequence here
you<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> unlock<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.150> signing<00:00:12.480> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you just have to unlock by signing and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.049 
you just have to unlock by signing and
when<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> sign<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.460> find<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.030> are

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
when you sign in you find that you are

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.260 
when you sign in you find that you are
on<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.299> grid<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.379> grid<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.580> home<00:00:17.730> screen

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
on a grid the grid is your home screen

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.810 
on a grid the grid is your home screen
it's<00:00:18.810> an<00:00:18.930> endless<00:00:19.199> space<00:00:19.609> where<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> can

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820

it's an endless space where you can
throw<00:00:21.090> around<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.480> half

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
throw around your half

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
throw around your half
the<00:00:22.080> way<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.430> move<00:00:23.550> very

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the way you want it I can move very

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450 
the way you want it I can move very
quickly<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.380> pan<00:00:25.560> around<00:00:25.740> slowly<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
quickly I can just pan around slowly the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000 
quickly I can just pan around slowly the
way<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.930> different<00:00:28.289> clusters

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
way I want the different clusters

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
way I want the different clusters
that's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> media<00:00:29.760> cluster<00:00:30.150> that's<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> music

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
that's a media cluster that's a music

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's a media cluster that's a music
cluster<00:00:31.140> clusters<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.219> folders<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
cluster clusters are like folders you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
cluster clusters are like folders you
organize<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.320> keep<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
organize it you keep it the way you like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
organize it you keep it the way you like
it<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> don't<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> page<00:00:36.719> anymore

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it so you don't have to page anymore

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.600 
it so you don't have to page anymore
like<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> iPhone<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
like you do with the iPhone or the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
like you do with the iPhone or the
Android<00:00:38.700> devices<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.200> endless

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
Android devices now you have an endless

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
Android devices now you have an endless
greed<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.790> organize<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:42.270> F<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
greed and you can organize your F the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.209 
greed and you can organize your F the
way<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> want<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:46.070> collapse<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
way you want it I can also collapse a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.470 
way you want it I can also collapse a
cluster<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.440> can<00:00:49.440> also<00:00:49.590> expand<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> cluster<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
cluster I can also expand a cluster so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
cluster I can also expand a cluster so
that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> smaller<00:00:53.100> grid<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that you can have a smaller grid if you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
that you can have a smaller grid if you
like<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.149> if<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:54.570> keep<00:00:54.719> collapsing<00:00:55.230> in

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
like I'm just if i keep collapsing in

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.160 
like I'm just if i keep collapsing in
you'll<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.100> able<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.640> grid<00:00:56.850> clearer

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
you'll be able to see your grid clearer

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
you'll be able to see your grid clearer
but<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.320> i<00:00:58.379> expand<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.399> show<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> all

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
but if i expand it you will show you all

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
but if i expand it you will show you all
the<00:01:00.149> folders<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.199> apps<00:01:01.379> within<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the folders all the apps within that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
the folders all the apps within that
cluster<00:01:02.460> itself<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> notice<00:01:04.680> right

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
cluster itself and if you notice right

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.500 
cluster itself and if you notice right
here<00:01:04.920> there's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> grid<00:01:05.519> map<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.119> grid<00:01:06.330> map

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
here there's a grid map the grid map

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.030 
here there's a grid map the grid map
tells<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> exactly<00:01:07.020> where<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.619> where<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
tells you exactly where you where you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.039 
tells you exactly where you where you
want<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> grid<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.330> pan<00:01:09.510> around<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
want the grid so i could pan around and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.530 
want the grid so i could pan around and
get<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.740> quickly<00:01:11.040> i<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.240> snap

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
get there very quickly i can just snap

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870 
get there very quickly i can just snap
and<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:13.650> tap<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:14.460> i<00:01:14.520> want<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> get

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and just tap to get where i want to get

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.440 
and just tap to get where i want to get
to<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.090> wrong

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
to is wrong

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.929 
to is wrong
so<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:15.930> could<00:01:16.170> pan<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:17.070> using<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.430> fingers<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so i could pan by using my fingers and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
so i could pan by using my fingers and
scan<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> home<00:01:19.530> screen<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:20.040> i<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.549> use

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
scan around the home screen or i can use

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.190 
scan around the home screen or i can use
the<00:01:20.820> grid<00:01:20.970> map<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.720> i<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the grid map to get to where i want to

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
the grid map to get to where i want to
or<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.830> tap<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.000> very

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
or just tap to get that very very

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.380 
or just tap to get that very very
quickly<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> let's<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
quickly so let's just see how we want to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
quickly so let's just see how we want to
organize<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.259> clusters<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.490> grid<00:01:29.759> we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
organize the clusters on the grid we

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
organize the clusters on the grid we
have<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> call<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> clusters<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
have what we call the clusters so if you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.380 
have what we call the clusters so if you
look<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> grid<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.790> find<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> media

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
look at the grid you find a media

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.719 
look at the grid you find a media
cluster<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.259> find<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> music<00:01:34.770> cluster<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
cluster you find a music cluster all of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
cluster you find a music cluster all of
this<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.390> folders<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.990> can

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this are like your folders I can

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.880 
this are like your folders I can
collapse<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> folders<00:01:40.320> closed<00:01:40.619> or

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
collapse to get the folders closed or

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.460 
collapse to get the folders closed or
the<00:01:41.040> classes<00:01:41.340> closed<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.299> expand<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.990> have

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the classes closed I can expand to have

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.280 
the classes closed I can expand to have
the<00:01:43.649> classes<00:01:43.950> expanded<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.390> close

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the classes expanded and when you close

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
the classes expanded and when you close
the<00:01:46.380> cluster<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.009> push<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.610> allow

the cluster you will push it and allow

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
the cluster you will push it and allow
it<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> space<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.590> see

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it to get to space so that you can see

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.330 
it to get to space so that you can see
your<00:01:49.890> grid<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> clearer<00:01:50.970> fashion<00:01:52.220> if<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
your grid in a clearer fashion if I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.710 
your grid in a clearer fashion if I
wanted<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> organize<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.240> unopen<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
wanted to organize it or unopen the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
wanted to organize it or unopen the
cluster<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
cluster I can do just that and this is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.130 
cluster I can do just that and this is
exactly<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> wanted

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
exactly what I just did and if I wanted

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
exactly what I just did and if I wanted
to<00:01:58.200> change<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.710> background<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.729> on

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to change my background I just have on

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
to change my background I just have on
the<00:01:59.909> grid<00:02:00.060> map<00:02:00.259> change<00:02:01.259> background<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.920> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the grid map change background and there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.709 
the grid map change background and there
will<00:02:02.759> allow<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.060> change<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> background

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
will allow me to change the background

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
will allow me to change the background
that<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.340> case<00:02:05.610> I'm<00:02:05.850> going

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that I like and in this case I'm going

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.650 
that I like and in this case I'm going
to<00:02:06.060> choose<00:02:07.910> let's<00:02:08.910> let<00:02:09.149> me<00:02:09.239> choose<00:02:09.450> another

background<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.640> apply<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
background here I just apply that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110

my<00:02:12.959> background<00:02:13.290> has<00:02:13.319> changed<00:02:13.549> I'm<00:02:14.549> panning

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
my background has changed I'm panning

my background has changed I'm panning
the<00:02:15.209> grid<00:02:15.420> again<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.870> did<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.230> even

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
the grid again like I did and even

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.380 
the grid again like I did and even
notice<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.920> background<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> grid<00:02:17.760> has<00:02:18.360> a

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
notice the background of the grid has a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
notice the background of the grid has a
perspective<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.409> so<00:02:19.620> he<00:02:19.709> feels<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.069> life

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
perspective to it so he feels a life

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.789 
perspective to it so he feels a life
rather<00:02:20.939> than<00:02:21.150> being<00:02:21.299> static<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.500> wanted<00:02:22.739> to

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
rather than being static if I wanted to

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.740 
rather than being static if I wanted to
organize<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.400> clusters<00:02:23.879> organize<00:02:24.269> my<00:02:24.420> apps<00:02:24.599> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
organize my clusters organize my apps I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.199 
organize my clusters organize my apps I
can<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.170> very<00:02:25.230> easily<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.670> step<00:02:26.939> on

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
can do that very easily I just step on

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.440 
can do that very easily I just step on
the<00:02:27.269> organizer<00:02:28.200> again<00:02:28.700> click<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.819> edit<00:02:30.150> grid

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the organizer again click on edit grid

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.429 
the organizer again click on edit grid
and<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:32.220> fresh<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.700> whole<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:33.629> move<00:02:33.870> an<00:02:34.019> app<00:02:34.200> out

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
and I fresh the whole to move an app out

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.800 
and I fresh the whole to move an app out
of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> cluster<00:02:35.189> when<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.790> move<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.599> an

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
of the cluster when I move it out to an

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.619 
of the cluster when I move it out to an
empty<00:02:36.989> space<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.430> become<00:02:38.760> an<00:02:38.970> app<00:02:39.420> by

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
empty space that will become an app by

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.830 
empty space that will become an app by
itself<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.890> move<00:02:41.189> another<00:02:41.489> one<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.659> it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
itself if I move another one and get it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.750 
itself if I move another one and get it
together<00:02:43.049> with<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.530> previous<00:02:43.829> one<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.280> will

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
together with the previous one that will

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000 
together with the previous one that will
create<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.030> cluster<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.650> case<00:02:46.859> I'm

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
create a cluster and in this case I'm

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.190 
create a cluster and in this case I'm
just<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.459> call<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.909> cluster<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.629> didn't

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
just going to call the cluster I didn't

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.390 
just going to call the cluster I didn't
want<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.379> create<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.620> class<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.010> forget

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
want to create a class that I forget

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.729 
want to create a class that I forget
that<00:02:50.639> I<00:02:50.819> basically<00:02:51.599> move<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.989> if<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.500> want<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
that I basically move on if I want to

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.890 
that I basically move on if I want to
move<00:02:52.829> this<00:02:53.129> one<00:02:53.340> instead<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.599> do<00:02:54.720> that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
move this one instead I can do that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.099 
move this one instead I can do that
present<00:02:55.799> all<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:57.450> helps<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> create<00:02:57.930> a

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
present all that helps to create a

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.599 
present all that helps to create a
called<00:02:58.260> another<00:02:58.349> cluster<00:02:58.920> again<00:02:59.310> because<00:02:59.519> I'm

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
called another cluster again because I'm

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.429 
called another cluster again because I'm
pairing<00:02:59.939> it<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.569> let's<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.019> leave<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.349> as

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
pairing it and let's just leave it as

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.879 
pairing it and let's just leave it as
group<00:03:01.680> for<00:03:01.920> now<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.370> say<00:03:02.849> done<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.230> that

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
group for now and say done so and that

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.770 
group for now and say done so and that
creates<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.189> new<00:03:05.340> cluster<00:03:05.549> call<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.299> group<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
creates a new cluster call the group and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.319 
creates a new cluster call the group and
if<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:07.409> done<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.859> just<00:03:07.889> apply<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:09.000> fixes

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
if I'm done I just apply and that fixes

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.229 
if I'm done I just apply and that fixes
the<00:03:09.599> changes<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.139> need<00:03:10.879> so<00:03:11.879> let's<00:03:12.090> click
