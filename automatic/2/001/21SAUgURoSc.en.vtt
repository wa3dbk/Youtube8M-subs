00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
some more information on that so look at

some more information on that so look at
the<00:00:46.380> hi-hat<00:00:46.710> patterns<00:00:47.130> here<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.030> first

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the hi-hat patterns here the first

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
the hi-hat patterns here the first
hi-hat<00:00:49.020> pattern<00:00:49.380> is<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.579> pattern

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
hi-hat pattern is right this pattern

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
hi-hat pattern is right this pattern
from<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> first<00:00:54.900> packet<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.190> second

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
from the first packet and the second

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
from the first packet and the second
pattern<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> first<00:00:58.290> packet

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pattern is also from the first packet

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.550 
pattern is also from the first packet
right<00:00:59.070> left<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.759> this<00:01:06.540> packet<00:01:07.049> does<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
right left so what this packet does is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.099 
right left so what this packet does is
it<00:01:07.710> combines<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.939> patterns<00:01:09.719> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.899> hand

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
it combines the patterns of the hand

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:12.260 
it combines the patterns of the hand
patterns<00:01:10.469> and<00:01:10.679> grooves<00:01:10.950> along<00:01:11.759> with<00:01:12.030> its

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
patterns and grooves along with its

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.989 
patterns and grooves along with its
sixteenth<00:01:13.079> note<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.740> straight<00:01:14.310> sixteenth<00:01:14.759> note

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
sixteenth note a straight sixteenth note

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.489 
sixteenth note a straight sixteenth note
I<00:01:15.299> guess<00:01:15.889> beat<00:01:17.600> sibling<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.780> guess<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> could

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
I guess beat sibling I guess you could

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.440 
I guess beat sibling I guess you could
say<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:19.889> you<00:01:20.459> say<00:01:20.579> it's<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.999> one<00:01:21.179> thing<00:01:21.329> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
say that you say it's it's one thing to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.389 
say that you say it's it's one thing to
be<00:01:21.539> able<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.719> play<00:01:21.929> a<00:01:21.959> pattern<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> over

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
be able to play a pattern over and over

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.219 
be able to play a pattern over and over
by<00:01:23.700> itself<00:01:24.090> alright<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.719> if<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.899> look<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.139> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
by itself alright so if I look at the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
by itself alright so if I look at the
second<00:01:25.560> measure<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.950> number<00:01:26.219> one<00:01:32.090> that's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
second measure of number one that's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.599 
second measure of number one that's
great<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.840> building<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.319> coordination<00:01:34.889> but

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
great I'm building that coordination but

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.419 
great I'm building that coordination but
you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.569> a<00:01:36.600> lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> songs<00:01:37.109> just<00:01:38.039> play

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
you know not a lot of songs just play

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.609 
you know not a lot of songs just play
one<00:01:38.700> beat<00:01:38.999> over<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> over<00:01:39.899> you<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.529> be

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
one beat over and over you have to be

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.249 
one beat over and over you have to be
able<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.799> transition<00:01:41.329> so<00:01:42.329> whether<00:01:43.049> that's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
able to transition so whether that's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.559 
able to transition so whether that's
transitioning<00:01:43.979> through<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.279> drum<00:01:44.670> fill<00:01:44.969> or

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
transitioning through a drum fill or

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.359 
transitioning through a drum fill or
transitioning<00:01:46.319> to<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> different<00:01:47.039> part<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.279> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
transitioning to a different part of the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.099 
transitioning to a different part of the
music<00:01:47.849> there<00:01:48.359> are<00:01:48.450> different<00:01:48.719> beats<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
music there are different beats and

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.139 
music there are different beats and
there<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.319> different<00:01:49.590> things<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.889> play<00:01:50.099> so<00:01:50.670> by

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
there are different things to play so by

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.599 
there are different things to play so by
doing<00:01:51.209> this<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.319> number<00:01:52.529> one<00:01:52.709> takes<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.399> same

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
doing this so number one takes the same

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.359 
doing this so number one takes the same
bass<00:01:53.880> pattern<00:01:54.389> and<00:01:54.599> snare<00:01:55.020> pattern<00:01:55.289> but<00:01:56.189> play

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
bass pattern and snare pattern but play

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.580 
bass pattern and snare pattern but play
straight<00:01:56.639> sixteenths<00:01:57.179> on<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.389> hi-hat<00:01:57.590> by

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
straight sixteenths on the hi-hat by

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.319 
straight sixteenths on the hi-hat by
switching<00:01:59.099> back<00:01:59.279> and<00:01:59.340> forth<00:01:59.579> between<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
switching back and forth between this

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.919 
switching back and forth between this
you<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.459> to<00:02:02.459> develop<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:03.389> not<00:02:03.749> only

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
you really have to develop the not only

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.599 
you really have to develop the not only
the<00:02:04.049> coordination<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.219> mental

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
the coordination but the the mental

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.480 
the coordination but the the mental
ability<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.659> switch<00:02:07.079> between<00:02:07.109> them<00:02:07.889> so<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.250> let

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
ability to switch between them so me let

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.589 
ability to switch between them so me let
me<00:02:08.550> show<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.910> mean<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.270> that

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
me show you what I mean by that

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:24.950 
me show you what I mean by that
so<00:02:09.869> number<00:02:10.110> one

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:42.060 

I'll<00:02:25.960> play<00:02:26.200> beat<00:02:26.410> number<00:02:26.740> two<00:02:36.630> number<00:02:37.630> two<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
I'll play beat number two number two the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:03:02.820 
I'll play beat number two number two the
of<00:02:42.520> two<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.180> then<00:03:00.360> beat<00:03:01.360> number<00:03:01.660> three<00:03:01.960> mixes

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
of two and then beat number three mixes

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
the coordination but the ability to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.900 
the coordination but the ability to
switch<00:03:46.630> back<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.110> forth<00:03:47.350> between<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.040> two<00:03:48.220> so

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910
