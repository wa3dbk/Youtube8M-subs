00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.140
 tells crowd beauty all good too to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
 the video here 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.360
 This time making what is going 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 improve the speed of your windows 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 improve your fps in games if you have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.170
 load it from the processor 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 if you do not have I do not know if it improves 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 but I think it will improve 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.340
 if in the beginning the faster will be 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.199
 faster will be much better in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.949
 some matches and it will seem more 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.619
 slow but no it will be faster 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.930
 is it will reduce the bottleneck 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.120
 processor with will decrease the tasks 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.120
 that your processor runs on windows 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.940
 so everything has a good side and a side 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.500
 bad is the bad side is that it will not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.949
 change your system 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 It looks up to the internet and I do not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.680
 works more 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.860
 or you have to find his process in the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 internet or you open it all again in the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 facebook is then what you are going 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 Do you go here at your start in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:21.119
 said ms config 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 you come here services puts here looks 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.700
 maybe on your pc or you'll get more 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.299
 names or less 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 if you have nvidia leaves enabled 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.079
 if you have any appeal other than the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.600
 microsoft you leave motivated too 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.350
 here I put it to stay in order 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 alphabetically I disabled a lot of 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.960
 unused windows service 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.960
 I'll pass the list here to you. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.610
 you will have to disable these 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.820
 services here 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:04.770
 places an alphabetical order in the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 installation for all eye 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.360

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.680
 chases network pooling to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.140
 offline files 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.290
 backup windows white x central

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 windows configuration where the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.719
 remote work 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.939
 You 're going to be deactivating the features. 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:33.870
 so if you're going to use this, here lets 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.790
 logically enabled in the shadow cup 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.540
 all this crap that does not 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.109
 You use to nothing there to me, it has improved too much. 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.219
 Improved I do not know but fps improvements 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.129
 service detection and improve 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.150
 loading speed in game 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.340

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.269
 printer 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.549
 this is all to disable the rest you 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.150
 have to leave it active because it can stop 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.250
 to work and the sbt internet 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.359
 I took the majority there that I found 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.239
 It was futile that I found and management 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.579
 Account Manager application 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.430
 and in your Hindus you do not have 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.760
 this here you jump next because 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.459
 some have more of the same time 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.310
 windows time is still running 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.959

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:46.909
 Look what you need, I do not know this better. 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.489

 the home group provider publication 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:07.040
 I think this is in the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.780
 active file sharing here 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.530
 publication of discovery resources 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.599
 Function 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.190
 You'll have to apply and then 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.979
 nobody right server disable the service 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.660

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.910
 whether or not to use the history service 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.740
 backup engine service files 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.290

 windows service support button 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.430
 button still working 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.070
 I do not know, I did not test honey, so I use 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.290
 you use an active service declare 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.450
 virtual and parent of one of the times you go 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.670
 to use that keyboard condones with mice 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.920
 not only if you were my quoted you did not 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.800
 have a sin but this is very 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.090
 difficult to achieve the goal too 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.870
 work virtualization services 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.250
 remote services of the lush piedenso 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.850
 service is a device resident 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.190
 portable service hit the layer of 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.900
 windows defender service app 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.690
 remote desktop service 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.340
 windows explorer color service from 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.850
 with the dashboard bracket. 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.820
 control in new river too, that 's all 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.420
 which starts with windows and also 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:36.070
 that works on windows phone and everything 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:38.530
 What are you doing on Skype? 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:44.140
 and I think this can also leave you 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:49.840
 deactivates themes tester jeans from 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:53.530
 windows 7 instrumentation and windows 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.540
 update after that click on apply ok 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:02.200
 and it will seem like a message restarts and only 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.720
 being that the following if you go 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.669
 need one of these things that you 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.120
 just disable for example already 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.700
 They have to search to search the windows 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.940
 It's this research here but it goes 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.700
 keep running 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:22.120
 it is a little slower than the 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.140
 normal but it will be working because 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.220
 I just activated it by clicking here. 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:32.729
 here in energy your rpc service is not 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.729
 available 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.480
 or turned off the business here that already 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.930
 took several things 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.060
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.550
 You do not have a change, I do not like it. 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:53.480
 Do not you like it, I do not know, I do not. 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.480
 I liked it so I said until the next
