and get a good tone out of your

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.200 
and get a good tone out of your

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
amplifier then you want to start with

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.120 
amplifier then you want to start with
your<00:00:27.300> drive<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> try<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> drive

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
down on the amp to zero so you can hear

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:43.700 
down on the amp to zero so you can hear
how<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.920> sounds<00:00:40.579> almost<00:00:41.579> stupid<00:00:42.440> now<00:00:43.440> once<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
how it sounds almost stupid now once you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
how it sounds almost stupid now once you
turn<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> drive<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> turn<00:00:45.149> it

turn the drive up I'm going to turn it
to<00:00:45.270> five<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> adds<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to five here you can see it adds a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
to five here you can see it adds a
little<00:00:46.980> more<00:00:47.070> brittle<00:00:53.420> something<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
little more brittle something a little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
little more brittle something a little
bit<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.379> maybe<00:00:55.530> even<00:00:55.829> bring<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> up

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
bit more you can maybe even bring it up

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.230 
bit more you can maybe even bring it up
to<00:00:56.309> seven<00:00:56.699> depending<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.629> guitar

these<00:01:15.430> amplifiers<00:01:16.240> these<00:01:16.720> old<00:01:16.900> vampires<00:01:17.350> had

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
these amplifiers these old vampires had

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.010 
these amplifiers these old vampires had
basically<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.610> spring<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.540> back<00:01:19.720> of<00:01:19.900> the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
basically a spring in the back of the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260 
basically a spring in the back of the
amplifier<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:21.520> called<00:01:21.730> spring<00:01:22.000> reverb

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
amplifier and it's called spring reverb

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.080 
amplifier and it's called spring reverb
and<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:23.440> also<00:01:23.770> models<00:01:24.160> on<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.550> amplifier

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
and that also models on this amplifier

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.050 
and that also models on this amplifier
here<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.130> turn<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.430> zero<00:01:27.790> with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
here I'm going to turn it to zero with

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.110 
here I'm going to turn it to zero with
no<00:01:28.270> reverb

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
no reverb
