00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.230
 3 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.230
 the game appeared I wanted to talk 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.820
 how are you so hard 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.989
 vray 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.989
 yet when the game is out 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.450
 ok you want can you rate cancer like 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.050
 for me it works so well by the way 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.880
 saying full hd and the same on while she 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.490
 Looks better textures themselves 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.750
 texture will be better 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 it feels like a 30 fps limit 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.170
 but rather stable and I do not lag 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.140
 I try to play a little bit already 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.970
 and everything is stable and does not say hi 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.739
 pleasantly welcome the simplest on pro 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.670
 natural xbox or sometimes arman 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.290
 logisticians 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.300
 to be honest it happens but everything is here 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.850
 absolutely normal well aerated 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.800
 and often graphically look good I 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.590
 I do not know the principle of good lighting all 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.150
 this is anti-aliasing all as on listening as well 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.369
 if the maximum in per record is 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.180
 looks much cooler but saw something not 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.910
 all have an indicator of simon shoes yet 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.570
 I was not lost in the middle because 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.810
 jesus max there is no such 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.940
 powerful while we can here you moto subway 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.340
 close metro last light from the 2000th slide 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.800
 Here he is carrying a score of graphics that do not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.780
 I will say that it disappear immediately available 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.170
 I don’t know the device yet 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.200
 obey the miller 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.880
 convince him by the possibilities this is the voice acting and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.979
 I think I 'll show you a little bit now 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.290
 in principle it is already possible to judge the schedule 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.900
 Of course, masturbate now everyone screaming that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.850
 until better times and is one soap and 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.220
 unimportant site is simply impossible to wait 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.400
 quit and told me everyone will leave i game 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.709
 jerk I'm gameplay even more important 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.630
 I am more important than pollock from the price vasche porn 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.430
 bye games 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.410
 I download them if the price is still on 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.480
 consoles in Russia was the same, I would 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.410
 played honestly on the console now 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.480
 because my computer is not like a fountain 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.330
 become and play on the console 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 in terms of graphics and lags plan is not easier 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.519
 because i know i bought the game eat i 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.620
 I know that she will go without money 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.629
 questions so it's easier is not even here I 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.049
 medium played but so far looks better 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:44.860
 here the textures look poorly know 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.860
 smeared instructor can be combined but 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.769
 as if smoothed but too much so 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.610
 looks like 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.560
 you look in these two although playable 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.629
 In principle , I have no complaints 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.569
 but on the big screen of course it is 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.079
 it will call a taxi for the big one 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.530
 average you are not erected fish average 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.959
 prompts you so sick but all 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.810
 as well as somehow not impressive with four 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.810
 start more here waiting for more from 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:29.319
 good obedient aim to shoot 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.319
 problems infected areas full 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:47.239
 you can correctly included 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:54.040
 I am also always familiar with steel weapons 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.730
 so it could be pretty 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.120
 Dashkevich 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.120
 or what I did him I went through it than 2 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.930
 min equipment 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.560
 well done stuff took console 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.659
 just below 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.120
 us consoles are just awesome 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:20.919
 very comfortable even black while you 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.919
 said sampling idea of ​​course 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.789
 Now control the body and try not to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.750
 need to do well I think everything is with you 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:42.919
 looked here he is a robe we shoot him 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.919
 water needs to be very singing 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.780
 and spinning chosen it will penetrate 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.490
 either he will become 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.930
 here all the helmets were saved by the hero guy 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.540
 you saw everything looks like 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.740
 not bad but it could be 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.400
 better could be better as i think 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.990
 leave comments write me on 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.020
 I do not believe in achievement 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:29.350

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.350
