00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
class and its fullest I think I should

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.140 
class and its fullest I think I should
do<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> bit<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.530> work<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.980> TR<00:03:53.340> walkway<00:03:53.850> learn

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
do a bit of work on TR walkway learn

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.479 
do a bit of work on TR walkway learn
kind<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.140> how<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.350> pipe<00:03:55.709> flies<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.370> bit

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
kind of how the pipe flies a little bit

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.050 
kind of how the pipe flies a little bit
better<00:03:56.580> I'd<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.120> rely<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.989> aim<00:03:58.290> more

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
better I'd like to rely on that aim more

better I'd like to rely on that aim more
also<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.209> stickies<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:01.500> does<00:04:02.130> take<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> little

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
also the stickies it does take a little

bit<00:04:02.640> of<00:04:02.700> work<00:04:02.970> learning<00:04:03.330> how<00:04:03.600> much<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.049> charge

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
bit of work learning how much to charge

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.530 
bit of work learning how much to charge
them<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.970> fire<00:04:06.239> them<00:04:06.390> off

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
them and so that you can fire them off
