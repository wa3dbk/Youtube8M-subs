 great if you saw the first video 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.530

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 our channel could so there it is in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.750
 dying out 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:34.700
 we will dismount a cardboard so on the 4s 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.700
 it's much faster to change 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.030
 the tablecloth 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:47.280
 I had a handle and the battery is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.449

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.990
 the flex salad that makes the home button 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.010
 of the iphone 4s what makes the contact 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.750
 with a man 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:34.530

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 indicated that they retain the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 charging connectors 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 that's how it was, so we removed the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.650
 small rubber that serves as a 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:02:01.350
 big here is actually we take we take the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:05.190

 if we remove double-sided ones like those 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:03:01.380
 here is a corner there it is we take thoroughly 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:08.860
