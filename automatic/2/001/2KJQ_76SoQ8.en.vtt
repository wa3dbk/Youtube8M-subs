sound<00:02:49.840> good<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.260> don't<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.920> put<00:02:51.130> one<00:02:51.370> finger

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
sound good so don't just put one finger

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.230 
sound good so don't just put one finger
there<00:02:51.850> make<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.329> hole<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.630> minor<00:02:52.870> chord

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.360 

so<00:02:59.240> all<00:02:59.690> together<00:02:59.960> real<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:01.069> sounds<00:03:01.340> like

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
so all together real so it sounds like

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:11.809 
so all together real so it sounds like
this

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.209 

and<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:13.030> financially<00:03:13.689> just<00:03:14.650> work<00:03:14.829> your<00:03:14.980> speed

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
and so financially just work your speed

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:25.470 
and so financially just work your speed
up<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.060> speak<00:03:16.390> Bakley

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.670 

so<00:03:26.480> that's<00:03:26.749> the<00:03:26.900> main<00:03:27.049> risk<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.439> you're<00:03:27.560> gonna

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
so that's the main risk and you're gonna

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.699 
so that's the main risk and you're gonna
play<00:03:27.859> that<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.099> bunch<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.519> times<00:03:29.349> I'm<00:03:30.349> not<00:03:30.409> sure

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
play that a bunch of times I'm not sure

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.449 
play that a bunch of times I'm not sure
how<00:03:30.859> many<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.629> Singh<00:03:32.629> is<00:03:32.749> gonna<00:03:32.930> come<00:03:33.109> in<00:03:33.290> and

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
how many and Singh is gonna come in and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.550 
how many and Singh is gonna come in and
then<00:03:34.459> you're<00:03:35.299> gonna<00:03:35.420> go<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.749> course<00:03:38.560> which

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
can hit these top two open strings to be

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.810 
can hit these top two open strings to be
in<00:04:14.450> E<00:04:14.870> string<00:04:16.389> then<00:04:17.389> open<00:04:17.750> e<00:04:17.810> power<00:04:17.989> chord<00:04:18.820> then

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
in E string then open e power chord then

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.409 
in E string then open e power chord then
third<00:04:20.180> fret<00:04:20.419> a<00:04:20.570> string<00:04:20.599> power<00:04:21.049> chord<00:04:22.419> twice

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
third fret a string power chord twice

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:35.070 
third fret a string power chord twice
two<00:04:24.080> times<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:26.990> sounds<00:04:27.259> like<00:04:27.289> this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.090 

so<00:04:36.080> they<00:04:36.140> do<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.320> four<00:04:36.560> times<00:04:36.710> it's<00:04:36.950> pretty

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
so they do that four times it's pretty

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.810 
so they do that four times it's pretty
strict<00:04:37.400> for<00:04:37.580> it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
strict for it

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.340 
strict for it
and<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.420> other<00:04:38.570> guitar<00:04:38.750> has<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.050> different

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and the other guitar has a different

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.430 
and the other guitar has a different
part<00:04:39.530> see<00:04:40.100> if<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.340> is<00:04:40.690> never<00:04:41.690> actually<00:04:41.960> played

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
part see if it is never actually played

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.500 
part see if it is never actually played
this<00:04:42.620> part<00:04:42.890> for<00:04:43.130> it

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
this part for it

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.040 
this part for it
so<00:04:44.590> it's<00:04:46.210> actually<00:04:47.210> sounds<00:04:47.660> more<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:47.870> the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
so it's actually sounds more like the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.090 
so it's actually sounds more like the
singing

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.070 

that's<00:04:55.910> one<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.150> them<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.600> actually<00:04:56.720> three

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
that's one of them it's actually three

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.240 
that's one of them it's actually three
guitar<00:04:57.350> parts<00:04:57.590> here<00:04:57.740> that's<00:04:58.130> pretty

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
guitar parts here that's pretty

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.100 
guitar parts here that's pretty
interesting

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
interesting

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.300 
interesting
so<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.320> first<00:05:00.500> guitar<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:01.070> this<00:05:01.640> little

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
so the first guitar of this little

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.690 
so the first guitar of this little
background<00:05:04.310> part<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.060> 5th<00:05:05.330> fret<00:05:05.510> g<00:05:05.690> string

background part is a 5th fret g string

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.000 
background part is a 5th fret g string
