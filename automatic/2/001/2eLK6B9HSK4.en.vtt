but<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.090> say<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.450> example<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
but let's say for example you have a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.049 
but let's say for example you have a
surround<00:00:46.590> sound<00:00:46.710> system<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.730> here

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
surround sound system like we do here

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.410 
surround sound system like we do here
you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.079> change<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.590> master<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.550> by

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you can change the master to that by

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 
you can change the master to that by
pressing<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> holding<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.820> auxiliary

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
pressing and holding the auxiliary

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
pressing and holding the auxiliary
button<00:00:54.270> down<00:00:55.039> until<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> lights<00:00:56.640> blink

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

volume commands they get sent to that
surround<00:01:07.770> sound<00:01:08.070> system<00:01:09.530> let's<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.740> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
surround sound system let's say that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.500 
surround sound system let's say that
that's<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.030> though<00:01:12.270> let's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that's not what you want though let's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.210
