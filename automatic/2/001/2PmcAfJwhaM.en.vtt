00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 i 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.000
 I'm Esteban with a study and hy 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.400
 I'm going to show you a little bit of how to do 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 a catwalk hairstyle for you 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.620
 they can do it in their homes because something 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 simple something simple is to carry all the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.230
 hair well up pretty 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:28.070
 untidy without giving too much 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 importance to the prolixity this hairstyle 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.140
 It does not need too much prolixity 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.670
 being a little bit of spray nothing more 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.470
 like those with the contours so that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.470
 the little hairs are like tight 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.710
 and with the hand working with the hand and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.750
 nothing too much comb only the comb 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.820
 to untangle the hair a little after 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.899
 there we force the hair as if 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.899
 we were doing 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 actually 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.969
 a follower and we can 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:17.920
 a clip grabbing down and the rubber that 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:21.280
 it goes over all the hairstyle 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.130
 and what I do usually works 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 is to use a rubber with two clips 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.409
 a clip 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.670
 there 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.909
 and another clip 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.540
 on the other side for this to come together 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.130
 in hair and curls and no later not 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.939
 it is cut that hair when it comes out 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.960
 the community there if I start like to play 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.960
 breaking all the hair a little 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 and putting him clips so that this 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.290
 get messy 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.650
 and if I'm covering the rubber with the same 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.210
 hair used a little oiler this 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.210
 It is a product that thickens the hair 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.550
 and mojo wet the tips leaving a 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 little bit as separate gives you the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:21.580
 feeling of texture and medium texture 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.550
 separated and there I keep playing and I continue 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.680
 doing effects that I told myself as the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.680
 tips shot and broken 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.250
 all very unarmed and can be used 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.650
 to go dancing is a super hairstyle 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.390
 easy that they can do it for any 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.750
 time of day for the day or for the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.750
 night 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.700
 you have to go play or go putting clips in 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.430
 go giving it shape as one is left 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.040
 better to the face I hope you can 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 easily make your quick hairstyle 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.900
 and surely they will enjoy it
