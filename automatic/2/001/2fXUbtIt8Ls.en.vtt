anymore<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.570> can't<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
anymore because you can't use it and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
anymore because you can't use it and
well<00:01:32.189> okay<00:01:32.310> let<00:01:32.549> me<00:01:32.610> talk<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:32.970> zvz<00:01:33.270> again

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
well okay let me talk about zvz again

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.620 
well okay let me talk about zvz again
zvz<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.670> three<00:01:36.000> common<00:01:36.360> basic

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
zvz is there are three common basic

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
zvz is there are three common basic
strategies<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> two-player<00:01:37.530> map<00:01:37.680> lots<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
strategies in the two-player map lots of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.010 
strategies in the two-player map lots of
ego<00:01:38.130> center<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.610> pool<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.450> pool<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> very

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
ego center for pool for pool is very

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.649 
ego center for pool for pool is very
risky<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.700> well<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.060> risky<00:01:42.420> while<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
risky because well it's risky while the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
risky because well it's risky while the
fuck<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.170> riskier<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.799> drones

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
fuck do you think is riskier for drones

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.840 
fuck do you think is riskier for drones
how<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> fuck<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.729> your

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
how the fuck are you gonna get your

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
how the fuck are you gonna get your
economy<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.600> anyways<00:01:46.049> yeah

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
economy back like that anyways yeah

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
economy back like that anyways yeah
there's<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.430> pool<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.270> there's<00:01:48.570> also

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there's a for pool and then there's also

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
there's a for pool and then there's also
nine<00:01:49.049> pool<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> basic<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.850> safe

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
nine pool which is a basic it's a safe

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
nine pool which is a basic it's a safe
strat<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> guess<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.070> really

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
strat not that well I guess it's really

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
strat not that well I guess it's really
safe<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> basically<00:01:53.939> standard<00:01:54.329> strat

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
safe it's a basically standard strat

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.899 
safe it's a basically standard strat
strategy<00:01:55.200> most<00:01:55.439> people<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.829> except<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:56.759> most

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
strategy most people do except if most

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.370 
strategy most people do except if most
people<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.810> people<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.229> not

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
people do that then people would not

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.600 
people do that then people would not
want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> thing<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.219> counters<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
want to do the thing that counters that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
want to do the thing that counters that
because<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> beat<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.350> most

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
because they want to beat the most

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.139 
because they want to beat the most
common<00:02:01.890> strategy<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> thing<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.700> comic

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
common strategy and the thing that comic

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
common strategy and the thing that comic
counters<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> 12<00:02:04.350> pool<00:02:04.530> which<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
counters that is a 12 pool which what I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
counters that is a 12 pool which what I
did<00:02:05.579> 12<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.329> basically<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:06.990> pool<00:02:07.170> at

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
did 12 would basically get your pool at

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.619 
did 12 would basically get your pool at
12<00:02:07.560> drones<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:08.940> full<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> 12<00:02:09.390> runs

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
12 drones and I got my full a 12 runs

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
12 drones and I got my full a 12 runs
and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.259> gave<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> hatchery<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.860> after

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and then I gave a hatchery right after

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
and then I gave a hatchery right after
and<00:02:11.690> well<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.050> 12

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
and well that that's 12

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
and well that that's 12
for<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.799> there's<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.400> 12<00:02:14.730> hot<00:02:14.879> 11<00:02:15.239> pool

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
for you there's also 12 hot 11 pool

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
for you there's also 12 hot 11 pool
except<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.870> extremely<00:02:16.470> risky<00:02:16.709> Stratos

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
except that's extremely risky Stratos

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.059 
except that's extremely risky Stratos
with<00:02:18.120> 12<00:02:18.360> pool<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:19.019> 12<00:02:19.230> hatch<00:02:19.379> 11<00:02:19.680> pool<00:02:19.890> they

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
with 12 pool with 12 hatch 11 pool they

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.649 
with 12 pool with 12 hatch 11 pool they
can<00:02:20.220> easily<00:02:20.489> for<00:02:20.730> pull<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> or<00:02:21.180> nine<00:02:21.330> pull<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
can easily for pull you or nine pull you

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.600 
can easily for pull you or nine pull you
and<00:02:21.750> we'll<00:02:21.959> pull<00:02:22.349> off<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> victory<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.129> you're

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and we'll pull off a victory and you're

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.280 
and we'll pull off a victory and you're
fucked<00:02:23.849> it's<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.390> risk<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> succeed

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
fucked it's a risk but if you succeed

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.830 
fucked it's a risk but if you succeed
with<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.500> risk<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.220> good<00:02:26.760> job<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:26.970> win<00:02:27.269> well

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
with the risk then good job you win well

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.800 
with the risk then good job you win well
you<00:02:28.019> got<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.590> ahead<00:02:29.129> at<00:02:29.310> least<00:02:29.519> and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
you got your really ahead at least and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.649 
you got your really ahead at least and
again<00:02:31.099> cbz<00:02:32.099> about<00:02:32.579> specific<00:02:33.150> starting<00:02:33.569> is

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
again cbz about specific starting is

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.509 
again cbz about specific starting is
about<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.079> those<00:02:34.260> circlings<00:02:34.799> how<00:02:35.190> where<00:02:35.430> do

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
about all those circlings how where do

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.619 
about all those circlings how where do
we<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.790> do<00:02:35.879> with<00:02:36.000> your<00:02:36.030> siblings<00:02:36.510> and

we want to do with your siblings and

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.509 
we want to do with your siblings and
starting<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.079> all<00:02:37.170> matters<00:02:37.530> since<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.190> think<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
starting it all matters since I think it

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.800 
starting it all matters since I think it
got<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.730> servants<00:02:39.060> early<00:02:39.299> early<00:02:39.569> I'm<00:02:39.720> gonna

than<00:04:07.889> his<00:04:08.069> but<00:04:08.340> doesn't<00:04:08.730> really<00:04:08.760> matter<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.299> I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
than his but doesn't really matter and I

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.970 
than his but doesn't really matter and I
a<00:04:09.540> circling<00:04:10.019> speed<00:04:10.230> he<00:04:10.379> doesn't<00:04:10.709> I'm<00:04:10.859> gonna

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
a circling speed he doesn't I'm gonna

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.589 
a circling speed he doesn't I'm gonna
try<00:04:11.129> to<00:04:11.220> use<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.609> an<00:04:11.669> advantage<00:04:12.060> it's

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
try to use that to an advantage it's

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.629 
try to use that to an advantage it's
gonna<00:04:12.750> be<00:04:12.870> hard<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.139> but<00:04:13.440> I'll<00:04:13.500> try<00:04:13.680> anyways

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
gonna be hard to but I'll try anyways

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.779 
gonna be hard to but I'll try anyways
yeah<00:04:14.879> zvz<00:04:15.840> yeah<00:04:16.590> it's<00:04:16.739> all<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:16.889> all<00:04:17.609> about

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
yeah zvz yeah it's all it's all about

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:18.800 
yeah zvz yeah it's all it's all about
you<00:04:17.940> listen<00:04:18.269> certain<00:04:18.510> things<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.720> know

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
you listen certain things you know

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.779 
you listen certain things you know
there's<00:04:18.989> Michael<00:04:19.139> oh<00:04:19.349> yeah<00:04:19.769> one<00:04:20.220> big<00:04:20.459> thing<00:04:20.489> is

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
there's Michael oh yeah one big thing is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.290 
there's Michael oh yeah one big thing is
evz<00:04:21.180> cloning<00:04:21.840> scourges<00:04:22.560> do<00:04:22.680> 110<00:04:23.400> damager<00:04:23.849> 120

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
evz cloning scourges do 110 damager 120

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.600 
evz cloning scourges do 110 damager 120
so<00:04:24.479> some<00:04:25.080> 100-odd<00:04:25.919> damage

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
so some 100-odd damage

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.679 
so some 100-odd damage
and<00:04:27.729> um<00:04:28.830> with<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.860> 100<00:04:30.340> damage<00:04:30.669> Mueller's<00:04:31.479> can

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
and um with the 100 damage Mueller's can

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.360 
and um with the 100 damage Mueller's can
die<00:04:31.840> with<00:04:32.110> two<00:04:32.289> scourges<00:04:32.680> except<00:04:32.979> cloning

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
die with two scourges except cloning

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.010 
die with two scourges except cloning
means<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:34.060> basically<00:04:34.180> use<00:04:34.449> one<00:04:34.750> scourge

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
means you basically use one scourge

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.959 
means you basically use one scourge
formulas<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.830> then<00:04:35.979> your<00:04:36.340> own<00:04:36.490> your<00:04:36.759> list

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
formulas and then your own your list

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.209 
formulas and then your own your list
take<00:04:37.210> out<00:04:37.419> your<00:04:37.659> scores<00:04:38.229> is<00:04:38.409> sorry<00:04:38.979> your<00:04:39.129> own

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
take out your scores is sorry your own

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.740 
take out your scores is sorry your own
rulers<00:04:39.610> take<00:04:39.789> out<00:04:39.969> your<00:04:40.120> each<00:04:40.300> other<00:04:40.509> but

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
rulers take out your each other but

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.540 
rulers take out your each other but
they're<00:04:40.960> gonna<00:04:41.139> start<00:04:41.500> like<00:04:41.710> one<00:04:41.919> or<00:04:42.039> ten<00:04:42.280> ten

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
they're gonna start like one or ten ten

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.369 
they're gonna start like one or ten ten
life<00:04:42.759> so<00:04:43.300> it's<00:04:43.419> really<00:04:43.569> easy<00:04:43.780> that's<00:04:44.050> cloning

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
life so it's really easy that's cloning

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.439 
life so it's really easy that's cloning
for<00:04:44.530> you<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.860> little<00:04:45.729> thing<00:04:46.000> goes<00:04:46.180> far<00:04:46.419> enough

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
for you and little thing goes far enough

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.689 
for you and little thing goes far enough
for<00:04:48.509> if<00:04:49.509> this<00:04:49.990> thing<00:04:50.199> goes<00:04:50.349> far<00:04:50.650> enough<00:04:50.680> for<00:04:51.430> a

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
for if this thing goes far enough for a

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:52.890 
for if this thing goes far enough for a
mirrorless<00:04:52.270> I'll<00:04:52.539> show<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.750> guys<00:04:52.840> how

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
mirrorless I'll show you guys how

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.749 
mirrorless I'll show you guys how
cloning<00:04:53.289> works<00:04:53.439> but<00:04:53.710> I'm<00:04:53.919> expecting<00:04:54.490> this

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
cloning works but I'm expecting this

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.820 
cloning works but I'm expecting this
game<00:04:54.939> and<00:04:55.210> early<00:04:55.449> early<00:04:55.719> because<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.229> count<00:04:56.680> if

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
game and early early because I count if

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.649 
game and early early because I count if
I<00:04:56.919> I'm<00:04:57.219> too<00:04:57.430> far<00:04:57.639> behind<00:04:57.789> in<00:04:58.060> realist<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.599> I

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
I I'm too far behind in realist so I

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.969 
I I'm too far behind in realist so I
can't<00:04:58.870> let<00:04:58.990> him<00:04:59.050> get<00:04:59.139> his<00:04:59.259> new<00:04:59.349> looks<00:04:59.590> and<00:04:59.800> if

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
can't let him get his new looks and if

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.740 
can't let him get his new looks and if
he<00:05:00.099> does<00:05:00.279> I'm<00:05:00.490> going<00:05:00.639> to<00:05:00.699> lose<00:05:00.849> so<00:05:01.539> I'm<00:05:01.599> going

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
he does I'm going to lose so I'm going

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.179 
he does I'm going to lose so I'm going
to<00:05:01.779> try<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.930> pressure<00:05:02.139> I'm<00:05:02.349> really<00:05:02.710> hard<00:05:02.919> early

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:03.189 
to try to pressure I'm really hard early

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.800 
to try to pressure I'm really hard early
on<00:05:03.219> if<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.580> don't<00:05:03.789> then<00:05:04.210> I'm<00:05:04.270> going<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.479> lose<00:05:04.599> so

on if I don't then I'm going to lose so

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.390 
on if I don't then I'm going to lose so
I<00:05:04.840> better<00:05:05.110> just<00:05:05.770> constantly<00:05:06.159> put<00:05:06.310> the

I better just constantly put the

I better just constantly put the
pressure<00:05:06.550> on<00:05:06.669> him<00:05:06.819> and<00:05:06.909> get<00:05:07.000> away<00:05:07.060> from<00:05:07.180> that

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
pressure on him and get away from that

as<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.610> can<00:05:15.639> see<00:05:15.849> that<00:05:16.000> something<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.330> really

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
as you can see that something is really

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.619 
as you can see that something is really
making<00:05:17.110> me<00:05:17.379> use<00:05:18.039> my<00:05:18.219> move<00:05:18.610> my<00:05:18.759> units<00:05:19.090> in<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.389> very

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
making me use my move my units in a very

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.850 
making me use my move my units in a very
safe<00:05:19.930> manner<00:05:20.229> but<00:05:21.569> hopefully<00:05:22.569> these<00:05:23.020> units

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
safe manner but hopefully these units

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.129 
safe manner but hopefully these units
can<00:05:24.129> pick<00:05:24.669> off<00:05:24.849> some<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.150> his<00:05:25.270> units<00:05:25.719> and<00:05:25.990> I

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
can pick off some of his units and I

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.480 
can pick off some of his units and I
want<00:05:26.319> to<00:05:26.409> kill<00:05:26.529> the<00:05:26.620> sunken<00:05:26.949> because<00:05:27.219> if<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.430> do

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
want to kill the sunken because if I do

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.459 
want to kill the sunken because if I do
that's<00:05:27.759> gonna<00:05:27.849> be<00:05:28.000> really<00:05:28.120> helpful<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.719> I

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
that's gonna be really helpful and I

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.649 
that's gonna be really helpful and I

to attack him and yes I'm gonna go
attack<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:36.849> sunken<00:05:37.150> because<00:05:37.389> he<00:05:37.539> has<00:05:37.629> no

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
attack the sunken because he has no

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.689 
attack the sunken because he has no
siblings<00:05:38.050> or<00:05:38.379> like<00:05:38.529> ones<00:05:38.710> wriggling<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:39.159> I

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
siblings or like ones wriggling and I

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.010 
siblings or like ones wriggling and I
think<00:05:39.879> I<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.089> take<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.330> suck<00:05:40.509> if<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.839> take

think I can take that suck if I take

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.999 
think I can take that suck if I take
that<00:05:41.139> sunken<00:05:41.440> down<00:05:41.529> it's<00:05:41.680> gonna<00:05:41.740> be<00:05:41.919> pretty

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
evolution chamber I'm gonna go get

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.100 
evolution chamber I'm gonna go get
sports<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.610> everything<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:07.150> all<00:06:07.839> right<00:06:07.960> well

no way to get marvelous for any more
units<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:39.759> if<00:06:40.479> that<00:06:40.690> happens<00:06:40.839> then

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
units and if that happens then
