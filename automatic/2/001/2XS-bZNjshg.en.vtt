00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.130 
just gonna make a little snake little
skinny<00:00:59.530> snake<00:00:59.860> as<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.250> always<00:01:00.400> say<00:01:00.610> I'm<00:01:01.600> using<00:01:01.900> a

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
skinny snake as I always say I'm using a

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.289 
skinny snake as I always say I'm using a
secular<00:01:02.560> knife<00:01:02.770> because<00:01:03.610> I<00:01:03.910> think<00:01:04.000> it's

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
secular knife because I think it's

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.910 
secular knife because I think it's
easier<00:01:04.569> but<00:01:04.719> you<00:01:04.749> can<00:01:04.960> use<00:01:05.109> a<00:01:05.350> little<00:01:05.679> scissor

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
easier but you can use a little scissor

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.219 
easier but you can use a little scissor
if<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.280> perfectly<00:01:06.819> if<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.060> like<00:01:07.509> better<00:01:07.719> I'm

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
if you perfectly if you like better I'm

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.580 
if you perfectly if you like better I'm
cutting<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.429> one<00:01:09.880> inch<00:01:10.090> pieces<00:01:10.810> like<00:01:11.560> you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
cutting to you one inch pieces like you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.789 
cutting to you one inch pieces like you
seen<00:01:12.009> there<00:01:12.249> that's<00:01:12.549> my<00:01:12.729> mark<00:01:12.999> but<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.409> can

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
seen there that's my mark but you can

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.379 
seen there that's my mark but you can
make<00:01:14.950> bigger<00:01:15.189> or<00:01:15.399> smaller<00:01:15.579> it's<00:01:15.939> just<00:01:16.119> because

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:16.389 
make bigger or smaller it's just because

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.629 
make bigger or smaller it's just because
I<00:01:16.479> thought<00:01:16.600> then<00:01:16.780> one-inch<00:01:17.530> would<00:01:18.310> be<00:01:18.429> easier

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
I thought then one-inch would be easier

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.010 
I thought then one-inch would be easier
for<00:01:18.819> you<00:01:18.880> guys<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:19.090> see<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.600> video<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.099 
for you guys to see in the video and
then<00:01:20.530> you're<00:01:20.740> gonna<00:01:20.889> cut<00:01:21.219> a<00:01:21.549> little<00:01:22.119> bit<00:01:22.569> like

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
then you're gonna cut a little bit like

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.899 
then you're gonna cut a little bit like
smaller<00:01:23.649> than<00:01:24.039> one<00:01:24.549> one<00:01:24.759> inch<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:27.579> just

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
make sure then the size that smooth but

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.830 
make sure then the size that smooth but
not<00:01:30.579> too<00:01:30.759> tiny

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
because you're gonna need to cut it so

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.230 
because you're gonna need to cut it so
you're<00:01:34.329> gonna<00:01:34.479> have<00:01:34.600> four<00:01:35.079> pieces<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:37.119> once

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
you're gonna have four pieces to do once

less I like smaller I should say so the

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.269 
less I like smaller I should say so the
snowflake<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.259> nothing<00:01:44.799> more<00:01:44.979> than<00:01:45.130> night

it's<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.730> mess<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.150> frustrating<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.230> I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it's just a mess is frustrating so I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's just a mess is frustrating so I
decided<00:02:44.710> to<00:02:44.860> try<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.160> make<00:02:45.340> one<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.030> think

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
decided to try to make one and I think

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.960 
decided to try to make one and I think
this<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.780> looks<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.410> snowflake<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.340> it's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
this one looks like a snowflake and it's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.030 
this one looks like a snowflake and it's
super<00:02:49.360> easy<00:02:49.570> because<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:50.260> you're<00:02:50.470> making<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
super easy because if you're making a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.880 
super easy because if you're making a
cake<00:02:51.490> like<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.940> or<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.660> detail<00:02:53.410> from<00:02:53.650> frozen

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
cake like that or a detail from frozen

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.530 
cake like that or a detail from frozen
you<00:02:54.190> need<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.400> make<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> bunch<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.030> them<00:02:55.150> so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
you need to make a bunch of them so

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.330 
you need to make a bunch of them so
that's<00:02:55.870> easy<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.410> looks<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.710> CO<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.250> you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
that's easy and looks like CO and you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.390 
that's easy and looks like CO and you
can<00:02:57.550> even<00:02:57.850> wet<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.740> wet<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
can even wet make a little wet on the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760 
can even wet make a little wet on the
top<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.880> use<00:03:01.060> edible<00:03:01.480> glue<00:03:01.900> edible<00:03:02.590> glitter
