00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Welcome to an ultimately mario 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.740
 64 kart for the nintendo 64 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.980
 I'm so fun in the clear 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.980
 lightning had 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.220
 I did not want to be so far away from you 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.220
 his 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.160
 That's why I'm against the snowman 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160
 hazards 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.329
 usually not the last bit 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.899
 then I always say very nice 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 you could be nice again too 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 do not not choose but 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.379
 on demolition I think more often 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.670
 items migrated as I do this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 once dropped somewhere from here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 is back here then 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.160
 dropped down exactly and got it 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160
 somehow not checked 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.979
 I was not finished yet 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.560
 But tell exactly the same ever 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 Do not pass the rest seriously 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 half a minute or so in the wrong 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:22.470
 direction is completely driven 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.250
 ignored that was the salmon or that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.409
 you do not care 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.270
 that's so bitter I could do it now 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.759
 nothing is missing my steering 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 so bent out into hurling 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.570
 is guessed and then back to this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.450
 stupid like put 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:44.690
 8, the first quarter is the hard 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.970
 I can not stop myself 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.150
 note that sounds to hear 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.530

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.220
 otherwise the Switzerland out 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.680

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.790

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.420
