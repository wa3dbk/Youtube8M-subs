00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the 800 series phones continue and and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.100 
the 800 series phones continue and and
that<00:02:16.910> we're<00:02:17.090> borrowing<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.720> design<00:02:17.960> language

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
that we're borrowing the design language

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.220 
that we're borrowing the design language
of<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> icon<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> slimmer<00:02:20.420> phone

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
of the icon so this is a slimmer phone

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.770 
of the icon so this is a slimmer phone
than<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.500> icon<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.100> they<00:02:22.730> use<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.180> new<00:02:23.390> slimmer

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
than the icon and they use a new slimmer

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.960 
than the icon and they use a new slimmer
image<00:02:24.290> stabilization<00:02:24.710> so<00:02:25.490> there<00:02:25.610> isn't<00:02:25.910> as

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
image stabilization so there isn't as

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.790 
image stabilization so there isn't as
much<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.270> camera<00:02:26.570> bump<00:02:26.870> coming<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.710> the
