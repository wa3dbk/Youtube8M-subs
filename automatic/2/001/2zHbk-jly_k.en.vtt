00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:13.719
 we will see in this lesson how to print projects so much that the modern environment 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:16.699
 as the name says layout 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.960
 now that our project is positioned properly in the folia 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.710
 print it 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 the print command is located in two places for 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 autocratic interfaces 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.680
 in the toolbar 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 via the voting option 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 or the name of the Flemish in the option 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 duarte 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 It starts there speaking so it gives projects impression and does not delete 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.230
 mobile 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.400
 with mobile brt being displayed 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.510
 I'll select the port command 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.710
 and a dialog box opens 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 and she'll set the form 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560
 As with our project, it will be at home. 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.110
 so that's why I'm going to select my printer 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.390
 I'm going to use a virtual printer 'here on the paper size I'm going to use 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.080
 the a4 I will expand is that the options of my box 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.530
 and pressure 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 I will keep the option for three either portrait to print here dry 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.930
 my project 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.490
 and still here 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.439
 I'll 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.219
 defined area is that the print area as an idol so I can teach the 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:30.190
 coach option 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.280
 now 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.799
 I defend here my window of impression you never know here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 I'll click again 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.530
 and ready I already have my print area defined 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.330
 now after clicking here predicted 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.820
 to see how my 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.369
 project will be at home, see here I have participated 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.909
 removed from my project so I go 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.670
 close network print preview and I'll put it here in 100 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.220
 hectares 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.320
 of doors 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.110
 that is my preview window there that I 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.159
 set to print 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.120
 will be centered on the daren folia predicted now and see that now I have 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.510
 my project properly positioned in the print shop now just send 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.249
 print that it will come out this way it came out again here 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.399
 printing environment 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.449
 and click ok to print 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.379
 now i will show you how to print a project in the collegiate environment 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.419
 for this then 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.669
 active 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.290
 when I already have my project properly configured 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.179
 according to the previous one we did nothing 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.040
 and I'll activate the command 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.519
 crooked 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.029
 now with the command with the attractive I no longer need qinglin in the environment 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:01.299
 real to do a lot of things because I would not have mind set the environment 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.149
 with the printer as I can already see here folio size 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.539
 the orientation 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.459
 It's all set 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.649
 here the only thing you need is 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.510
 view print 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 which is not how she's going to stay, see here 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.619
 she is 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:26.239
 in a properly positioned position that is not on my slack is everything 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.579
 right 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.189
 did your viewing 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.189
 and confirms that printing as here 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.189
 as we can already see here 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 a loyal mind of always the right environment 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.409
 to make impressions because we already have everything previously configured 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 it is not even in the mobile environment where we have q 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.590
 the adefibi area that will be interesting 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.470
 the usual position is in the party 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.150
 set up printer 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.879
 the mother off 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.239
 guidance 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.249
 all those details that you do not need are configured in the 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.079
 layout and why 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.329
 at the time we assemble the project does not have to win everything already configure by itself 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.579
 only 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.579
 and so with bribes in this class 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.549
 clear that the Senate project was not 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.949
 here in case they have a printer each is a virtual printer ' 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:25.979
 sorry 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.319
 but yes we can use any printer that the procedure will be with 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:30.849
 the same
