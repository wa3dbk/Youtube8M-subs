00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 spectacular flat porcini but 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.820
 what we start from not these two things 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.029
 but the red potato potatoes that we will leave 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.619
 with the peel a beautiful pan where 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:30.199
 we will put a little oil so abundant 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.540
 and let's start slicing our potato 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.890
 the thickness must be more or less 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 these height 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 naturally the finer you do it the more 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.370
 it will quickly unfold as you see not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.050
 I'm putting everything in line because now 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.050
 then later we will add the porcino 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:04.330
 here we say for first layer can go 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.040
 well let's take one of our porcini mushrooms 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 this one, too, you don't care how 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.270
 you want to do more or less fine it seems 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.270
 we are a bit and we continue 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.400
 here is made of rosolio a beautiful if 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.050
 Latin a round of expected but this is it 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.759
 absolutely an optional thing though 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.910
 you like me and put it 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.830
 let's take a little bit of fresh thyme 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:37.009
 let's cut it here and put it 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.060
 just like that without having to clean it 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:45.700
 too much a quarter of an hour in the oven at 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.890
 maximum power and now let's move on 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.990
 to our bass and at this point 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.990
 you can choose you can choose if 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 cook the whole fish or challenges 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.770
 perna in this case is a nice bass 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.300
 of almost a kilo we will go to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 fillet the but if you have sea bass 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.950
 from portion 23 and you should leave it 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.979
 whole is quite simple two 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.660
 knives a flexible blade and a blade 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.759
 rigid rigid blade 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 we start with a slight incision in 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.670
 almost correspondence of the bee of the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 flexible knife blade tail 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.800
 this is the part of that which corresponds 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.020
 to the central spine 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.080
 insert the blade up here at the top so 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.990
 above and then begin slowly has 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.569
 elapsed and the knife because the blade 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.580
 soft this flexible blade because yes 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.750
 can then lean over the plug then 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.190
 does not force and you can not 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.740
 ruin our fillets arrived at 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.270
 this point then we have raised 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.250
 we have already arrived in correspondence 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.050
 of the central bone what we do 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.989
 we always take our knife will have 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.319
 a stiff one and we cut under the branch 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.510
 so, and we carry it up even around like that 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.069
 can you see see here is where 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.730
 we opened to clean it then us 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.100
 we thus engrave in such a way as to arrive 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.060
 in correspondence 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.400
 of the opening we have already made 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.710
 this is our first fillet 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.530
 look how wonderful 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.560
 let's do the same operation again at 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.930
 contrary as you see I have not removed the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.600
 skin because anyway we will need it as 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.670
 protection when the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200
 put in the oven here is we give him 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.350
 make a sort of fast marina a 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.210
 let's get this fish sliced 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.580
 the porcino we had kept from 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.830
 it starts very finely so it begins 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.150
 lay them on top of our slices 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.560
 leave some space naturally 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.560
 you don't have to completely cover oil 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.560
 online 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:57.030
 I would say that we are there and still remain 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.820
 above with the oil which of course an hour 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.310
 that you are romatizing toe with with the team 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 with porcini we can put ours 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.070
 fillets as you see have been and 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 Marinate 23 minutes that's fine if 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.570
 we take it as if it were some kind of 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.480
 sandwich on his porcino under the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.170
 then turn the pulp towards the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.880
 potatoes and the skin outwards a 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.650
 pinch of salt on each fillet 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.470
 let's get back in the oven always temperature 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.470
 beautiful rich five minutes no more 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:39.000
 here it is now we take a nice plate o 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:44.700
 let's try to make a nice bed 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.420
 here is this fillet and this sleep a 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.230
 this is our sea bass with potatoes and 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.490
 porcini but final touch live from 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.490
 spray on so
