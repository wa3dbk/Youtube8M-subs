00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Hardata TV was created using a concept of simplicity
of use, so itÂ´s settings are very simple.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
First of all when the system boots
it automatically uploads the application,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.000
and configuration menus are very
simple,
4
00:00:33,500 --&gt; 00:00:40,000
such as upload the date and time,
regional and network settings, 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
All these actions are done
directly from the application,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
because the user does not directly
access to the OS.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.006
The rest is set only once, which is
how we will set up our station.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We upload the language, choose the broadcast mode, if it is going
to be SD or HD, in this case we will leave the HD mode,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.500
the name of the station and we can choose
playlist mode or the instant play mode.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In this case we will choose the playlist mode and give OK to
settings and the systmen will automatically upload the schedule.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.000
In this case the system will search the schedule for the 
corresponding day, and if not found

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.001
Just as what has happened now, the system will upload an
emergency schedule we have specially prepared for this,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.500
the system never stops, it always tries to
upload the day's schedule

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.550
and if not found, it automatically uploads
emergency one.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
All you have to do is click
PLAY and the system begins to emit,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
through commands included in the programming,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the system will load the graphics projects: Animated logos,
Sockets and character generator.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In this case there is a command to fade in and another  one to fade out the project.
The last one is activated 5 seconds before the end of material

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
These commands can be set up to upload
several projects automatically.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
and the projects can also be uploaded
manually.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.500
I'll choose another Template,
for example news,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.500
I am going to publish and automatically the system will upload an
animated logo, with character generator with scroll and more.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The rest of the system is
very intuitive and very easy to use.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.500
any person who uses
Windows can use this screen,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.500
It has a classic keypad with the commands of any
machine: STOP, PLAY, PAUSE, jump to the next clip,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It is very simple and very easy to use.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.000
That is the concept on which Hardata TV is founded,
to be user-friendly and have intuitive screens
