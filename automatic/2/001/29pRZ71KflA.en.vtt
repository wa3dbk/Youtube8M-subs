00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
Sidewinder is definitely in my opinion a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
Sidewinder is definitely in my opinion a
better<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> take<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> Titans<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.239> know

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
better way to take out the Titans I know

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.729 
better way to take out the Titans I know
a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> people<00:01:00.780> were<00:01:01.050> complaining<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a lot of people were complaining this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
a lot of people were complaining this
game<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> Titans<00:01:02.670> work<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
game that the Titans work you know a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
game that the Titans work you know a
little<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:03.930> too<00:01:04.170> powerful<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.100> kind<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little bit too powerful which I kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
little bit too powerful which I kind of
agree<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.810> annoying<00:01:07.110> having<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
agree it's a little annoying having to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.390 
agree it's a little annoying having to
shoot<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.220> sometimes<00:01:10.070> many<00:01:11.070> ways<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
shoot them down sometimes many ways the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
shoot them down sometimes many ways the
game<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> called<00:01:11.850> titanfall<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.680> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
game is called titanfall but on that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.310 
game is called titanfall but on that
subject<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.640> wish<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> game

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
subject I do wish that there was a game

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
subject I do wish that there was a game
type<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:16.799> there<00:01:16.920> were<00:01:16.979> no<00:01:17.130> Titans<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

feel<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.189> little<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
feel like maybe a little bit of a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.570 
feel like maybe a little bit of a
smaller<00:01:24.090> maps<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.380> player<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.280> player
