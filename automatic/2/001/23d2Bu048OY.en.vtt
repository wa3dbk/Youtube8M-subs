however the Chewie feels more fragile

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.480 
however the Chewie feels more fragile
than<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.750> newborn<00:01:36.200> baby<00:01:36.440> because<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.400> is

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.440 
encased in glass I feel like I could
break<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.250> at<00:01:40.340> any<00:01:40.550> moment<00:01:40.910> if<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.090> dropped<00:01:41.330> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.810 
enough to take decent pictures
therefore<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.560> declare<00:03:52.040> both<00:03:52.220> these<00:03:52.400> tablets

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
therefore I declare both these tablets

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.630 
therefore I declare both these tablets
to<00:03:52.940> be<00:03:52.970> equally<00:03:53.360> bad<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.530> after<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.100> comparison

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
to be equally bad so after a comparison

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.640 
to be equally bad so after a comparison
of<00:03:55.760> both<00:03:55.880> tablets<00:03:56.180> I'm<00:03:56.690> still<00:03:57.350> completely

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
of both tablets I'm still completely

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.440 
of both tablets I'm still completely
undecided<00:03:58.520> on<00:03:58.610> which<00:03:58.880> one<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.150> better

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
undecided on which one is better

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.270 
undecided on which one is better

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
either option is just about as good as

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.470 
either option is just about as good as
the<00:04:03.380> others<00:04:03.590> but<00:04:03.800> in<00:04:04.010> different<00:04:04.280> ways<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:05.330> up

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
the others but in different ways it's up

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.060
