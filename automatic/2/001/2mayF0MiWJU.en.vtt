some<00:01:28.170> fancy<00:01:28.350> fancy-schmancy<00:01:29.549> well

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
some fancy fancy-schmancy well

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
some fancy fancy-schmancy well
anyway<00:01:30.650> I'll<00:01:31.650> try<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.930> Pat<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.320> long<00:01:34.439> as

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
anyway I'll try to Pat it out as long as

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.920 
anyway I'll try to Pat it out as long as
I<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:35.520> getting<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.060> pandas<00:01:36.420> and

animation<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.210> mean<00:02:24.360> no<00:02:24.570> disrespect<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.050> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
animation I mean no disrespect to the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.300 
animation I mean no disrespect to the
guys<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.560> made<00:02:25.710> this<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.250> is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
guys that made this I think this is

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.570 
guys that made this I think this is
actually<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> pretty<00:02:26.880> good<00:02:27.180> homebrew<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.920> yeah

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
actually a pretty good homebrew but yeah

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.110 
actually a pretty good homebrew but yeah
outside<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:30.590> well<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.520> it's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
outside of that it's well it's it's

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.230 
outside of that it's well it's it's
Donkey<00:02:33.570> Kong<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.050> thus<00:02:34.410> Ness<00:02:35.240> actually

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
Donkey Kong on thus Ness actually

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.160 
Donkey Kong on thus Ness actually
there's<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.480> other<00:02:36.690> thing<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.959> don't<00:02:37.020> quite

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
there's one other thing I don't quite

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
there's one other thing I don't quite
like<00:02:37.290> them<00:02:37.560> well<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.340> don't<00:02:39.270> want<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.600> say<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
like them well I don't want to say I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.840 
like them well I don't want to say I
don't<00:02:39.840> quite<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.190> think<00:02:41.550> could<00:02:41.700> use

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
don't quite like but I think could use

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.520 
don't quite like but I think could use
some<00:02:42.000> work<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> actual<00:02:42.780> soundtrack

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
some work is the actual soundtrack

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.160 
some work is the actual soundtrack
itself<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.160> mean<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:45.180> obviously<00:02:45.330> reusing

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
itself I mean they're obviously reusing

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.020 
itself I mean they're obviously reusing
the<00:02:46.470> classic<00:02:46.860> songs<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> arcade<00:02:47.790> game

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
the classic songs from the arcade game

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.360 
the classic songs from the arcade game
but<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:49.140> feels<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> instruments<00:02:50.160> are

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
but it it feels like the instruments are

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.690 
but it it feels like the instruments are
a<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:52.020> white<00:02:52.800> side<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.220> guess<00:02:53.580> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
a bit on the white side I guess you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
a bit on the white side I guess you
could<00:02:53.820> say<00:02:54.000> okay<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.630> get<00:02:54.750> something<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.110> little

and as always you can start again from
the<00:03:28.080> very<00:03:28.260> beginning<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.700> new<00:03:29.880> level<00:03:30.239> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
the very beginning on a new level and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.970 
the very beginning on a new level and
all<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.690> jazz<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:33.080> guess<00:03:34.080> with<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.260> said<00:03:34.650> um

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
all that jazz I guess with that said um

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.220 
all that jazz I guess with that said um
well<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> don't<00:03:36.239> really<00:03:36.420> want<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.600> end<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.870> here

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230
