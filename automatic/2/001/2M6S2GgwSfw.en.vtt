00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
I actually get side before most of the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.240 
I actually get side before most of the
Rings<00:03:10.990> if<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.380> get<00:03:11.650> an<00:03:11.770> early<00:03:12.040> enough<00:03:12.190> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
Rings if you get an early enough you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
Rings if you get an early enough you
just<00:03:12.370> also

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
portion the easiest strategy for this

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
part is just chuck mines one by one take

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.309 
part is just chuck mines one by one take
them<00:03:23.940> out

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319

this<00:04:20.820> part<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.120> kind<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.389> dangerous<00:04:21.509> this<00:04:21.930> is

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
this part is kind of dangerous this is

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.150 
this part is kind of dangerous this is
probably<00:04:22.199> most<00:04:22.410> dangerous<00:04:22.800> part<00:04:23.009> of<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
probably most dangerous part of the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.260 
probably most dangerous part of the
strategy<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.849> refilling<00:04:24.660> your<00:04:24.870> energy<00:04:26.270> be

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
strategy is refilling your energy be

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.790 
strategy is refilling your energy be
careful<00:04:27.630> make<00:04:27.810> sure<00:04:27.840> there's<00:04:28.110> nobody<00:04:28.410> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
careful make sure there's nobody to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.310 
careful make sure there's nobody to
close<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.550> should<00:04:29.729> be<00:04:29.759> fine<00:04:30.320> as

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
close to you and you should be fine as

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.689 
close to you and you should be fine as
you<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.530> see<00:04:31.740> right<00:04:31.770> here<00:04:32.039> they<00:04:32.220> didn't<00:04:32.490> see

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
you can see right here they didn't see

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.020 
you can see right here they didn't see
me<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.479> just<00:04:33.539> reek<00:04:34.199> loke<00:04:34.440> run<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:35.669> full

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
me so I just reek loke run I have full

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.540 
me so I just reek loke run I have full
energy<00:04:36.690> now<00:04:36.889> so<00:04:37.889> go<00:04:38.099> back<00:04:38.220> out

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
energy now so go back out

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.610 
energy now so go back out
toss<00:04:40.550> line<00:04:41.210> right<00:04:41.540> under<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.930> feet<00:04:42.140> of<00:04:42.170> one<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
toss line right under the feet of one of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.480 
toss line right under the feet of one of
these<00:04:42.740> guys<00:04:45.790> boom<00:04:46.790> one<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:48.020> down<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.530> switch

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
these guys boom one more down I switch

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.010 
these guys boom one more down I switch
sides<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.970> see<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.150> better<00:04:50.330> access<00:04:50.570> at<00:04:50.900> the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
sides you see a better access at the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.370 
sides you see a better access at the
guys<00:04:51.170> that<00:04:51.200> are<00:04:51.470> still<00:04:51.800> there<00:04:52.120> unfortunately

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
guys that are still there unfortunately

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.900 
guys that are still there unfortunately
with<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.620> low<00:04:54.890> amount<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.220> energy<00:04:55.340> how<00:04:55.700> right

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
with the low amount of energy how right

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.120 
with the low amount of energy how right
now<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:56.300> only<00:04:56.420> do<00:04:56.990> one<00:04:57.290> or<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.920> can<00:04:58.040> only

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
now you can only do one or you can only

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.150 
now you can only do one or you can only
do<00:04:58.310> two<00:04:58.460> minds<00:04:58.700> /<00:04:59.030> energy<00:04:59.860> bar<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.920> guy

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
do two minds / energy bar so this guy

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.030 
do two minds / energy bar so this guy
was<00:05:04.850> pretty<00:05:05.030> easy<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.450> take<00:05:05.600> out<00:05:05.890> he's<00:05:06.890> already

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
was pretty easy to take out he's already

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.580 
was pretty easy to take out he's already
hurt<00:05:07.340> from<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.670> line<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:09.200> hit<00:05:09.320> him<00:05:09.410> once

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
hurt from the line I just hit him once

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.280 
hurt from the line I just hit him once
like<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:09.970> or<00:05:10.970> hit<00:05:11.570> him<00:05:11.660> once<00:05:11.870> knocked<00:05:12.110> him

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
like that or hit him once knocked him

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.380 
like that or hit him once knocked him
down<00:05:12.320> hit<00:05:12.590> him<00:05:12.680> once<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.760> killed<00:05:14.090> him<00:05:14.240> I

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
down hit him once and killed him I

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.240 
down hit him once and killed him I
didn't<00:05:14.990> charge<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.680> didn't<00:05:15.890> cost<00:05:16.040> a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
didn't charge it so it didn't cost a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.220 
didn't charge it so it didn't cost a
whole<00:05:16.340> lot<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.490> energy<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:17.660> now<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:17.870> think

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
whole lot of energy and now I think

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.300 
whole lot of energy and now I think
there<00:05:18.440> are<00:05:18.470> only<00:05:19.060> another<00:05:20.060> three<00:05:20.420> left<00:05:21.310> this

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
there are only another three left this

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.960 
there are only another three left this
guy<00:05:22.490> came<00:05:22.550> up<00:05:22.850> here<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:23.720> stealth<00:05:24.020> kill<00:05:24.230> him<00:05:24.470> or

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
guy came up here so stealth kill him or

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.090 
guy came up here so stealth kill him or
can't<00:05:25.970> tell<00:05:26.600> which<00:05:26.840> one<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:29.360> they're<00:05:29.570> dead<00:05:29.750> I

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
can't tell which one so they're dead I

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.440 
can't tell which one so they're dead I
kept<00:05:31.100> thinking<00:05:31.220> all<00:05:31.790> right<00:05:31.850> at<00:05:32.120> first<00:05:32.270> i

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
kept thinking all right at first i

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.970 
kept thinking all right at first i
thought<00:05:32.480> that<00:05:32.750> guy<00:05:33.170> was<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.500> only<00:05:33.590> guy<00:05:33.740> left

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
thought that guy was the only guy left

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.310 
thought that guy was the only guy left
but<00:05:34.190> i<00:05:34.220> heard<00:05:34.430> two<00:05:34.610> people<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.840> then<00:05:36.020> i<00:05:36.140> saw

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
but i heard two people so then i saw

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.810 
but i heard two people so then i saw
that<00:05:36.500> second<00:05:36.980> person<00:05:39.370> waited<00:05:40.370> around<00:05:40.490> a

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
that second person waited around a

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.260 
that second person waited around a
little<00:05:40.970> bit<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.390> luckily<00:05:42.460> one<00:05:43.460> of<00:05:43.490> them<00:05:43.790> went

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
little bit and luckily one of them went

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.660 
little bit and luckily one of them went
back<00:05:44.540> upstairs<00:05:44.810> so<00:05:45.260> I<00:05:45.320> can<00:05:45.380> stealth<00:05:45.770> kill<00:05:46.010> or

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
back upstairs so I can stealth kill or

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.330 
back upstairs so I can stealth kill or
regular<00:05:47.480> kill<00:05:47.720> that<00:05:48.470> person<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:48.980> not<00:05:49.130> sure

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
regular kill that person I'm not sure

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.740 
regular kill that person I'm not sure
