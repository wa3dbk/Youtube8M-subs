to<00:02:04.329> put<00:02:04.600> your<00:02:04.630> oils<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.740> your<00:02:05.890> beeswax<00:02:06.399> and

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
to put your oils and your beeswax and

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.770 
to put your oils and your beeswax and
that<00:02:06.909> sort<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.119> thing<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.390> then<00:02:07.509> this<00:02:07.600> pot

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
that sort of thing and then this pot

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540 
that sort of thing and then this pot
you're<00:02:07.899> going<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.080> be<00:02:08.140> doing<00:02:08.259> more<00:02:08.920> glycerin

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
you're going to be doing more glycerin

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.110 
you're going to be doing more glycerin
the<00:02:10.000> glycerin<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.690> water-based<00:02:12.120> ingredients

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the glycerin and water-based ingredients

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.890 
the glycerin and water-based ingredients
so<00:02:13.330> over<00:02:14.230> here<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.090> shred<00:02:16.510> mine

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
so over here I have I like to shred mine

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.570 
so over here I have I like to shred mine
because<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.800> melts<00:02:17.980> quicker<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
because it melts quicker and it it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.830 
because it melts quicker and it it
doesn't<00:02:22.800> expose<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.040> oils<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.940> heat<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:25.810> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
doesn't expose the oils to heat for a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.199 
doesn't expose the oils to heat for a
long<00:02:25.989> or<00:02:26.530> very<00:02:26.890> long<00:02:27.069> period<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.400> time<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:27.790> this

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
long or very long period of time so this

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.030 
long or very long period of time so this
is<00:02:28.269> beeswax<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.430> cocoa<00:02:30.430> butter<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
is beeswax and this is cocoa butter and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.039 
is beeswax and this is cocoa butter and
for<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> beeswax<00:02:34.090> you're<00:02:34.299> going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.630> 2

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
for the beeswax you're going to do 2

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.809 
for the beeswax you're going to do 2
tablespoons<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.950> beeswax<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.519> you're<00:02:36.700> going

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
tablespoons of beeswax and you're going

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.250 
tablespoons of beeswax and you're going
to<00:02:36.880> put<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.180> with<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.799> oil<00:02:38.799> here<00:02:40.260> so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
to put it in with the oil here so

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.949 
to put it in with the oil here so
there's<00:02:41.620> two<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.280> don't<00:02:42.640> got<00:02:42.850> two<00:02:43.120> particular<00:02:43.480> I

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
there's two I don't got two particular I

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.479 
there's two I don't got two particular I
mean<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.410> couldn't<00:02:44.709> do<00:02:44.769> heaping<00:02:45.190> ones<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
mean I couldn't do heaping ones it

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.009 
mean I couldn't do heaping ones it
doesn't<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:45.790> matter<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.269> more<00:02:46.480> beeswax

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
doesn't really matter the more beeswax

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.250 
doesn't really matter the more beeswax
you<00:02:47.200> put<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.519> thicker<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.110> be

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you put in the thicker it's going to be

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.890 
you put in the thicker it's going to be
because<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.340> beeswax<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.910> beeswax<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
because the beeswax is beeswax is the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.550 
because the beeswax is beeswax is the
emulsifier<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.780> ocean<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
emulsifier of the of the ocean so the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080 
emulsifier of the of the ocean so the
more<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:56.739> got<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.160> there<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> harder<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
more you got in there the harder and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.420 
more you got in there the harder and
thicker<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:59.049> going<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.830> 2

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
thicker it's going to be so 2

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.590 
thicker it's going to be so 2
tablespoons<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:01.150> beeswax<00:03:01.510> 1<00:03:02.349> tablespoon<00:03:03.280> of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
cocoa butter put these on here and

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.860 
cocoa butter put these on here and
you're<00:03:08.470> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.650> want<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:08.950> heat<00:03:09.190> these<00:03:09.430> on

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
you're going to want to heat these on

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.920 
you're going to want to heat these on
low<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.820> said<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.269> don't<00:03:13.390> want<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.720> expose

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.819 
your oils to high heat so you can do
this<00:03:16.299> on<00:03:16.480> low<00:03:16.690> or<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.049> can<00:03:17.200> do<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> double

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829

really ok next you're going to put
lanolin<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:27.510> lanolin<00:03:28.510> is<00:03:28.750> basically<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
lanolin in it lanolin is basically the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.220

that like I said on low until all of
this<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.920> melted<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:06.750> don't<00:04:06.900> see<00:04:07.139> flecks

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this is melted and you don't see flecks

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.449 
this is melted and you don't see flecks
of<00:04:08.329> beeswax<00:04:09.329> or<00:04:09.569> cocoa<00:04:10.049> butter<00:04:10.079> up<00:04:10.530> also

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
of beeswax or cocoa butter up also

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.759 
of beeswax or cocoa butter up also
you're<00:04:11.609> going<00:04:11.669> to<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.849> putting<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.769> something

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
get harmed by the heat in this pot so

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.390 
get harmed by the heat in this pot so
and<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:54.320> just<00:05:54.500> basically<00:05:54.650> want<00:05:55.010> to<00:05:55.070> heat<00:05:55.280> the

and you just basically want to heat the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.960 
and you just basically want to heat the
water<00:05:55.430> until<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:57.680> borax<00:05:58.280> is<00:05:58.490> dissolved<00:05:58.880> and

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
water until the borax is dissolved and

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.310 
water until the borax is dissolved and
then<00:05:59.090> you<00:05:59.210> can<00:05:59.330> take<00:05:59.450> it<00:05:59.630> off<00:05:59.750> which<00:05:59.960> doesn't

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
then you can take it off which doesn't

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.710 
then you can take it off which doesn't
take<00:06:00.470> very<00:06:00.590> much<00:06:00.680> time<00:06:00.979> at<00:06:01.160> all<00:06:01.250> so<00:06:02.150> after<00:06:02.360> this

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
take very much time at all so after this

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.029 
take very much time at all so after this
is<00:06:02.960> done<00:06:03.190> melting<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:06.500> everything<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:06.950> all

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
is done melting and everything is all

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.770 
is done melting and everything is all
melted<00:06:07.190> together<00:06:07.490> you're<00:06:08.240> going<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.479> set

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
melted together you're going to set

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.909 
melted together you're going to set
you're<00:06:08.930> going<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.110> take<00:06:09.289> it<00:06:09.320> off<00:06:09.530> the<00:06:09.710> burner

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
you're going to take it off the burner

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.730 
you're going to take it off the burner
and<00:06:10.190> let<00:06:10.610> it<00:06:10.639> sit<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.450> it<00:06:12.110> what<00:06:12.229> will<00:06:12.350> happen

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
and let it sit and it what will happen

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.170 
and let it sit and it what will happen
is<00:06:12.860> you'll<00:06:13.039> start<00:06:13.280> actually<00:06:13.460> seeing<00:06:13.910> it

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
is you'll start actually seeing it

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.760 
is you'll start actually seeing it
thicken<00:06:14.990> because<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.919> beeswax<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.669> cooling

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
thicken because the beeswax is cooling

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.080 
thicken because the beeswax is cooling
so<00:06:18.770> you<00:06:18.860> want<00:06:19.039> it<00:06:19.100> to<00:06:19.190> get<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.340> little<00:06:19.430> thick<00:06:19.880> and

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
so you want it to get a little thick and

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.290 
so you want it to get a little thick and
it<00:06:20.150> takes<00:06:20.330> about<00:06:20.830> mmm<00:06:21.830> 5<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.370> 10<00:06:22.580> minutes<00:06:22.760> and

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
it takes about mmm 5 to 10 minutes and

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.940 
it takes about mmm 5 to 10 minutes and
that's<00:06:23.990> what<00:06:24.260> I'm<00:06:24.350> going<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.560> show<00:06:24.710> you<00:06:24.800> what

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
that's what I'm going to show you what

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.020 
that's what I'm going to show you what
to<00:06:25.039> do<00:06:25.160> with<00:06:25.280> your<00:06:25.370> next<00:06:25.580> step<00:06:25.850> so<00:06:26.180> you<00:06:26.900> go
