00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.340
 report that traces a people and 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.660
 big twists of this affair 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.790
 August 21, 2014 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.730
 the destiny of pascal akoussoulèlou 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 bodjona rocking again while he 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 responded to the umpteenth summons of the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 judge the former minister of 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 the territorial administration sees itself 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:31.949
 notify a deposit warrant the surprise 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.469
 is total as much as pascal bodjona 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.300
 had just filed a petition that the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.530
 judge had to communicate to the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
 indictment chamber 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.480
 a cold shower for the lawyers of the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.670
 minister who scream at the manipulation of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.070
 justice by an invisible hand 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 we almost forget that it does not 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 was just a simple matter 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340
 of fraud in which pascal 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.530
 Bodjona was a witness over 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.539
 is under oath 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.730
 we have to go back in time to identify the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.359
 many facets and twists of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 this case 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.689
 March 2, 2011 an emirate of a wave abas 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 Aliyev complains against 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.400
 wealthy businessman akbas 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.170
 aubertin for scam several names 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 are cited in the sphere in that of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 Bodjona minister who was heard on the 18th 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.439
 March 2011 by the gendarmerie in his 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 Preliminary investigation 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.100
 she will later conclude to his innocence 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.140
 absolute then August 10, 2012 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.140
 he is heard as witnesses under 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 oath by the investigating judge the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.520
 surprise will come a few weeks after 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.040
 when the witness becomes acrobatic 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.840
 legal an accused 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 bodjona is sent a first time in 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.689
 held on 1 September 2012 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.509
 it will only come out on April 9, 2013 either 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.350
 seven months and nine days of detention at 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.840
 the gendarmerie 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 meanwhile the twists are going to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.680
 multiply 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.409
 the main accused to bassoon berthet and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 the former director of elf loïk the floch 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.500
 prigent will also know various 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 fortunes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 both will find the least to leave 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.340
 the country and the plaintiff is also 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.989
 missing in action 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.420
 despite the absence of the main authors 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.610
 and the complainant 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.800
 justice will continue to persecute 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.410
 on the bodjona minister who went from 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.700
 status of witnesses under oath to that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.400
 sworn inmates 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 after a double charge for the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.310
 same charge of complicity 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.730
 scam 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.160
 since August 21, 2014 and promised to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.050
 civilian prison of thiviers he never stopped 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.790
 to multiply the recourse to the plan 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.370
 national and international 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.920
 the court of justice of the cedeao that has 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.489
 been seized in this case has made his 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.380
 verdict on April 24 last verdict which 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.900
 pinpoint the Togolese state to many 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.030
 the court did not go by 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.670
 four weeks to demonstrate that the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.040
 detention of bodjona is arbitrary and 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.260
 that his rights have been violated 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.940
 almost all the arguments put forward by 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.870
 the Togolese state fell like a 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.569
 castle of cards 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.049
 the court of the cedeao not hesitating even 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.880
 to qualify these arguments of jus site 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.250
 specious there for watches in his 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.110
 stop the state of the togo is limited to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.299
 assert that he was charged and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.040
 this setting was motivated by 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.560
 the existence of serious and 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.820
 concordants of guilt or 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.310
 that there are plausible reasons 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.420
 that he committed an offense without 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.820
 never specified 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.430
 these clues or his reasons all things 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.260
 which make the court of justice of the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.700
 cedeao orders the Togolese state 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.530
 to arrange the trial of sir 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.329
 bodjona rossouw the paschal wolves in 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.060
 the best delays or lack of elements 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.100
 against him to release them 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.650
 despite this decision we can not 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.019
 crystal clear not only the trial of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.640
 bodjona was not organized which 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.459
 would be difficult in the absence 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.739
 authors but worse he is still in 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.390
 detention at the civil prison of thiviers 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.430
 August 21st 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.310
 they buckle a year to the day in 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.130
 this prison added to the past seven months 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.390
 at the gendarmerie is almost 20 months of 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.970
 preventive dentention 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.160
 pre-trial detention under 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.840
 Article 112 of the Code of Procedure 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.920
 criminal togo is a measure 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.500
 exceptional 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.769
 it is clear that the principle remains the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.049
 freedom and Article 113 of the same Code 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.479
 provides that freedom is by right 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.669
 where preventive detention 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.720
 reaches half of the maximum sentence 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.240
 incurred 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.760
 in this case the maximum of the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.950
 punishment incurred is three years pascal 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.800
 Bodjona has thus far exceeded the 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.160
 half of the maximum of the penalty incurred 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.140
 so should be released 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.270
 even worse the bodjona minister in 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.800
 this case is only charged with 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.740
 complicity of scam 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.540
 would the alleged accomplice have become 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.880
 more guilty than the alleged perpetrators 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.370
 who are still running 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.050
 the judgment delivered on 17 April 2014 by the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.300
 Supreme Court in the so-called 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.850
 fires is very eloquent on the fact 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.130
 of complicity complicity is a 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.080
 emperor's offense and that it can 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.480
 aggravate the fate of the alleged accomplice 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.980
 while the author is at liberty to - 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.920
 for the judge to presume from the 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.900
 guilt of the accomplice to the alleged 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.370
 guilt is contrary to Article 18 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.340
 of the constitution of the 4th republic 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.960
 which states that anyone accused 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.690
 is innocent until his 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.940
 guilt was legally established 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.740
 before so many errors of justice 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.000
 Togolese several questions 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.910
 remain unanswered 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.850
 is justice independent in 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.590
 this case which has interest in that 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.450
 Bodjona is still in detention and 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.130
 Why 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.320
 until when the decision of the court of 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.950
 the justice of the cedeao remain in 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.229
 The drawers 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.979
 when does the paschal minister 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.930
 does bodjona cover have freedom alone 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.000
 Togolese justice whose 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.910
 modernization has cost billions of 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.940
 francs cfa can answer all these 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.940
 interrogations
