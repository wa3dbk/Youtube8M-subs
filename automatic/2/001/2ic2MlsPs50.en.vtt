occulta do mr. Locke who's forward

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
occulta do mr. Locke who's forward
that's<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.229> far<00:01:31.619> beyond<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.119> visor

will go even if I we should down hard so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
will go even if I we should down hard so
it<00:01:37.079> needs<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> bit<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> adjusting<00:01:37.979> first<00:01:38.850> thing

these two red things together and then
backwards<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.680> will<00:02:26.240> release<00:02:27.240> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
backwards and that will release this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.570 
backwards and that will release this
side<00:02:28.560> plate<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:34.250> not<00:02:35.250> supposed<00:02:35.520> to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
side plate there we go not supposed to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.860 
side plate there we go not supposed to
be<00:02:35.640> quite<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:35.970> violent<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.660> but

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
be quite as violent as that but

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.550 
be quite as violent as that but
essentially<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:37.680> you're<00:02:37.800> trying<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.390> is

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
essentially what you're trying to do is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.250 
essentially what you're trying to do is
push<00:02:40.560> those<00:02:40.830> two<00:02:41.130> together<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.820> then<00:02:42.600> back

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
push those two together and then back

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.490 
push those two together and then back
like<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.240> what<00:02:45.240> that<00:02:45.270> does<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.930> release<00:02:46.320> that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
like that what that does is release that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.610 
like that what that does is release that
bottom<00:02:46.860> bit<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.720> click<00:02:49.350> there

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
bottom bit and then that click there

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.520 
bottom bit and then that click there
comes<00:02:50.010> out<00:02:50.190> from<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.930> I'll<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> same

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
comes out from there so I'll do the same

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.410 
comes out from there so I'll do the same
on<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.920> other<00:02:52.950> side<00:02:54.950> okay<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:59.459> right<00:02:59.640> that's

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
on the other side okay the right that's

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.520 
on the other side okay the right that's
the<00:03:00.840> left<00:03:01.310> now<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.490> we<00:03:02.580> need<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.810> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the left now all we need to do is just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.680 
the left now all we need to do is just
grab<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.770> screwdriver<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.670> loosen<00:03:05.850> these<00:03:06.270> top

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
grab a screwdriver and loosen these top

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:19.300 
grab a screwdriver and loosen these top
two<00:03:07.220> screws<00:03:08.220> here

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.559

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
you don't need to loosen the bottom line

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.210 
you don't need to loosen the bottom line
just<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.660> bit<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.959> postscript<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.770> realize<00:03:25.069> I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
just a bit of a postscript I realize I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.300 
just a bit of a postscript I realize I
did<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.730> unscrew<00:03:26.270> these<00:03:27.040> bottom<00:03:28.040> ones<00:03:28.069> as

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
did have to unscrew these bottom ones as

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.930 
did have to unscrew these bottom ones as
well<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.790> give<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.420> whole<00:03:30.700> system<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
well to give the whole system the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.290 
well to give the whole system the
movement<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.569> needed<00:03:33.640> loosen<00:03:34.640> them<00:03:34.760> just

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
movement that it needed loosen them just

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:47.170 
movement that it needed loosen them just
a<00:03:35.360> little<00:03:35.390> bit<00:03:43.150> just<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.269> turn<00:03:44.780> or<00:03:44.959> two<00:03:45.670> then<00:03:46.670> we

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
a little bit just a turn or two then we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.259 
a little bit just a turn or two then we
replace<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.810> visor<00:03:53.920> okay<00:03:54.940> what<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.030> want<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
replace the visor okay what we want to

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.210 
replace the visor okay what we want to
do<00:03:56.420> one<00:03:57.380> side<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.890> time

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
do one side at a time

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.920 
do one side at a time
is<00:03:59.019> push<00:04:00.019> from<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.530> center<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.370> visor

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
is push from the center of the visor

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.979 
is push from the center of the visor
down<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.380> then<00:04:03.890> back<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.660> seals

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
down and then back so that it seals

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.820 
down and then back so that it seals
along<00:04:06.440> there<00:04:08.080> all<00:04:09.080> right<00:04:09.319> now<00:04:09.500> when<00:04:09.709> we've

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
along there all right now when we've

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:17.190 
along there all right now when we've
done<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.510> then<00:04:11.510> tighten<00:04:12.170> up<00:04:12.260> these<00:04:15.639> screws

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
done that then tighten up these screws

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.740 
done that then tighten up these screws
come<00:04:18.200> around<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.590> other<00:04:18.620> side<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.750> do

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
come around the other side and do

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.879 
come around the other side and do
exactly<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.290> same<00:04:21.350> thing

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
exactly the same thing

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.860 
exactly the same thing
we<00:04:22.250> should<00:04:22.550> have<00:04:23.110> theoretically<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:25.870> nice

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
we should have theoretically a nice

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.159 
we should have theoretically a nice
tight<00:04:27.229> fitting<00:04:28.030> visor<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.419> what<00:04:29.570> we<00:04:29.660> do<00:04:29.810> now<00:04:29.960> is

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
tight fitting visor so what we do now is

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.380 
tight fitting visor so what we do now is
put<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.620> plates<00:04:31.370> back<00:04:31.490> on<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.910> put<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.150> plates

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
put the plates back on so put the plates

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.500 
put the plates back on so put the plates
back<00:04:35.479> on<00:04:36.070> little<00:04:37.070> lovely<00:04:37.460> locate<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.270> just

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
back on little lovely locate that just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.570 
back on little lovely locate that just
in<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.660> top<00:04:41.200> and<00:04:42.200> make<00:04:42.410> sure<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.860> red<00:04:43.220> clip<00:04:43.430> is

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
in the top and make sure the red clip is

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.100 
in the top and make sure the red clip is
forwards<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.710> then<00:04:45.710> simply<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:47.570> good<00:04:47.750> access

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
forwards and then simply to good access

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:57.790 
forwards and then simply to good access
to<00:04:48.260> that<00:04:50.320> clip<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:54.400> then<00:04:55.400> make<00:04:55.610> sure<00:04:56.800> by

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
to that clip it in and then make sure by

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.510 
to that clip it in and then make sure by
doing<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.970> is<00:05:00.340> clipped<00:05:01.340> in

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
doing that that it is clipped in

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.820 
doing that that it is clipped in
securely<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.990> do<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.320> same<00:05:03.500> for<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.710> other

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
securely and do the same for the other

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.120 
securely and do the same for the other
side<00:05:04.010> make<00:05:04.220> sure<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.460> really<00:05:04.729> is<00:05:04.789> forwards

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
side make sure the really is forwards

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.300 
side make sure the really is forwards
the<00:05:07.130> lugs<00:05:07.370> located<00:05:09.250> press<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.400> down<00:05:10.900> click<00:05:11.900> and

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
the lugs located press it down click and

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.779 
the lugs located press it down click and
so<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.370> do<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> big<00:05:14.120> test<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.570> didn't<00:05:15.500> work

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.820 

there<00:05:19.789> we<00:05:19.910> go

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
there we go

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.370 
there we go
replace<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.979> visor<00:05:22.190> and<00:05:22.690> theoretically<00:05:26.380> it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
replace the visor and theoretically it

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.670 
replace the visor and theoretically it
should<00:05:27.440> work

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
should work

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:39.420 
should work
a<00:05:35.370> satisfying<00:05:36.370> clunk<00:05:36.940> when<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:38.070> when<00:05:39.070> I<00:05:39.100> close

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
a satisfying clunk when I when I close

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.249 
a satisfying clunk when I when I close
it<00:05:39.639> it's<00:05:39.789> eating<00:05:40.240> properly<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:40.900> let's<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:41.169> a

it it's eating properly so let's have a

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.990 
it it's eating properly so let's have a
look<00:05:41.470> okay<00:05:42.430> look<00:05:42.610> tiny<00:05:42.970> little<00:05:43.270> bit<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:45.000> they

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
look okay look tiny little bit of they

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.580 
look okay look tiny little bit of they
actually<00:05:46.389> know<00:05:46.539> there's<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.990> satisfying

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
actually know there's the satisfying

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.010 
actually know there's the satisfying
clunk<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.070> there's<00:05:48.729> the<00:05:48.910> satisfying
