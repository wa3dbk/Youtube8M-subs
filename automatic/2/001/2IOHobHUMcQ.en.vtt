if<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.560> turn<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.770> only<00:01:28.009> one<00:01:28.310> bulb<00:01:28.579> on<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
if you turn on only one bulb on the

if you turn on only one bulb on the
other<00:01:29.149> hand<00:01:29.390> then<00:01:30.079> you're<00:01:30.200> down<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.590> working

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
other hand then you're down to working

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.709 
other hand then you're down to working
at<00:01:31.009> f/2<00:01:31.429> so<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:31.939> really<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.179> pretty<00:01:32.450> nice

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
at f/2 so this is really a pretty nice

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.539 
at f/2 so this is really a pretty nice
range<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.649> makes<00:01:33.799> it<00:01:33.950> easy<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.250> get<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.399> nice

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
range and it makes it easy to get a nice

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.310 
range and it makes it easy to get a nice
pure<00:01:34.969> black<00:01:35.299> background<00:01:35.899> if<00:01:36.049> you're<00:01:36.170> into

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790

touch the sides of the softbox I had to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.230 
touch the sides of the softbox I had to
