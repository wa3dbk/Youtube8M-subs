the<00:00:41.430> camera<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the camera because I don't have like

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.569 
the camera because I don't have like
three<00:00:42.780> hands

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:01:07.340 

and<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:48.610> we<00:00:48.700> go

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 

as<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.790> left<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.210> has

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
as you can see like the left one has

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.600 
as you can see like the left one has
taken<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.140> longer<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
taken a little longer to actually get

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
taken a little longer to actually get
rebooted<00:01:12.770> but<00:01:13.770> amny<00:01:14.430> told<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.210> Desna

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
rebooted but amny told me that the Desna

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
rebooted but amny told me that the Desna
is<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.470> yet<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> desert<00:01:17.369> device<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> not

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is not yet or the desert device is not

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.070 
is not yet or the desert device is not
yet<00:01:18.090> optimized<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.840> way<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.310> am<00:01:20.780> dc50<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.899> on

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
yet optimized the way the am dc50 is on

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
yet optimized the way the am dc50 is on
the<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.390> pretty<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the right so it's pretty much about the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.100 
the right so it's pretty much about the
same<00:01:24.990> run<00:01:25.320> time<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:26.789> takes<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.420 

if<00:01:57.160> she<00:01:57.490> was<00:01:57.640> like<00:01:57.820> up<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> making

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.490 

so<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.610> 10<00:02:02.970> seconds<00:02:03.950> 15<00:02:04.950> about<00:02:05.640> 15<00:02:06.030> seconds

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
so that's 10 seconds 15 about 15 seconds

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.570 
so that's 10 seconds 15 about 15 seconds
all<00:02:07.500> right<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:07.920> we're<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> same

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
all right now we're gonna do the same

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.120 
all right now we're gonna do the same
thing<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> AMD<00:02:09.360> C<00:02:10.140> 50<00:02:10.470> base<00:02:10.649> blend<00:02:10.920> that's

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
thing on the AMD C 50 base blend that's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.040 
thing on the AMD C 50 base blend that's
right<00:02:11.430> next<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.819> ways<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.510> shut<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
right next to it ways on there shut it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.580 
right next to it ways on there shut it
off<00:02:13.140> first

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
off first

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.360 
off first
got<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> hold<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.940> second<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> next<00:02:17.190> up

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
got a hold this for a second so next up

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.790 
got a hold this for a second so next up
is<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.580> MDC<00:02:18.300> 50<00:02:18.660> based<00:02:18.900> iconia<00:02:19.410> tab<00:02:19.440> right

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
is the MDC 50 based iconia tab right

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:34.910 
is the MDC 50 based iconia tab right
here<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:22.950> go

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 

so<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.270> actually<00:02:36.540> pretty

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so as you can see that's actually pretty

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350 
so as you can see that's actually pretty
fast<00:02:37.230> too<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.890> about<00:02:38.100> 10<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.700> 15<00:02:39.030> seconds

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
fast too so it's about 10 to 15 seconds

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.780 
fast too so it's about 10 to 15 seconds
on<00:02:39.450> both<00:02:39.630> devices<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.260> still<00:02:40.500> worries<00:02:40.790> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
on both devices it still worries it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.000 
on both devices it still worries it
could<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.240> 30<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.900> some<00:02:42.930> certain<00:02:43.680> areas

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
could be up to 30 in some certain areas
