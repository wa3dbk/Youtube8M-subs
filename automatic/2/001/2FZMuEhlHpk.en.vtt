00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.379 
like I said a lot of them are just going
for<00:02:58.739> discard<00:02:59.159> prices<00:02:59.639> now<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.269> main

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
for discard prices now and the main

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.210 
for discard prices now and the main
reason<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.109> this<00:03:01.319> team<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.829> year

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
reason for that is this team of the year

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.360 
reason for that is this team of the year
is<00:03:02.340> gonna<00:03:02.819> crawl<00:03:03.209> calls<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.810> just<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.560> stupidly

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
is gonna crawl calls a just a stupidly

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610 
is gonna crawl calls a just a stupidly

off before the market crashed just

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.509 
off before the market crashed just

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.969 
anymore but let's say you know you get a
Ronaldo<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.019> there's<00:04:07.139> maybe<00:04:07.319> like<00:04:07.409> one<00:04:07.799> other

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
actually recommend selling it but I

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
actually recommend selling it but I
would<00:04:12.269> make<00:04:12.479> sure<00:04:12.509> if<00:04:13.379> someone<00:04:13.650> buys<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:13.949> they

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.029 
would make sure if someone buys it they
buy<00:04:14.579> it<00:04:14.639> for<00:04:14.939> a<00:04:15.000> stupidly<00:04:15.629> high<00:04:15.959> price<00:04:16.380> you

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
honest with you they were pretty

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.540 
honest with you they were pretty
terrible<00:05:05.500> packs<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.010> I<00:05:06.190> was<00:05:06.280> really

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
terrible packs and I was really

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.250 
terrible packs and I was really
questioning<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:07.090> should<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.360> spend<00:05:07.630> any<00:05:07.870> more<00:05:08.140> on

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
questioning I should I spend any more on

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.840 
questioning I should I spend any more on
the<00:05:08.380> packs<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.130> was<00:05:09.250> a<00:05:09.310> bit<00:05:09.460> like<00:05:09.610> it's

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
the packs and I was a bit like it's

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.220 
the packs and I was a bit like it's
probably<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.360> should<00:05:10.540> probably<00:05:10.690> just<00:05:10.990> put<00:05:11.050> it

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
probably I should probably just put it

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.930 
probably I should probably just put it
