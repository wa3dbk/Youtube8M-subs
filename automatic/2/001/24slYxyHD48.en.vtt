Hansel's<00:03:12.830> hand<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:14.660> added<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.110> fire<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.650> it

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
Hansel's hand and I added the fire to it

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.880 
Hansel's hand and I added the fire to it
to<00:03:16.850> try<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.209> make<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.540> look<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.110> he's<00:03:18.320> casting

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
to try to make it look like he's casting

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.910 
to try to make it look like he's casting
a<00:03:19.070> pyroblast<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.900> for<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> character<00:03:21.709> rigging

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
a pyroblast so for the character rigging

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.250 
a pyroblast so for the character rigging
I<00:03:22.220> plan<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.760> do<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> tutorial<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.750> character

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
I plan to do a tutorial on character

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.350 
I plan to do a tutorial on character
rigging<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.769> i'll<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.489> working<00:03:25.850> on<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.150> in

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
rigging and i'll be working on that in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.400 
rigging and i'll be working on that in
the<00:03:26.390> future<00:03:26.890> now<00:03:27.890> speaking<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.400> upscaling<00:03:29.030> i

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
the future now speaking of upscaling i

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.410 
the future now speaking of upscaling i
did<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.709> upscale<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.880> textures<00:03:32.390> that

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
did have to upscale the textures that

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.870 
did have to upscale the textures that
were<00:03:32.720> exported<00:03:33.110> from<00:03:33.410> wow<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.430> textures

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
were exported from wow so the textures

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.970 
were exported from wow so the textures
are<00:03:35.030> basically<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.720> pattern<00:03:36.440> that's<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
are basically the pattern that's on the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.220 
are basically the pattern that's on the
gear<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:38.090> what<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.269> did<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.600> smooth<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.049> the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
gear so what I did to smooth out the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.500 
gear so what I did to smooth out the
texture<00:03:39.590> was<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.890> took<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.370> texture<00:03:40.910> file<00:03:41.150> into

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
texture was I took the texture file into

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.850 
texture was I took the texture file into
Photoshop

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
Photoshop

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.450 
Photoshop
manually<00:03:43.660> traced<00:03:44.660> over<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.990> edges<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:46.190> try<00:03:46.400> to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
manually traced over the edges to try to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.700 
manually traced over the edges to try to
smooth<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.450> texture<00:03:47.870> out<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.110> little<00:03:48.380> bit<00:03:48.560> and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
smooth the texture out a little bit and

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.740 
smooth the texture out a little bit and
it<00:03:48.800> turns<00:03:48.980> out<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:49.280> works<00:03:49.640> really<00:03:49.940> well<00:03:50.060> to

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
it turns out this works really well to

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.320 
it turns out this works really well to
get<00:03:50.900> rid<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.290> jaggedy<00:03:51.860> pixely<00:03:52.520> artifacts

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
get rid of that jaggedy pixely artifacts

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.360 
get rid of that jaggedy pixely artifacts
that<00:03:54.550> result<00:03:55.550> from<00:03:55.730> upscaling<00:03:56.510> an<00:03:56.720> image<00:03:57.370> so

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that result from upscaling an image so

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.830 
that result from upscaling an image so
let's<00:03:58.550> take<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.760> look<00:03:58.970> at<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.150> workflow<00:03:59.630> in

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
let's take a look at the workflow in

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.780 
let's take a look at the workflow in
adobe<00:04:00.230> after<00:04:00.530> effects<00:04:00.830> after<00:04:01.040> all<00:04:01.460> of<00:04:01.670> these

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
adobe after effects after all of these

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.230 
adobe after effects after all of these
files<00:04:02.120> are<00:04:02.530> exported<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.680> 4k<00:04:04.460> resolution<00:04:05.030> from

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
files are exported in 4k resolution from

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.840 
files are exported in 4k resolution from
cinema<00:04:05.540> 4d<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.140> bring<00:04:06.710> them<00:04:06.860> into<00:04:07.130> After

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
cinema 4d I bring them into After

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.180 
cinema 4d I bring them into After
Effects<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:09.410> I'm<00:04:09.500> going<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.680> do<00:04:09.830> in<00:04:09.920> After

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
Effects what I'm going to do in After

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.640 
Effects what I'm going to do in After
Effects<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.580> I'm<00:04:10.730> gonna<00:04:10.820> adjust<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:12.380> color

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
Effects is I'm gonna adjust the color

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.190 
Effects is I'm gonna adjust the color
the<00:04:13.280> brightness<00:04:13.790> I'm<00:04:14.330> gonna<00:04:14.570> do<00:04:14.750> some<00:04:14.930> color

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the brightness I'm gonna do some color

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.590 
the brightness I'm gonna do some color
grading<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.010> here<00:04:16.940> i<00:04:16.970> adjust<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.480> exposure

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
grading and here i adjust the exposure

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.740 
grading and here i adjust the exposure
the<00:04:18.320> curves<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.010> color<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:20.359> make<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.600> look

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
the curves the color to make it look

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.790 
the curves the color to make it look
like<00:04:21.130> Hansel's<00:04:22.130> really<00:04:22.550> casting<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.180> pyroblast

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
like Hansel's really casting a pyroblast

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.130 
like Hansel's really casting a pyroblast
another<00:04:24.800> thing<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.190> do<00:04:25.250> here<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:26.140> time

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
another thing I do here is time

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.720 
another thing I do here is time
remapping<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:27.950> want<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.190> do<00:04:28.280> some<00:04:28.460> slow

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
remapping so I want to do some slow

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.420 
remapping so I want to do some slow
motion<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.690> remember<00:04:30.169> when<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.010> watch<00:04:31.190> the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
motion you remember when you watch the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.240 
motion you remember when you watch the
intro<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:32.690> see<00:04:32.870> Hansel<00:04:33.140> spin<00:04:33.650> around<00:04:33.770> it's

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
intro you see Hansel spin around it's

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.100 
intro you see Hansel spin around it's
like<00:04:34.400> he's<00:04:34.580> charging<00:04:35.210> up<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:35.570> pyroblast

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
like he's charging up this pyroblast

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.800 
like he's charging up this pyroblast
he's<00:04:36.830> about<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.250> release<00:04:37.580> right<00:04:37.970> his<00:04:38.360> arm<00:04:38.690> is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
he's about to release right his arm is

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.530 
he's about to release right his arm is
cocked<00:04:39.110> back<00:04:39.380> elbow<00:04:40.250> forward<00:04:40.580> he's<00:04:41.240> about<00:04:41.390> to

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
cocked back elbow forward he's about to

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.450 
cocked back elbow forward he's about to
launch<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.960> pyroblast<00:04:42.410> into<00:04:42.830> somebody's<00:04:43.190> face

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
launch a pyroblast into somebody's face

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.310 
launch a pyroblast into somebody's face
and<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.090> want<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.390> drop<00:04:44.630> it<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.050> slow<00:04:45.290> motion

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
and I want to drop it in a slow motion

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.130 
and I want to drop it in a slow motion
right<00:04:45.890> here<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> do<00:04:47.330> some<00:04:47.540> time<00:04:47.750> remapping

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
right here so I do some time remapping

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.530 
right here so I do some time remapping
here<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:49.430> can<00:04:49.550> check<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.850> information<00:04:49.970> about

this<00:05:02.870> yourself<00:05:03.290> I<00:05:03.500> also<00:05:03.950> use<00:05:04.160> some<00:05:04.280> glitch

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
this yourself I also use some glitch

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.000 
this yourself I also use some glitch
effects<00:05:04.910> which<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.630> kind<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:05.870> become<00:05:06.169> a<00:05:06.410> sign

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
effects which is kind of become a sign
