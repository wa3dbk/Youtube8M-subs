you can see we have two different wheel
sizes<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.400> 26<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.900> 29<00:00:10.759> for<00:00:11.759> 2014<00:00:12.719> there's

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
sizes the 26 and the 29 for 2014 there's

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.660 
sizes the 26 and the 29 for 2014 there's
not<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> whole<00:00:13.679> lot<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.860> changes<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
not a whole lot of changes to the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.630 
not a whole lot of changes to the
chassis<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.360> updated<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.900> enduros<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.640> 2013

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
chassis we updated the enduros in 2013

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
chassis we updated the enduros in 2013
so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.480> idea<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> still<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> same<00:00:19.380> all

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
so the idea is still the same all

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.820 
so the idea is still the same all

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the really cool pieces that we've worked

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.270 
the really cool pieces that we've worked
on<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.850> lot<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.780> introduced<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.530> 29<00:00:59.039> bike

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
on a lot when we introduced this 29 bike

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.910 
on a lot when we introduced this 29 bike
this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.600> particularly<00:01:00.989> tricky<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.710> get

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this one was particularly tricky to get

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030 
this one was particularly tricky to get
a<00:01:02.129> 29<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.480> such<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> short<00:01:04.110> rear<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a 29 to have such a short rear in this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.960 
a 29 to have such a short rear in this
is<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> 430<00:01:06.210> millimeter<00:01:07.189> chainstay<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is a 430 millimeter chainstay which is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
is a 430 millimeter chainstay which is
crazy<00:01:09.689> short<00:01:10.170> especially<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> two<00:01:11.220> niner

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
crazy short especially for a two niner

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.380 
crazy short especially for a two niner
with<00:01:12.060> 155<00:01:12.840> millimetres<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> travel<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.390> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
with 155 millimetres to travel so we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.880 
with 155 millimetres to travel so we
didn't<00:01:15.630> change<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> seat<00:01:16.229> state<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> see

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
didn't change the seat state you can see

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.289 
didn't change the seat state you can see
we<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> drop<00:01:17.460> seat<00:01:17.729> state<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
we have a drop seat state here this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
we have a drop seat state here this
gives<00:01:18.509> us<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> clearance<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.130> need<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
gives us the clearance that we need to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.870 
gives us the clearance that we need to
get<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> travel<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.549> new<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
get all that travel and new for this
