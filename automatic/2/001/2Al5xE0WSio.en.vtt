00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.690 
happy with we did about hundred shots
for<00:02:18.310> four<00:02:18.550> lobby<00:02:18.730> sequence<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:21.430> looked

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
for four lobby sequence and they looked

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.040 
for four lobby sequence and they looked
very<00:02:21.820> straightforward<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.690> beginning

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
very straightforward at the beginning

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.640 
very straightforward at the beginning
but<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:24.400> everything<00:02:24.760> else<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.240> just<00:02:25.500> has<00:02:26.500> its

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
but as everything else it just has its

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.160 
but as everything else it just has its
own<00:02:26.770> challenges<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.910> face<00:02:28.239> as<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.989> go

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
own challenges that we face as we go

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.080 
own challenges that we face as we go
through<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.640> biggest<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.060> was

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
through one of the the biggest one was

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.120 
through one of the the biggest one was
probably<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.780> creative<00:02:32.500> challenging<00:02:32.920> how<00:02:33.070> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
probably the creative challenging how to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.410 
probably the creative challenging how to
to<00:02:33.610> make<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.910> believable<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.600> scale<00:02:34.870> that

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to make it believable on that scale that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.780 
to make it believable on that scale that
it's<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:38.310> megacity<00:02:40.709> environment<00:02:41.790> with

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
it's one megacity environment with

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.610 
it's one megacity environment with
enormous<00:02:43.090> scale<00:02:43.420> again<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.260> not

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
enormous scale again that's it's not

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.220 
enormous scale again that's it's not
available<00:02:45.459> as<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.300> reference<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.930> your<00:02:47.080> real

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
life and nothing you can refer to we

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.530 
life and nothing you can refer to we
worked<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.280> closely<00:02:51.550> with<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.090> Rutland

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
worked really closely with the Rutland

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.509 
worked really closely with the Rutland
and<00:02:52.690> Peter<00:02:52.900> Chang<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.500> once<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.160> found<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
and Peter Chang and once we found that

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.550 
and Peter Chang and once we found that
they<00:02:54.700> looking<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.390> established<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they looking and established that the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.880 
they looking and established that the
sequence<00:02:57.750> everything<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:59.080> got<00:02:59.290> much<00:02:59.440> easier

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
sequence everything just got much easier

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.979 
sequence everything just got much easier
there<00:03:00.310> was<00:03:00.400> another<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.760> challenges<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.330> China

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
there was another of challenges in China

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.970 
there was another of challenges in China
for<00:03:02.200> sequence<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.750> faced<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.620> varied

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
for sequence that we faced that varied

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.030 
for sequence that we faced that varied
from<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.489> layout<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.209> our<00:03:07.450> scene<00:03:07.989> Bay<00:03:08.230> where<00:03:08.590> we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
from a layout to our scene Bay where we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.420 
from a layout to our scene Bay where we
had<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.579> deal<00:03:09.760> with<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.350> 20-plus<00:03:11.350> cincin<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
had to deal with the 20-plus cincin and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.449 
had to deal with the 20-plus cincin and
again<00:03:13.150> extreme<00:03:13.480> rendering<00:03:13.840> time<00:03:14.049> and

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
again extreme rendering time and

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.890 
again extreme rendering time and
extremely<00:03:15.459> accurate<00:03:15.579> reflections<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.630> they

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
extremely accurate reflections that they

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.650 
extremely accurate reflections that they
were<00:03:16.959> required<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.070> sci-fi<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.790> aspects

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
were required the the sci-fi of aspects

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
were required the the sci-fi of aspects
of<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.140> movie<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.739> an<00:03:21.010> ability<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.880> be

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
of the of the movie and an ability to be

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
creatively involved on that scale is

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.449 
creatively involved on that scale is
it's<00:03:25.870> absolutely<00:03:26.440> tremendous<00:03:26.620> experience

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
it's absolutely tremendous experience
