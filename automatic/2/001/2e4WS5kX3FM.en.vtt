that has on it is a control like this
you<00:00:10.950> know<00:00:11.099> no<00:00:11.370> digital<00:00:11.610> nothing<00:00:12.300> just<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.809> knob

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
you know no digital nothing just a knob

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.779 
you know no digital nothing just a knob
to<00:00:13.679> control<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.700> cooling<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:16.010> a<00:00:17.010> switch<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to control the cooling and a switch to

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.060 
to control the cooling and a switch to
turn<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.750> switch<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.380> control<00:00:19.859> the

turn it on and a switch to control the
fan<00:00:20.250> speed<00:00:20.670> okay<00:00:21.390> well<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:23.039> figured

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
fan speed okay well I actually figured

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700 
fan speed okay well I actually figured
out<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.240> simpler<00:00:24.720> than<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.109> sounds<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
out it's a lot simpler than it sounds to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
out it's a lot simpler than it sounds to
hook<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.840> central<00:00:27.840> air<00:00:28.019> conditioner

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
hook up a central air conditioner

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.030 
hook up a central air conditioner
thermostat<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.869> not<00:00:30.869> five<00:00:31.170> minutes<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
thermostat to it not five minutes but it

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.740 
thermostat to it not five minutes but it
is<00:00:32.189> pretty<00:00:32.430> simple<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
is pretty simple you just have to have a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
is pretty simple you just have to have a
basic<00:00:34.260> soldering<00:00:34.469> skills<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.520> some

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
basic soldering skills and some

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.959 
basic soldering skills and some
electrical<00:00:36.480> knowledge<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.170> you'd<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.410> good

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
electrical knowledge and you'd be good

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.680 
electrical knowledge and you'd be good
if<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.480> buy<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
if you're going to go out buy a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.830 
if you're going to go out buy a
thermostat<00:00:40.219> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.550> prefer<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.450> makes<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
thermostat and I prefer that it makes a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
thermostat and I prefer that it makes a
lot<00:00:43.020> easier<00:00:44.840> 24<00:00:45.840> volt<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.500> milli<00:00:47.190> volt

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
lot easier 24 volt and milli volt

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.299 
lot easier 24 volt and milli volt
systems<00:00:48.000> AC<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:48.870> battery<00:00:49.230> power<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.160> use

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
systems AC or battery power not for use

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.930 
systems AC or battery power not for use
of<00:00:50.520> 110<00:00:51.180> volt<00:00:51.420> systems<00:00:51.949> well<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> 110

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
of 110 volt systems well this is a 110

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.439 
of 110 volt systems well this is a 110
volt<00:00:54.000> system<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> did<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.149> go<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
volt system so all I did was go out to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.880 
volt system so all I did was go out to
RadioShack<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> buy<00:00:58.379> two<00:00:58.440> 10<00:00:59.160> amp<00:00:59.370> relays<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
RadioShack and buy two 10 amp relays the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
RadioShack and buy two 10 amp relays the
relays<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.870> wired<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
relays are wired to the the the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.760 
relays are wired to the the the
thermostat<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.729> yellow<00:01:09.500> control<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
thermostat here the yellow control is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
thermostat here the yellow control is
for<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.600> compressor<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.950> green<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
for the the compressor and the green is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.200 
for the the compressor and the green is
for<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> fans<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.530> relay<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.970> wire

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
for the fans so one relay you just wire

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.109 
for the fans so one relay you just wire
into<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> system<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.680> actual<00:01:20.189> power<00:01:20.610> system

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
into the system the actual power system

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.830 
into the system the actual power system
of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> air<00:01:22.290> conditioner<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:24.270> wire<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of the air conditioner and you wire that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.140 
of the air conditioner and you wire that
to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> fans<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.790> wire<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> other

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to the fans and then you wire the other

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.370 
to the fans and then you wire the other
one<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> compressor<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.170> then<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
one to the the compressor and then you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.850 
one to the the compressor and then you
just<00:01:31.590> hook<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.840> your<00:01:33.840> thermostat<00:01:34.439> system

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
just hook up your your thermostat system

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.600 
just hook up your your thermostat system
to<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> 9<00:01:36.750> volt<00:01:37.079> DC<00:01:37.380> adapter<00:01:38.220> that's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to I just got a 9 volt DC adapter that's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.020 
to I just got a 9 volt DC adapter that's
good<00:01:39.240> enough<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> trigger<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> relays<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
good enough to trigger the relays and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.950 
good enough to trigger the relays and
then<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.119> figure<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.720> color

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
then you figure out what your color

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
then you figure out what your color
codes<00:01:43.259> mean<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.840> get<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> hooked<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
codes mean and you get it hooked up so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.510 
codes mean and you get it hooked up so
basically<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.750> turn<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
basically if I turn it on with the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
basically if I turn it on with the
cooling<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> fans<00:01:52.680> come<00:01:52.950> on

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
cooling off just the fans come on

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.819 
cooling off just the fans come on
so<00:01:56.020> they're<00:01:56.170> just<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.469> fans<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:59.200> 75

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
so they're just a fans and it's 75

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.319 
so they're just a fans and it's 75
degrees<00:01:59.860> in<00:02:00.219> here<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.789> oh<00:02:00.969> and<00:02:01.180> by<00:02:01.299> the

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
degrees in here this is oh and by the

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.880 
degrees in here this is oh and by the
way<00:02:01.450> since<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.110> mounting<00:02:02.439> here<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.649> just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
way since this is mounting here I just

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.310 
way since this is mounting here I just
to<00:02:03.429> keep<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.759> wind<00:02:04.210> chill<00:02:04.479> from<00:02:04.780> affecting

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
to keep the wind chill from affecting

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.830 
to keep the wind chill from affecting
the<00:02:05.439> thermostat<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.219> put<00:02:06.729> some<00:02:06.969> duct<00:02:07.240> tape<00:02:07.329> or<00:02:07.780> a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
the thermostat I put some duct tape or a

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.610 
the thermostat I put some duct tape or a
gorilla<00:02:08.259> tape<00:02:08.590> here<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:10.509> put<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.140> lot<00:02:11.410> of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
gorilla tape here and I put a lot of

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.860 
gorilla tape here and I put a lot of
sticky<00:02:12.250> tack<00:02:12.459> around<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:13.000> temperature<00:02:13.599> probe

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.809 
sticky tack around a temperature probe
just<00:02:13.900> insulate<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.190> bit<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.670> way

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
just insulate it a little bit that way

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.720 
just insulate it a little bit that way
it<00:02:15.940> won't<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.180> affected<00:02:16.540> by<00:02:16.630> wind<00:02:16.750> show

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
it won't be affected by wind show

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.990 
it won't be affected by wind show
so<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.840> click<00:02:20.049> cool<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:21.340> shows<00:02:21.610> that's<00:02:21.819> going

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so if I click cool it shows that's going

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.589 
so if I click cool it shows that's going
to<00:02:22.060> cold<00:02:22.269> 74<00:02:23.519> 75<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.030> clicks<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
to cold 74 75 so it clicks on the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.320 
to cold 74 75 so it clicks on the
compressor<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.349> fans<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.880> other<00:02:28.030> fan

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
compressor and the fans the other fan

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.559 
compressor and the fans the other fan
out<00:02:28.569> there<00:02:29.430> outside<00:02:30.430> gets<00:02:31.090> clicked<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.769> and

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
out there outside gets clicked on to and

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.280 
out there outside gets clicked on to and
it's<00:02:34.569> working<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.530> could<00:02:35.680> click<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> off

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
it's working so you could click it off

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.240 
it's working so you could click it off
compressor<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.440> fan<00:02:38.620> turn<00:02:38.860> off<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.130> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
compressor in the fan turn off but you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.650 
compressor in the fan turn off but you
can<00:02:39.370> keep<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.700> fans<00:02:39.940> running<00:02:40.180> without<00:02:40.420> -

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
can keep the fans running without -

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.680 
can keep the fans running without -
compressor<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.880> think<00:02:43.150> that's<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.540> lot

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
compressor and I just think that's a lot

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.110 
compressor and I just think that's a lot
better<00:02:43.930> than<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.170> little<00:02:44.880> crappy<00:02:45.880> ass

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
better than that little crappy ass

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.030 
better than that little crappy ass
control<00:02:46.660> they<00:02:46.810> give<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.140> here

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
control they give you here

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.729 
control they give you here
so<00:02:48.579> yeah<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:49.060> pretty<00:02:49.120> simple<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.650> you

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
so yeah it's pretty simple and if you

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.140 
so yeah it's pretty simple and if you
want<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.980> do<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.190> go<00:02:51.250> ahead<00:02:51.640> do<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.030> at<00:02:52.120> your
