 Construction drawings create ours 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 engineers the production plans 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.360

 room design window installation situation 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 also later on the construction site 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.159
 everything starts with the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.500
 used 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.299
 Now the windows follow through the high 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.070
 technical degree of prefabrication can be 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.060
 Window very compliant 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.009
 to be built in 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 This results in a high degree of functionality 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.710
 and excellent heat protection 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.710
 reached

 the construction site is allowed 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.200
 depending on the size and individuality of the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.239
 house will need between three and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.099
 five days to finish a house 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.050
 Cover and roof are now loaded 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.880
 and driven to their construction site 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 there are the components of then 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.460
 our assembly professionals professionally
