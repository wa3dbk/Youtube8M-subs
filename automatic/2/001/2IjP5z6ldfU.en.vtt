00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
else I think this is one of those cars

else I think this is one of those cars
let's<00:00:26.060> take<00:00:26.180> a<00:00:26.210> walk<00:00:26.449> around<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:26.869> see<00:00:26.900> some<00:00:27.260> of

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
let's take a walk around you see some of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.689 
let's take a walk around you see some of
the<00:00:27.410> performance<00:00:27.859> items<00:00:28.160> that<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.340> on<00:00:28.430> here

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
the performance items that are on here

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.339 
the performance items that are on here
and<00:00:28.880> some<00:00:29.330> of<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.480> quality<00:00:29.929> that<00:00:29.960> went<00:00:30.199> into

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
and some of the quality that went into

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.589 
and some of the quality that went into
it<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:31.580> think<00:00:31.699> you'll<00:00:32.000> find<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.330> to<00:00:32.449> be

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
it and I think you'll find it to be

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.889 
it and I think you'll find it to be
pretty<00:00:33.079> spectacular<00:00:33.350> more<00:00:34.130> importantly<00:00:34.899> you

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
pretty spectacular more importantly you

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:36.910 
pretty spectacular more importantly you
know<00:00:35.989> we<00:00:36.050> have<00:00:36.140> some<00:00:36.260> great<00:00:36.410> receipts<00:00:36.770> with

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
know we have some great receipts with

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.280 
know we have some great receipts with
the<00:00:37.040> car<00:00:37.250> it's<00:00:37.760> only<00:00:37.880> had<00:00:38.030> 5500<00:00:38.840> miles<00:00:38.989> on<00:00:39.260> it

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
the car it's only had 5500 miles on it

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.590 
the car it's only had 5500 miles on it
since<00:00:39.530> it<00:00:39.649> was<00:00:39.680> totally<00:00:40.160> restored<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:40.879> I

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
since it was totally restored and I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.770 
since it was totally restored and I
think<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.250> in<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:43.430> world<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.850> fast<00:00:44.450> cars

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
think that in the world of fast cars

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.139 
think that in the world of fast cars
that<00:00:45.230> are<00:00:45.410> semi<00:00:45.860> sleepers<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:46.789> is<00:00:46.910> one<00:00:47.059> of

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
that are semi sleepers this is one of

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.279 
that are semi sleepers this is one of
those<00:00:47.270> cars<00:00:47.510> let's<00:00:47.750> start<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.110> paint

for instance this car is completely
disassembled<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:50.780> repainted<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:51.379> on<00:00:51.469> top<00:00:51.649> of

here<00:01:27.350> these<00:01:27.680> are<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.920> Cobra<00:01:28.250> style<00:01:28.460> rims<00:01:28.820> with

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
here these are the Cobra style rims with

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.999 
here these are the Cobra style rims with
not<00:01:29.360> cheap<00:01:29.600> tire<00:01:29.810> zones<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.200> Dunlop's<00:01:30.650> on<00:01:30.860> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
not cheap tire zones that Dunlop's on it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.190 
not cheap tire zones that Dunlop's on it
and<00:01:31.189> I<00:01:31.610> think<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:31.909> really<00:01:32.119> first<00:01:32.930> off<00:01:33.079> they

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and I think they really first off they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600 
and I think they really first off they
fit<00:01:33.439> beautifully<00:01:33.650> inside<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.340> car<00:01:34.520> and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
fit beautifully inside the car and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.270 
fit beautifully inside the car and
secondly<00:01:35.170> they<00:01:36.170> add<00:01:36.350> just<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.770> little<00:01:37.040> touch<00:01:37.250> of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
secondly they add just a little touch of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.039 
secondly they add just a little touch of
the<00:01:37.460> performance<00:01:37.909> factor<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.329> having<00:01:38.689> huge

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
the performance factor that having huge

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.620 
the performance factor that having huge
playing<00:01:39.409> wheels<00:01:39.650> on<00:01:39.860> there<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:41.030> will<00:01:41.540> let

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
playing wheels on there that will let

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.270 
playing wheels on there that will let
you<00:01:41.750> know<00:01:41.869> maybe<00:01:42.049> something<00:01:42.470> is<00:01:42.590> extra<00:01:42.979> under

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
you know maybe something is extra under

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.100 
you know maybe something is extra under
the<00:01:43.399> hood<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.210> extra<00:01:44.509> under<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> hood<00:01:44.990> is

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
the hood but extra under the hood is

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.300 
the hood but extra under the hood is
really<00:01:45.259> why<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.560> would<00:01:45.740> buy<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:45.950> car

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
really why you would buy this car

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.179 
really why you would buy this car
because<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.790> drivetrain<00:01:47.619> has<00:01:48.619> quite<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.979> bit

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
because the drivetrain has quite a bit

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.469 
because the drivetrain has quite a bit
tied<00:01:49.369> up<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:49.790> let's<00:01:49.970> take<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.149> peek<00:01:50.240> at

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
tied up in it so let's take a peek at

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.300 
tied up in it so let's take a peek at
that<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.990> know<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.110> love<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.590> styling<00:01:51.890> here

that you know I love the styling here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.490 
that you know I love the styling here

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
the way they bake before it came and

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.910 
the way they bake before it came and

changing these Fox Body Mustangs with
the<00:01:58.009> headlights<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.490> way<00:01:58.610> they<00:01:58.729> are<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.180> flat

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
the headlights the way they are the flat

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.330 
the headlights the way they are the flat
black<00:01:59.719> stripes<00:02:00.140> down<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.409> hood<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.159> know<00:02:01.189> it

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
black stripes down the hood you know it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.490 
black stripes down the hood you know it
was<00:02:01.460> an<00:02:01.610> era<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.149> during<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.899> era<00:02:03.170> that's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
was an era and during that era that's

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.050 
was an era and during that era that's
kind<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.159> how<00:02:04.250> they<00:02:04.369> carried<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:04.969> I

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
kind of how they carried that but I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.850 
kind of how they carried that but I
think<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.659> know<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.229> think<00:02:06.350> it's<00:02:06.560> weathered

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
think that I know I think it's weathered

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.140 
think that I know I think it's weathered
the<00:02:07.899> storm<00:02:08.899> well<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:09.229> far<00:02:09.440> as<00:02:09.940> style<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the storm well as far as style and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.699 
the storm well as far as style and
design<00:02:11.270> go<00:02:11.599> okay<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.110> let's<00:02:12.319> look<00:02:12.410> under<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
design go okay so let's look under the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.830 
design go okay so let's look under the
hood<00:02:12.800> for<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.010> second<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.459> first

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
this car for yourself not a car that you

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.930 
this car for yourself not a car that you
would<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.260> flip<00:02:38.530> into<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.310> get<00:02:39.459> rid<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> but

ceramic coated Bassani headers that we

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.069 
ceramic coated Bassani headers that we
talked<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.220> about<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.540> all<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.870> chrome

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
talked to you about and all the chrome

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.180 
talked to you about and all the chrome
and<00:02:47.110> fill<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.560> under<00:02:47.739> here<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> air

and fill it under here the air
conditioning<00:02:48.700> still<00:02:48.940> works<00:02:48.970> though<00:02:49.390> which<00:02:49.569> is

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
conditioning still works though which is

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.819 
conditioning still works though which is
kind<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.959> nice<00:02:50.079> because<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> makes<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
kind of nice because then it makes the

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.800 
kind of nice because then it makes the
