welcome<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.110> third<00:00:01.469> part<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.770> this

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
welcome to the third part of this

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.610 
welcome to the third part of this
tutorial<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.610> buffer<00:00:03.210> calculations<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
tutorial on buffer calculations so the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.010 
tutorial on buffer calculations so the
first<00:00:04.830> part<00:00:05.100> was<00:00:05.790> calculating<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.509> pH<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
first part was calculating the pH of a

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.379 
first part was calculating the pH of a
buffer<00:00:07.049> then<00:00:08.010> adding<00:00:08.820> some<00:00:08.849> HCl<00:00:09.269> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
buffer then adding some HCl and

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.360 
buffer then adding some HCl and
calculating<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.230> pH<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.130> part

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
calculating the new pH and this part

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.650 
calculating the new pH and this part
we're<00:00:11.460> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> compare<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.269> adding

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
we're going to compare that with adding

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.950 
we're going to compare that with adding
HCl<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.679> water<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.240> part<00:00:15.570> we

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
HCl to water so in the first part we

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.439 
HCl to water so in the first part we
calculated<00:00:16.410> four<00:00:16.680> point<00:00:16.920> seven<00:00:17.160> five<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
calculated four point seven five as the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.080 
calculated four point seven five as the
buffer<00:00:19.380> pH<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.520> went<00:00:20.670> down<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> four

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
buffer pH then that went down to four

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.790 
buffer pH then that went down to four
point<00:00:21.300> six<00:00:21.510> six<00:00:21.689> when<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.020> added<00:00:22.140> some<00:00:22.410> acid

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
point six six when we added some acid

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.470 
point six six when we added some acid
and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.789> third<00:00:23.970> part<00:00:24.000> we're<00:00:24.359> going

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and then in this third part we're going

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.210 
and then in this third part we're going
to<00:00:24.539> add<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> same<00:00:24.960> amount<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.380> acid<00:00:25.710> ten

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to add the same amount of acid ten

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
to add the same amount of acid ten
centimeter<00:00:26.730> cubed<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.510> per

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
centimeter cubed of one more per

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870 
centimeter cubed of one more per
decimeter<00:00:27.900> cubed<00:00:28.289> HCl<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.760> we're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
decimeter cubed HCl but this time we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
decimeter cubed HCl but this time we're
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.090> add<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.599> 1<00:00:30.869> decimeter<00:00:31.289> cubed<00:00:31.619> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
going to add it to 1 decimeter cubed of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.490 
going to add it to 1 decimeter cubed of
water<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.430> find<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> pH<00:00:33.989> change

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
water and find out what the pH change

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
water and find out what the pH change
will<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> assume<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.420> pH

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
will be I'm going to assume that the pH

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
will be I'm going to assume that the pH
of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.739> water<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.370> temperature<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
1 decimeter cubed of water so we can

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
work out the concentration we're going

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
work out the concentration we're going
to<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> amount<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.120> then<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> total

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to use that amount and then the total

decimeter<00:01:08.880> cubed<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.450> originally<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
decimeter cubed here originally then we

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.670 
decimeter cubed here originally then we
added<00:01:10.560> 10<00:01:10.860> centimeter<00:01:11.400> cubed<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.680> HCL

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
added 10 centimeter cubed of the HCL

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020 
added 10 centimeter cubed of the HCL
that<00:01:13.799> small<00:01:14.010> amounts<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.430> gives<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that small amounts which gives you just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020 
that small amounts which gives you just
over<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> decimeter<00:01:15.810> cubed<00:01:16.490> 1010<00:01:17.490> centimeter

over a decimeter cubed 1010 centimeter

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
over a decimeter cubed 1010 centimeter
cubed<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> work<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> H+

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
cubed so to work out the H+

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
cubed so to work out the H+
concentration<00:01:20.060> amount<00:01:21.060> divided<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.689> volume

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
concentration amount divided by volume

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.050 
concentration amount divided by volume
and<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.710> comes<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.280> nine<00:01:23.549> point<00:01:23.880> nine

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and that comes out as nine point nine

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 
and that comes out as nine point nine

times ten to the minus three moles per
decimeter<00:01:26.580> cubed<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> work<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> pH

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
decimeter cubed so to work out the pH

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.060 
decimeter cubed so to work out the pH
then<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.060> pH<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.079> equal<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.409> minus<00:01:31.799> log<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
then we do pH is equal to minus log of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
then we do pH is equal to minus log of
H+<00:01:32.549> concentration<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.360> minus<00:01:33.750> log<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> nine

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

point nine zero times ten to the minus

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.080 
point nine zero times ten to the minus
three<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.659> gives<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.930> value<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.820> if

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
three which gives a value of two so if

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 
three which gives a value of two so if
we<00:01:39.650> compare<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.970> buffer<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.360> saw<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
we compare that to the buffer we saw in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.969 
we compare that to the buffer we saw in
the<00:01:42.659> buffer<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.110> went<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.770> slightly

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the buffer that went down just slightly

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
the buffer that went down just slightly
