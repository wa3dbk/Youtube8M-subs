00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.899
 And then people to the beauty that is talking 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.269
 Juan, how are you? Welcome. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 to another video and in this new video of this 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.990
 new channel d series gta5 i want 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.660
 basically show unusual locations 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.850
 whether they're hiding local secrets 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 behind doors in which you do not even 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 I figured I could go in there and have 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.480
 places that many people know 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 because they are already stained 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 but my intention is to show everyone 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.829
 from the one everyone knows 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 even the new ones because you know the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.300
 rockstar every update she puts 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 more things on sunday 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 besides the content of the adele c it places 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.579
 new easter eggs and maybe even local 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.250
 new unlocking doors 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.149
 I hope you like it and we'll go 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.149
 go to video 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.899
 In this first episode I want to show 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.200
 for you guys 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.780
 The clock tower is very nice. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.539
 in this location you are seeing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.819
 on the screen and she's really cool because 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.369
 face is this watch it is really from 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.929
 True, it's time to game you. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.240
 you can even compare it when you get there 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.270
 Up the time of your cell phone for you. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.439
 it's really cool 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 Unfortunately you can not see exactly 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.270
 As clock works, you can not enter. 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.119
 inside that gear and that would be 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.700
 well cool goes down but still worth it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.759
 visit and just to get me out of that self 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.060
 Nice to leave there in your own 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.060
 gallery 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.320
 It's a funny thing that happens in this 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 place is what you are seeing there that 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.570
 door was torn from the league where she 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 I was and if you 're going to start taking it 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.860
 there is no hole 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.960
 his physics game is going to give a lawyer 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.850
 and it will appear as if she had the 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.670
 force alienate that it has been plucked 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.190
 Why do you start to get started? 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.730
 to break into li yong the door 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.640
 would be in thesis is a mistake well everyone with 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 but finally a curiosity and also about 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.360
 this location 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.940
 and as you can see it is really the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.090
 game time you can see there 10 and 38 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.030
 39 10 and 40 and really the clock goes 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.680
 changing as time goes by is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.799
 It's really nice of you to see how 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.470
 rockstar she really gives attention to every 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.870
 game from the smallest to the 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.709
 tension is greater than graph and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.900
 texture 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.870
 for you to see how rockstar is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.209
 really fucking expensive then it guys 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.220
 this clock tower idea does not have 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.650
 much to where else is basically a 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.920
 building with that clock up there 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.959
 that part of the clock is also 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.610
 It's really cool for you to visit your friends. 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.379
 in an online mode in story mode 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.450
 also gives more is obvious that in the 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.790
 online much more fun 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.010
