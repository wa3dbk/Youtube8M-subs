00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
when you're actually packing is to

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.800 
when you're actually packing is to
actually<00:03:47.799> roll<00:03:48.099> your<00:03:48.430> items<00:03:48.849> if<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.419> roll

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
actually roll your items if you roll

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.140 
actually roll your items if you roll
your<00:03:50.079> items<00:03:50.530> up<00:03:50.799> you're<00:03:51.159> going<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.699> able<00:03:51.819> to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
your items up you're going to be able to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.289 
your items up you're going to be able to
fit<00:03:52.449> a<00:03:52.479> lot<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.859> for<00:03:54.250> example<00:03:54.729> this<00:03:55.000> dress

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
fit a lot more so for example this dress

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.210 
fit a lot more so for example this dress
is<00:03:55.510> probably<00:03:55.659> the<00:03:55.989> most<00:03:56.139> complicated<00:03:56.620> thing

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
is probably the most complicated thing

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.300 
is probably the most complicated thing
but<00:03:57.489> if<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.629> just<00:03:58.840> take<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.169> and<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.769> roll<00:04:00.040> it

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
but if you just take it and you roll it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.729 
but if you just take it and you roll it
like<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:00.940> you're<00:04:01.720> going<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.959> be<00:04:02.109> able<00:04:02.199> to<00:04:02.349> fit

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
like so you're going to be able to fit

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.399 
like so you're going to be able to fit
more<00:04:02.769> as<00:04:03.370> opposed<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.000> folding<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.260> you're

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
more as opposed to folding it so you're

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.099 
more as opposed to folding it so you're
just<00:04:05.530> going<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.769> roll<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.549> up<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.030> then<00:04:07.989> this

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
just going to roll it up and then this

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.960 
just going to roll it up and then this
is<00:04:08.319> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.650> avoid<00:04:08.889> wrinkles<00:04:09.579> and<00:04:09.760> when<00:04:09.849> you
