00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
killed but uh yeah running scavenger

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.949 
killed but uh yeah running scavenger
definitely<00:03:10.329> helps<00:03:10.689> um<00:03:11.189> as<00:03:12.189> your<00:03:12.430> first<00:03:12.579> but

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
definitely helps um as your first but

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.330 
definitely helps um as your first but
just<00:03:13.959> having<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.260> extra<00:03:14.530> hema<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.159> don't

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
just having that extra hema you don't

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.339 
just having that extra hema you don't
have<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.549> worry<00:03:15.819> about<00:03:15.970> picking<00:03:16.750> up<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.139> my

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349

have to worry about picking up that my
packs<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:17.980> when<00:03:18.340> you're<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:19.199> a<00:03:20.199> pretty<00:03:20.500> high

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
packs and when you're on a pretty high

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.729 
packs and when you're on a pretty high
street<00:03:21.129> but<00:03:21.489> um<00:03:21.989> yeah<00:03:22.989> as<00:03:23.169> you<00:03:23.319> can<00:03:23.349> see<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.650> just

um yeah even if I'm playing in a party I
like<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.299> stay<00:03:34.930> away<00:03:35.169> from<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.560> rest<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.859> my

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
like to stay away from the rest of my

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.309 
like to stay away from the rest of my
teammates<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.879> yeah<00:03:37.540> that's<00:03:37.720> what<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.079> see

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.460 
teammates and yeah that's what you see
me<00:03:38.500> do<00:03:38.709> I'm<00:03:39.549> not<00:03:39.879> sure<00:03:40.120> how<00:03:40.299> far<00:03:40.569> along<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:41.230> am<00:03:41.260> I

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
me do I'm not sure how far along I am I

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.550 
me do I'm not sure how far along I am I
think<00:03:41.889> I<00:03:42.010> might<00:03:42.190> be<00:03:42.370> pretty<00:03:42.549> close<00:03:42.879> but<00:03:43.299> um

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
think I might be pretty close but um

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.009 
think I might be pretty close but um
yeah<00:03:44.560> just<00:03:44.590> running<00:03:45.340> around<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.090> yeah

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
yeah just running around and yeah

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.809 
yeah just running around and yeah
throughout<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.010> rest<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.370> match<00:03:48.609> I

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
throughout the rest of this match I

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.930 
throughout the rest of this match I
think<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:49.299> move<00:03:49.900> around<00:03:50.229> a<00:03:50.500> lot<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.919> uh<00:03:50.979> yeah

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
think I move around a lot and uh yeah

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.599 
think I move around a lot and uh yeah
try<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.329> stay<00:03:52.599> in<00:03:52.659> one<00:03:52.840> place<00:03:52.989> because

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
try not to stay in one place because

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.520 
try not to stay in one place because
yeah<00:03:54.609> in<00:03:54.879> this<00:03:55.030> game<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.540> way<00:03:55.659> the<00:03:55.840> spawns<00:03:56.199> are

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
yeah in this game the way the spawns are

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.129 
yeah in this game the way the spawns are
and<00:03:56.889> yeah<00:03:57.729> the<00:03:57.879> way<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.150> revenge<00:03:58.540> system

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
and yeah the way the revenge system

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.949 
and yeah the way the revenge system
works<00:03:59.549> you<00:04:00.549> tend<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.909> get<00:04:01.060> spawned<00:04:01.449> on<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.690> lot

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
works you tend to get spawned on a lot

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.500 
works you tend to get spawned on a lot
so<00:04:02.349> it's<00:04:03.010> definitely<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.489> good<00:04:03.699> idea<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.329> our

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
so it's definitely a good idea to our

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.719 
so it's definitely a good idea to our
yeah<00:04:04.989> keep<00:04:05.650> moving<00:04:05.979> around<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.340> map<00:04:06.370> you

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
yeah keep moving around the map you

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.069 
yeah keep moving around the map you
don't<00:04:06.879> want<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> stay<00:04:07.209> in<00:04:07.239> one<00:04:07.540> place<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.870> too

and yeah this and as you can see the

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.260 
and yeah this and as you can see the
rain<00:04:34.590> or<00:04:34.979> like<00:04:35.400> you're<00:04:35.580> able<00:04:35.879> to<00:04:35.940> pick<00:04:36.000> people

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
rain or like you're able to pick people

off<00:04:36.539> from<00:04:36.780> long<00:04:37.110> range<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.770> yeah<00:04:38.669> usually

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
off from long range and yeah usually

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.510 
off from long range and yeah usually
with<00:04:39.300> an<00:04:39.419> SMG<00:04:39.750> or<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.289> with<00:04:40.470> any<00:04:40.680> other<00:04:40.800> SMG

with an SMG or like with any other SMG

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.850 
with an SMG or like with any other SMG
you<00:04:41.699> can't<00:04:42.000> really<00:04:42.419> do<00:04:42.599> that<00:04:42.629> because<00:04:43.319> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
you can't really do that because the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.589 
you can't really do that because the
recall<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.460> too<00:04:44.610> much<00:04:44.819> or<00:04:45.090> like<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> range

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
recall is too much or like the range

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.140 
recall is too much or like the range
drop<00:04:45.900> off<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.319> much<00:04:46.500> but<00:04:46.889> yeah<00:04:47.639> with<00:04:47.789> the<00:04:47.879> mp7

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
drop off so much but yeah with the mp7

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.390 
drop off so much but yeah with the mp7
this<00:04:48.599> is<00:04:48.720> why<00:04:48.960> has<00:04:49.199> put<00:04:49.470> become<00:04:49.770> my<00:04:49.889> favorite
