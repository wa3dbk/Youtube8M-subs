bared the same what you're going to do
is<00:02:46.660> you're<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.290> cut<00:02:47.500> away<00:02:48.489> with<00:02:49.450> the

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
is you're going to cut away with the

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.490 
is you're going to cut away with the
middle<00:02:49.930> bit<00:02:50.760> from<00:02:51.760> one<00:02:51.910> end<00:02:52.090> they're<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.599> same

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
middle bit from one end they're the same

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.530 
middle bit from one end they're the same
as<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.739> one<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.099> take<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.579> out<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.970> then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
as the one you just take it out and then

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.849 
as the one you just take it out and then
you<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.750> do<00:02:55.900> exactly<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.349> same<00:02:56.379> to<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> other

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
you can do exactly the same to the other

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.509 
you can do exactly the same to the other
end<00:02:57.099> cut<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.209> there<00:02:58.500> do<00:02:59.500> not<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:02.260> them

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
end cut it there do not have them

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.089 
end cut it there do not have them
misaligned<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.819> then<00:03:03.940> cut<00:03:04.209> off<00:03:04.569> one<00:03:04.840> end

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
misaligned and then cut off one end

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.800 
misaligned and then cut off one end
because<00:03:06.099> if<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> do<00:03:06.549> then<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.239> sends<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.660> bit

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
because if you do then that sends a bit

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.660 
because if you do then that sends a bit
will<00:03:07.959> not<00:03:08.049> be<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.290> middle<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.489> have<00:03:09.579> to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
will not be in the middle so you have to

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.449 
will not be in the middle so you have to
cut<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:09.879> from<00:03:10.060> each<00:03:10.239> end<00:03:10.470> been<00:03:11.470> there<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
cut it from each end been there and a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.860 
cut it from each end been there and a
bit<00:03:12.609> there<00:03:14.819> once<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:15.940> cut<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.269> ends<00:03:16.480> off<00:03:16.569> just

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
bit there once you cut the ends off just

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.360 
bit there once you cut the ends off just
cut<00:03:17.049> little<00:03:17.260> grooves<00:03:17.470> out<00:03:17.650> exactly<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.160> same

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
cut little grooves out exactly the same

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.750 
cut little grooves out exactly the same
as<00:03:18.790> your<00:03:19.030> wire<00:03:19.269> you've<00:03:19.480> taken<00:03:19.660> out<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.519> shim

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
as your wire you've taken out the shim

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.740 
as your wire you've taken out the shim
we've<00:03:21.970> done<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.599> new

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
we've done that and this is the new

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.900 
we've done that and this is the new
white<00:03:25.959> but<00:03:26.139> now<00:03:26.260> we've<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.680> kept<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.730> middle

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
white but now we've just kept the middle

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.339 
white but now we've just kept the middle
bit<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.209> middle<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.720> we've<00:03:28.870> cut<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.169> two

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
bit in the middle and we've cut the two

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.530 
bit in the middle and we've cut the two
n<00:03:29.470> bits<00:03:29.680> away<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.700> we've<00:03:30.880> cut<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.299> same

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
n bits away and we've cut it to the same

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020 
n bits away and we've cut it to the same
size<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.989> your<00:03:32.049> other<00:03:32.139> wiper<00:03:32.790> we're<00:03:33.790> now<00:03:33.880> going

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
size as your other wiper we're now going

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.810 
size as your other wiper we're now going
to<00:03:34.090> fit<00:03:34.269> it<00:03:34.419> to<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> frame
