00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello we are here again here in my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.680
 kraft in a new way that is called 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.510
 royston past or paste it rest since 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.840
 comes this mod 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.840
 just look at this circuit of the rest 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.830
 although we have here and they will be able to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.869
 observe is the rest in common and this 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 is how they see the rest of the mod 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 which is the remaining one can be pasted in 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:40.350
 vertical shape can be carried by the sun 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 horizontally go down without 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 need to do the typical thing that would be 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.030
 this this 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.760
 and this among other ways of uploading it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 reston or download it not necessary to perform 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020
 this 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.809
 or other things simply with this mode 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.970
 it can not be very cool mechanisms 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.730
 as you see here it goes up and simply 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 it opens as they see every time the arrest 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.790
 still loses earth energy is going to say 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.480
 good it changes color 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.980
 the color means that by staying in the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.320
 strongest shaft 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.020
 here is weakening a bit and also 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.280
 brings us these two are the things this 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.000
 he wants to peter investigate with puppy 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 terminator that exam can be put 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.500
 I remove this and this 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 not because the reverse is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.790
 they also follow the tics one can be 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.400
 this guy 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.250
 and as you see if they work we also have 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.110
 the comparator if you can also put 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 on the floor 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 can not put the comparator here I will 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.630
 put it for example 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.490
 aido 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.799
 it's a little complicated to manage but 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.799
 good 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.019
 the character is simple 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.380
 the fret 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:31.069
 of the arrest pas is this a ball of slim 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.080
 and the rest to see this I want Peter is 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.920
 a ball of es line and the repeater and the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.170
 of the same comparator 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.860
 because to palencia the ball of slim has 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.190
 a function that is super globe so 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.680
 say it can be pasted clarified 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.000
 also that the rest of the way is 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.280
 you can put in these four tips and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.860
 it only occupies one block while 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:03.380
 the arrest in common directly occupies 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.569
 four blocks or in radius 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.470
 while this one occupies 1 as we can 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:14.950
 see here the subtraction of the mod and the common one 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.950
 can stick and serve completely 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.470
 as you can see 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.470
 it's great 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.519
 come serve 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.799
 continues to serve and this is what the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.500
 mode is very good for making mechanisms 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.500
 can also be put on the roof look 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.990
 but let's put a re peter is 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.490
 complicated to handle for these little things 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.230
 the middle one that means that you see 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.060
 hollow or middle square is for 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.140
 to break 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.930
 so I'm going to do like that and that's just 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.880
 you give him the means and they break the two 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.880
 good and is here 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.280
 Here we can see how it would look 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.850
 a 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.490
 le vert 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.790
 and it works by in which that asset this 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.590
 to see 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.139
 that obviously works on missing 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.859
 pass it here and now if it works at 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.340
 it looks like this and it connects 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.690
 as we see it works 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.690
 and you can paste it on the roof shape 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.289
 horizontal any shape does not matter 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.550
 Also here 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:41.630
 so now I've seen it here 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.270
 so that with better clear clarity the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.360
 can they put 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.360
 so so so 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.400
 how complicated can you put it all 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.400
 the ways that you want 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.689
 quite useful this way apart from 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.650
 funny and original 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.050
 there is something for the easel 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.310
 and it would be like this these are the ways that 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.630
 you can put the subtractions and that's it 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.919
 what we bring and good we see each other 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.919
 videos about many others
