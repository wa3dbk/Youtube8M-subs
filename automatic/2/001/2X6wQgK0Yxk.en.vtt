with it the top part just twists off and
it<00:00:52.199> actually<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> looks<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.129> drink

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
shaker there at the top and you can just

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.340 
shaker there at the top and you can just
twist<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.480> open<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> holes

that as well

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.229

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.540 
area
it<00:02:13.000> kind<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.510> even<00:02:13.900> thinks<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.470> thought<00:02:15.099> all

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
it kind of even thinks out I thought all

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.729 
it kind of even thinks out I thought all
over<00:02:16.360> my<00:02:16.540> face<00:02:16.810> where<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.080> put<00:02:17.349> it<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.470> kind<00:02:17.709> of

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
over my face where I put it I kind of

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.619 
over my face where I put it I kind of
went<00:02:17.860> under<00:02:18.099> my<00:02:18.250> eyes<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> little<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:18.879> too<00:02:19.239> but

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
went under my eyes a little bit too but

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.410 
went under my eyes a little bit too but
the<00:02:19.840> thing<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:21.129> there's<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.819> lot<00:02:22.180> of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the thing is is that there's a lot of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.869 
the thing is is that there's a lot of
really<00:02:22.750> inexpensive<00:02:23.680> powders<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.220> do<00:02:24.700> what

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
really inexpensive powders that do what

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.479 
really inexpensive powders that do what
this<00:02:25.060> does<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:26.170> pressed<00:02:26.500> format<00:02:27.099> with<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
this does in a pressed format with a

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.130 
this does in a pressed format with a
mirror<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.450> little<00:02:28.660> puff<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
mirror with the little puff and the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.199 
mirror with the little puff and the
compact<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.160> if<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> way<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
compact so like if that is the way you

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.100 
compact so like if that is the way you
want<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.630> touch<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.440> powder<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:33.840> mean<00:02:34.840> I

want to touch up is with powder I mean I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.600 
want to touch up is with powder I mean I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
think that there are a lot of other

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.820 
think that there are a lot of other
methods<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.300> there<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.690> are<00:02:37.780> workable<00:02:38.230> that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
methods out there that are workable that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.339 
methods out there that are workable that
are<00:02:38.920> definitely<00:02:39.640> good<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.420> get<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> job<00:02:41.170> done

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
are definitely good and get the job done

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.020 
are definitely good and get the job done

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
just like this does I'm thinking of like

go to touch up with it is convenient I
mean<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.459> definitely<00:02:54.640> stepped<00:02:55.269> up

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
mean it's definitely stepped up

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.059

convenience<00:02:56.019> compared<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> lot<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.739> loose

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
convenience compared to a lot of loose

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.640 
convenience compared to a lot of loose
powders<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:58.269> for<00:02:58.780> me<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.019> don't<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.560> it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
powders but for me I don't think it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.520 
powders but for me I don't think it
really<00:02:59.799> tops<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.760> pressed<00:03:01.239> powders<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.780> are

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
really tops the pressed powders that are

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.949 
really tops the pressed powders that are
just<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.829> compact<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.670> mirror<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.840> know

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
just a compact in a mirror and you know

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.420 
just a compact in a mirror and you know
you<00:03:05.019> don't<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.380> separate<00:03:05.769> parts<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.250> deal

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
you don't have separate parts to deal

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.759 
you don't have separate parts to deal
with<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.540> think<00:03:07.780> there's<00:03:07.959> an<00:03:08.079> advantage<00:03:08.410> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
with and I think there's an advantage to

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.410 
with and I think there's an advantage to
that<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.280> might<00:03:09.459> say<00:03:09.700> well<00:03:09.940> what<00:03:10.209> if<00:03:10.299> you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
that and you might say well what if you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.270 
that and you might say well what if you
just<00:03:10.660> put<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.319> as<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> finishing<00:03:11.950> powder

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
just put this on as a finishing powder

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.069 
just put this on as a finishing powder
does<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> do<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> good<00:03:13.450> job<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.900> like

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
does it do a good job of like

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.930 
does it do a good job of like
controlling<00:03:14.709> your<00:03:14.829> oil<00:03:15.040> longer<00:03:15.579> through<00:03:15.819> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
effect in that way I kind of see it as a

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.640 
effect in that way I kind of see it as a
short-term<00:03:24.790> solution<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:26.109> part<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.560> your

at the end of my makeup loads also this

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.170 
at the end of my makeup loads also this
claims<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.709> be<00:03:44.829> an<00:03:44.920> invisible<00:03:45.220> finish<00:03:45.850> but

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
claims to be an invisible finish but

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.550 
claims to be an invisible finish but
I've<00:03:46.359> always<00:03:46.540> been<00:03:46.750> of<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.900> mindset<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.380> if

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
I've always been of the mindset that if

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.129 
I've always been of the mindset that if
you<00:03:47.680> use<00:03:48.010> enough<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:49.060> something<00:03:49.480> like<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.900> it

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
you use enough of something like this it

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.900 
you use enough of something like this it
will<00:03:50.410> show<00:03:50.680> up<00:03:50.889> on<00:03:51.040> your<00:03:51.100> skin<00:03:51.549> see<00:03:51.730> it's<00:03:51.850> a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
will show up on your skin see it's a

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.210 
will show up on your skin see it's a
little<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.209> beige<00:03:52.630> but<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.049> feel<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:54.040> has

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
little bit beige but I feel like it has

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.640 
little bit beige but I feel like it has
kind<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.700> yellow<00:03:55.030> tone<00:03:55.060> as<00:03:55.630> well<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.410> I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
kind of a yellow tone as well so I

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.460 
kind of a yellow tone as well so I
wonder<00:03:57.370> how<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:57.970> would<00:03:58.239> really<00:03:58.599> come<00:03:58.959> off<00:03:59.200> on

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
wonder how this would really come off on

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.430 
wonder how this would really come off on
a<00:03:59.500> super<00:04:00.190> dark<00:04:00.609> skin<00:04:01.120> tone<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.660> bottom<00:04:02.170> line

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
a super dark skin tone so bottom line

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.099 
a super dark skin tone so bottom line
very<00:04:03.130> cool<00:04:03.430> packaging<00:04:04.060> concept<00:04:04.269> for<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> loose

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
very cool packaging concept for a loose

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.620 
very cool packaging concept for a loose
powder<00:04:05.470> it<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.340> really<00:04:06.940> lightweight<00:04:07.239> on<00:04:07.599> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
powder it is really lightweight on the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.180 
powder it is really lightweight on the
skin<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:08.049> mean<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:08.410> don't<00:04:08.470> feel<00:04:08.769> like<00:04:09.040> I'm

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
skin I mean I don't feel like I'm

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.180 
skin I mean I don't feel like I'm
putting<00:04:09.400> anything<00:04:09.760> heavy<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.480> when<00:04:10.989> I<00:04:11.190> touch

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
putting anything heavy on when I touch

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.280 
putting anything heavy on when I touch
up<00:04:12.430> with<00:04:12.639> this<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.239> don't<00:04:13.450> dislike<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
up with this so I don't dislike the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.990 
up with this so I don't dislike the
product<00:04:14.739> I<00:04:14.829> think<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:15.130> can<00:04:15.280> definitely<00:04:15.790> turn

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
product I think it can definitely turn

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.659 
product I think it can definitely turn
oily<00:04:16.539> skin<00:04:16.870> into<00:04:17.440> matte<00:04:17.650> skin<00:04:18.010> as<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.310> saw<00:04:18.519> in
