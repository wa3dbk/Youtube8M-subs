a<00:02:38.379> flaw<00:02:39.379> this<00:02:39.829> was<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.129> cruise<00:02:40.700> ship<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:42.049> is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
a flaw this was a cruise ship but is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.630 
a flaw this was a cruise ship but is
just<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.860> water<00:02:43.159> bone<00:02:44.650> okay<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> looks

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
just to water bone okay but it looks

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.619 
just to water bone okay but it looks
like<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:47.150> air<00:02:47.299> as<00:02:47.989> long<00:02:48.049> as<00:02:48.439> he<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:48.829> note<00:02:49.629> but

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
like the air as long as he can note but

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.679 
like the air as long as he can note but
the<00:02:50.659> cruise<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.470> what<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> hope<00:02:52.099> for<00:02:52.430> not<00:02:53.390> this

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
the cruise is what I hope for not this

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.520 
the cruise is what I hope for not this
