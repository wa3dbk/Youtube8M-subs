00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.300 

so<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.450> finished<00:01:41.810> clearing<00:01:42.020> away<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.320> soil

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so we finished clearing away the soil

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.210 
so we finished clearing away the soil
and<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.940> surface<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.440> can<00:01:45.770> see<00:01:46.010> a

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and the surface and now you can see a

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.730 
and the surface and now you can see a
wide<00:01:46.580> buitres<00:01:47.060> exposed<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:48.410> certainly

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
wide buitres exposed this certainly

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.320 
wide buitres exposed this certainly
gives<00:01:49.010> more<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.370> impression<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:49.940> an<00:01:50.030> older

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
gives more the impression of an older

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.940 
gives more the impression of an older
tree<00:01:50.540> something<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.200> stood<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.590> test<00:01:51.620> of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
tree something that stood the test of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190 
tree something that stood the test of
time<00:01:52.180> where<00:01:53.180> we're<00:01:53.390> trying<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.690> open<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
time where we're trying to open the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.990 
time where we're trying to open the
trunk<00:01:54.440> up<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.160> you've<00:01:55.340> got<00:01:55.520> two<00:01:55.730> or<00:01:55.820> three

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
trunk up if you've got two or three

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.180 
trunk up if you've got two or three
branches<00:01:56.450> growing<00:01:56.690> together<00:01:56.930> again<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:57.980> can

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
branches growing together again we can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.830 
branches growing together again we can
select<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.790> best<00:01:59.000> branch<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.480> great<00:01:59.720> if

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
select the best branch it's great if

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.410 
select the best branch it's great if
we've<00:01:59.990> got<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.290> choice<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.490> without<00:02:02.270> further

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
we've got the choice so without further

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.660 
we've got the choice so without further
ado<00:02:03.050> let's<00:02:03.380> have<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> look<00:02:03.770> at<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:03.980> tree<00:02:04.280> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
ado let's have a look at this tree and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.000 
ado let's have a look at this tree and
see<00:02:05.090> if<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.330> can<00:02:05.480> start<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.560> some<00:02:06.740> shared

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
see if we can start to get some shared

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:16.950 
see if we can start to get some shared
into

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.060 

eat<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.170> wire<00:02:18.830> flowing<00:02:19.370> down<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.790> bench

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
eat the wire flowing down the bench

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.300 
eat the wire flowing down the bench
triangle<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.820> between<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:24.380> sideshow<00:02:24.950> so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
triangle in between the sideshow so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.920 
triangle in between the sideshow so
you're<00:02:25.490> not<00:02:25.640> damaging<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.930> green<00:02:27.140> foliage<00:02:28.930> we

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
you're not damaging the green foliage we

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.230 
you're not damaging the green foliage we
finish<00:02:30.260> tiling<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.740> raw<00:02:31.490> material<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
finish tiling the raw material the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.840 
finish tiling the raw material the
garden<00:02:32.600> plant<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.200> now<00:02:33.740> we<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.400> stand<00:02:34.640> back

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
garden plant and now we can stand back

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.480 
garden plant and now we can stand back
and<00:02:35.120> look<00:02:35.660> at<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:35.930> tree<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.890> enjoys<00:02:37.220> its
