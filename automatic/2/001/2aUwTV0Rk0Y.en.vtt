and<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.090> 4550<00:00:04.020> minutes<00:00:04.140> into<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:04.980> then

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
and we're 4550 minutes into it and then

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.460 
and we're 4550 minutes into it and then
we<00:00:05.670> finally<00:00:06.089> get<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.450> point<00:00:06.750> where<00:00:07.319> we

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
we finally get to the point where we

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.560 
we finally get to the point where we
where<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.740> filing<00:00:08.340> down<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.330> raw

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
where we filing down this this this raw

where we filing down this this this raw
material<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.290> square<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.950> made<00:00:11.219> smaller<00:00:12.230> by

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
material the square is made smaller by

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.500 
material the square is made smaller by
going<00:00:14.549> into<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> machine<00:00:16.190> where<00:00:17.300> there<00:00:18.300> are

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
going into a machine where there are

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
going into a machine where there are
there<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.840> six<00:00:19.199> planing<00:00:19.830> heads<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.580> first

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
there are six planing heads the first

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.689 
there are six planing heads the first
two<00:00:21.029> planing<00:00:21.449> heads<00:00:21.660> cut<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.710> reference<00:00:23.220> faces

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
two planing heads cut to reference faces

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.750 
two planing heads cut to reference faces
on<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> stick<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.470> four<00:00:25.800> faces<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.519> cut

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
on the stick then all four faces are cut

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
on the stick then all four faces are cut
to<00:00:27.300> create<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.660> uniform<00:00:28.019> size<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.189> goes

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
to create a uniform size so it goes

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.330 
to create a uniform size so it goes
through<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.550> few<00:00:29.609> stages<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.710> becoming<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
through a few stages of becoming a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
through a few stages of becoming a
little<00:00:32.669> smaller<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:33.960> more<00:00:34.200> refined

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
little smaller and a little more refined

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.060 
little smaller and a little more refined
where<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.040> qualities<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
where they see some of the qualities of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.850 
where they see some of the qualities of
the<00:00:38.370> wood<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> then<00:00:39.780> eliminate<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the wood and then eliminate some of the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.410 
the wood and then eliminate some of the
problem<00:00:41.340> wood<00:00:44.870> when<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> square<00:00:46.289> block

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
problem wood when the square block

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.880 
problem wood when the square block
transforms<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> rounds

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890

Celinda<00:00:50.820> curves<00:00:51.360> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> stake<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.579> thought

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Celinda curves kind of stake I thought

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.360 
Celinda curves kind of stake I thought
was<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:54.000> interesting<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.320> first<00:00:55.829> process

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
was very interesting the first process

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.290 
was very interesting the first process
in<00:00:56.550> making<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> square<00:00:58.859> round<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.120> they

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in making the the square round as they

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100 
in making the the square round as they
put<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.320> square<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
put the the square into this it's like a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.429 
put the the square into this it's like a
round<00:01:04.739> plane<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:05.820> something<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.930> cuts<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
round plane or something that cuts it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
round plane or something that cuts it
perfectly<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.460> around<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.240> square

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
perfectly all the way around the square

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
perfectly all the way around the square
is<00:01:09.659> fed<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.500> center<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> cutting

is fed through the center of a cutting
head<00:01:11.549> reducing<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> square<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> dowel

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
head reducing the square to a dowel

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.480 
head reducing the square to a dowel
after<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> square<00:01:14.700> becomes<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.210> dowel<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:17.310> goes

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
after the square becomes a dowel it goes

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.219 
after the square becomes a dowel it goes
through<00:01:17.820> another<00:01:17.939> inspection<00:01:18.689> process<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
through another inspection process and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
through another inspection process and
it<00:01:19.650> goes<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.520> goes<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> physical

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it goes out it goes through a physical

it goes out it goes through a physical
inspection<00:01:21.960> process<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:24.119> put

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
inspection process and also they put

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
inspection process and also they put
everything<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> conveyor<00:01:25.290> belt<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.979> it's

everything on a conveyor belt and it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.469 
everything on a conveyor belt and it's
looked<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.030> according<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> weight<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> and
