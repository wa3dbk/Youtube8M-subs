moving<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:20.980> don't<00:03:21.160> know<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.489> Seth<00:03:22.209> can<00:03:24.330> jump

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
moving I don't know and Seth can jump

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.430 
moving I don't know and Seth can jump
higher<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:27.310> jumping<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.120> involved<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.900> don't

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
higher if jumping is involved I don't

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.050 
higher if jumping is involved I don't
think<00:03:29.709> there<00:03:29.980> will<00:03:30.100> be<00:03:30.160> jumping<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:30.850> this

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
think there will be jumping in this

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.720 
think there will be jumping in this
maybe<00:03:31.840> etho<00:03:32.410> can<00:03:32.620> disappear<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.250> vanish<00:03:33.610> like

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
maybe etho can disappear and vanish like

npcs<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.330> we<00:04:04.480> haven't<00:04:04.600> done<00:04:04.930> anything<00:04:04.989> with

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
npcs but we haven't done anything with

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.640 
npcs but we haven't done anything with
them<00:04:05.500> yet<00:04:05.890> but<00:04:06.550> uh<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.989> cheat<00:04:08.260> me<00:04:08.440> or

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
them yet but uh is that this cheat me or

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.190 
them yet but uh is that this cheat me or
does<00:04:08.739> that<00:04:08.890> feel<00:04:09.190> bigger<00:04:09.430> okay<00:04:10.090> anyways<00:04:10.930> um

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
does that feel bigger okay anyways um

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.050 
does that feel bigger okay anyways um
you<00:04:12.010> get<00:04:12.160> too<00:04:12.250> warm<00:04:12.430> around<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.910> have

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
you get too warm around you have

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.600 
you get too warm around you have
omnidirectional<00:04:13.660> character<00:04:14.380> movement

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
omnidirectional character movement

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.240 
omnidirectional character movement
basically<00:04:15.610> mr.<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.419> this<00:04:16.570> case<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:18.130> not

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
basically mr. in this case it's not

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.680 
basically mr. in this case it's not
really<00:04:18.549> omnidirectional<00:04:18.940> because<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.510> can't

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
really omnidirectional because you can't

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.780 
really omnidirectional because you can't
go<00:04:19.870> like<00:04:20.430> precisely<00:04:21.430> 30<00:04:21.970> degrees<00:04:22.510> to<00:04:22.840> the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
go like precisely 30 degrees to the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.240 
go like precisely 30 degrees to the
West<00:04:24.150> for<00:04:24.450> some<00:04:24.630> or<00:04:24.990> 30<00:04:25.470> degrees<00:04:25.770> in<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:25.980> East

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
West for some or 30 degrees in the East

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.540 
West for some or 30 degrees in the East
or<00:04:26.550> yeah<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:28.980> what<00:04:29.040> I<00:04:29.160> mean<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.460> get

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
or yeah but you get what I mean you get

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.630 
or yeah but you get what I mean you get
to<00:04:29.610> do<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:31.650> their<00:04:31.890> exes<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:33.230> time<00:04:34.640> Hawk

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
to do it get their exes so time Hawk

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.720 
to do it get their exes so time Hawk
