00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 rockstar has removed some gta5 from 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 old generation and then put it back 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.550
 all in the name of the fun of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.360
 players then banks are normal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 beauty 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 unless the game is a black flag 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 There life did not go there. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:54.270
 the limits of acceptable bugs 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:56.969
 so let's go party bands 21 games of the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.239
 new generation and physical and digital media 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.219
 new era games and starting with 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.159
 newly released resident evil revelations 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.710
 two in a weird blog where one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.140
 simple box looks like it was owned 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 for something or she is possessed or 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.990
 It's Guina and Jailson who are in there. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.990
 doing something 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:38.030
 and the box was not just struggling is not 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.160
 the attacked claire here the sims 3 a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 child was born say that with a dog in the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.729
 Dark've heard of that so there is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.550
 this happened here 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.650
 just look at the mic that child looks like 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.110
 she was born with a kind of protection 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.630
 skin that protects something from me that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.630
 it's even old scary that madness 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:11.630
 Peraí let me see what it really was 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:20.900
 I remembered her very well, yes, and yes 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:23.209
 and we all know that michael 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.459
 love a dick but in this case here I 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.290
 I think he took pica with gunpowder looks 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.290
 just what he's gonna get old 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.210
 it is certain that it was not even crowded 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.900
 so close that you even close your eyes and 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:44.570
 send for the old ear and still 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.610
 resident evil revelations 21 bang that 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.520
 leaves the enemy walking against the wall 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.440
 infinitely this blog is happening 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.900
 very often and some players 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.000
 are criticizing this type of 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.770
 thing because a battle that would take 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.510
 minutes to complete 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.690
 you end up doing it in very few 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.580
 minutes all because the unfortunate did not 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.580
 presents you with no difficulty 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.840
 I'm going to take advantage of this moment to 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.670
 say something that I will not talk about 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.070

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.709
