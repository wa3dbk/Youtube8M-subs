00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.819
 9 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.939
 got netapp to let you know on Monday 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.269
 just guessing for the reason is that back in the competition for everything 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.279
 keep the club 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.099
 it is very displeased the big fire in two sheds and that there will be in the coming years 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.099
 will be prevented 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 warner bros 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.380
 both to read 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.330
 so what 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.770
 something of brands as in the Netherlands 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.160
 Tolbert may be following the Dutch culture 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.570
 released after questioning who is being investigated 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.710
 I know 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 the device 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
 I think that just like that 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.120
 there are decency rules
