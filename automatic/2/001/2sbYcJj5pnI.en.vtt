00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:12.010
 Hi Kim is the way you think you have seen with this time 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:17.830
 The front of the junior teachers if a lot of people when I have been a teacher 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.240
 How do you cope when you give your senior a coffee errand? 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.110
 Will 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:27.730
 The moment you get this question , you can say it's a blur. 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.449
 The word "hypothermia" is also easily understood by someone who thinks of bandages 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.250
 I would 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:37.300
 The general public will say what they mean. 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.530
 A person speaks to a person on the top 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.760
 To do so, a Joie boss in the squad 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.809
 We talk about wickedness and even violence. 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 I'll try. 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.350
 It is important to always remember seeing you in various situations for example, the first 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.800
 The second 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 Let's say for fun approached again 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 What does this mean? 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.480
 Uh, you should be clear about the situation, but your older brother 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 Would you like to get seniors to get a cup of coffee rejoices week 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.180
 If you have come to talk funny approach Sanya emitter flirting give it accepted as charming 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 Is to be 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.980
 I need you to pick me coffee when you're senior. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.120
 I hope if you mix in a charming position that this course is to give more 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 I will. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.850
 But I also have a mood that I shed for others 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 You have to look and see. 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.390
 This junior could of course have done it to pay attention to me 3 times 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.700
 By the way, 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.400
 How can you tell me that you are a junior? 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.490
 2 Look at the mood 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:06.800
 If this were a straight face that'm gonna I have ever approached the younger considerably 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:11.720
 You will be faced with a difficult situation. So the problem is utterly Atmosphere 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:17.270
 It could be a special situation that needs to be seen and understood. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:22.100
 So, if you were a joke in the jorun , 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:27.080
 Being well received and not responding uncomfortably to Junior 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:29.959
 It is very wise to have a humorous approach 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.880
 Now, what will be the second situation? 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:42.260
 I saw this once and for all. 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:46.490
 It's a look that really matter becomes a junior who had a habit of buying briefs 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.970
 So , beyond this habit, 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.380
 He's the one who has done more than the lesser-of-a-kind pair. 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.910
 What do you do when you really do this is somehow the atmosphere 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.420
 The problem seems to be focused on the second rather than the first 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.489
 Apparently a naughty junior teacher 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:12.200
 To the seniors in terms of 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.860
 It will make the instructions on how to act down the instructions to seniors 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.730
 So you have to look at the countermeasures. 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.730
 On the spot 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:28.819
 This is what you do . 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:33.590
 Here is how there are seniors living in two bookcases to keep this hierarchy 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:38.569
 If you are so naughty then everything will be broken 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.180
 I'm sorry when I gave you a map on the spot. 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:47.180
 Will you reflect on that you can not think of it until now and write so 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:54.769
 If you act like that 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:04:00.739
 If larger reflection rather than giving the same myeonbak to seniors because you're an idiot 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:06.920
 Because you did not show any leadership that will do the juniors 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:11.060
 It is not what you have created, 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.459
 The situation is that it can come in. 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:21.410
 Serious situation is happening. 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:22.850
 In fact, in the classroom where students do not see the scene, 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.900
 It is said that it can 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:31.580
 So maybe you witness these things 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:37.640
 I have a feeling that you've been part of the experience. 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:43.220
 You can imagine what students do not see 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:49.310
 I suppose you could imagine that an immoral act might appear. 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:53.300
 When I do this, it is not desirable to teach on the spot anyway 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:58.820
 So the countermeasures for this are monks . 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.900
 Oh, yeah eocha 4 That's the shape you want to eat the coffee and I give the example keunki 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.810
 Next 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:11.000
 There quietly lovable personally Ah earlier the problem is that I have some very embarrassing 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:16.460
 I wish I could do this part of it, and if I respond calmly, 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.450
 That junior who approached is obviously sensitive . 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:26.780
 Well, the approach should be very calm. 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:30.040
 So maybe I do not see these things students to virtually assume 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.350
 Where teachers in society 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:40.960
 There are so many professional strikes that you have to be able to cope with this wisely. 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:44.110
 What is the ability to assume that when debt becomes a teacher to you 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:49.780
 I think it will be a question, so this part 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:53.110
 How you can see the board with your composure and caring and generosity 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.910
 I think I have tested what it is. 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.910
 I'll see you next time.
