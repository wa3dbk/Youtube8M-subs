00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.369
 a video on the channel and to the next 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.780
 couple testteam of the year becker not 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.129
 in fifa 15 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.289
 we are back at the start of the team 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.760
 as he still feels like before 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.040
 few minutes and twice with di maria 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.390
 iniesta and big last episode there was 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.760
 Now traveling properly plays pulled 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.290
 have well and look definitely times 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.610
 in the last episode you have to do that 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.130
 fifth since the fifth team ok 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.570
 was awarded in any case very much 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.850
 I can tell you horny 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.829
 and also very valuable so look there 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.120
 pure and like this video loads 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.819
 like in any case since we will today 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.530
 another 99 98 15 km race in the year 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.879
 in the best player had in it and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.620
 Discos connection and has the are still 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.210
 among others in the team of the week 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.039
 oskar together or ruffier so there is 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.300
 neiße definitely players and 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.739
 Of course we want to pull one of them 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.879
 if he wants pixi himself and also the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.440
 mean to lack shop in against 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.269
 jumpy videos look and cheap 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.549
 ps and support me 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.679
 as well as looks at this 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.040
 Market leader is the link in the video 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.600
 description if you need headsets 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.520
 We wanted to open the first pack 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.560
 We hope that Beckmann of the fair 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.330
 the front cover on it and see if 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.980
 We would be lucky again 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.000
 vargas why not the kids are not 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.470
 long wing player from the fiorentina 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.060
 but no, of course not 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.210
 I think that's not going to be in shape 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.600
 more this week is well but from me 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.190
 I can do the rest and go directly 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.170
 on to the next pack I think so 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.610
 I forget but we'll see how 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.660
 the whole thing is going live again 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.220
 I really want that cover for me 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.080
 believe after the betrayal just take 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.480
 prefer the other way and that janina saw 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.890
 that sounds quite acceptable 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.680
 Let's see what's going to bring 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.380
 I'm curious 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.730
 come on already rené eagle one 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 the overrated player this year 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.000
 marko marin 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.530
 Well, no matter which one of the unsuccessful 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.840
 and I will be especially his performance 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.870
 absolutely to ko I can not speak it 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.030
 is late to schandau is definitely 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.470
 better but well at least player with 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.060
 the rating of over 80 that's alright 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.130
 Somewhat clear the rest will be like 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.530
 It can always be save cards 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.540
 because I need you and I will be an eagle 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 Nothing worth the show and us 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.500
 come to the next pack with again 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 that's why it works quite well 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.260
 we'll do it again and I'll do it this time 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.390
 again 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.950
 udo beckmann works great 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.510
 maybe this time again who 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.549
 who knows I do not look in the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.209
 curves as long as I have not already 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.720
 and it will be a karim bellarabi time 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.459
 not so good 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.170
 I have to go backwards because 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.629
 It could always be that I am in Berlin 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 have flies or in others 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.940
 High quality player is definitely 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.099
 possible 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.540
 It is definitely but it is 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.190
 relatively unlikely anyway 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.920
 We're going to try and study 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.989
 study as we all know nonetheless 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.780
 in it shirokov unfortunately not clever head 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.250
 nature or macro or we come out 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.190
 becomes 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.970
 and this time on the cover we'll do well 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 now one 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.849
 we're going to do that now 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.870
 just going through maybe brings 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:00.519
 very lucky no but yes yes she does 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.230
 ligaspieler no nothing unfortunately 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.670
 God because david silva goes for five 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 days now so a little stupid though 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.030
 again a good player, so me 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.349
 can not complain that I absolutely 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.459
 packaging is really not so far 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.629
 Above all, he was bad 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.639
 was to defend midfielders 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.930
 shit to the midfielder was very 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.329
 very good and maybe it will be 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.760
 better to be the strikers then we will 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.480
 see that often and tula but in there 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.129
 they are all worth leaving over 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.989
 we do that to the disco and come to 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.549
 next day with the car on the covers 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.720
 and again we leave that 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.620
 animation might undergo may 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.900
 associated with happiness 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.250
 benedikt höwedes not really 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.480
 but always German players 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.049
 maybe the sign for toni kroos 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:44.069
 Please toni does again to clever 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:45.609
 give it to me baby give me no matter man 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.079
 reliant 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.329
 lospech maybe with convent bottrop 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.709
 from the very beginning 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.720
 come now if the good player 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.889
 pull over 85 in the next sex then 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.870
 I do that in any case 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.090
 valbuena is definitely 80 already 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.370
 abdoulay konko to all this or everything 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.409
 worth nothing because update is one of the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.000
 absolute james this year brathwaite 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.159
 of course, casimiro also not 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.060
 bad but not so blatant 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.420
 In any case, it's better 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.510
 but we still have to say yes 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.950
 we say 315 car packs as if 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.419
 still the chance and maybe partly 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.880
 spontaneously because I like it because of me 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.050
 want to continue that I want another 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.720
 a few tricks opens up about it too 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.360
 have views to the video I know 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.070
 a consideration but it would be like 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.210
 hornet supplies the next one 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.750
 actually , a player goes through it completely 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.150
 well clear 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.320
 not really worth anything but 280 rating 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.840
 So we increase ourselves 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.240
 next to it was a 1 80 82 and stay 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.380
 therefore I'll hang on 84 but well what 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.669
 will make head injury take 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.740
 so even if it without these values 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.270
 is at all and comes to the penultimate 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.370
 at least in theory 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.600
 with figures on the carport 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.919
 the fifth cup are really good 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.150
 I must honestly say I do 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.290
 still the most fun to draw because we 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.610
 we have a lot of players in it 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.210
 back down rating against him 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.700
 to bed 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.960
 hanno balitsch a former 96er returns 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.560
 unfortunately still plays how old is he 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.940
 now 1 833 in 1 34 years old 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.669
 driver of the second first birthday 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.139
 Well, that's not all 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.120
 but in any case not 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.190
 more of the youngest chemistry style 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.169
 sentinel and gallier of course with 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.880
 as well as many know so many 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.080
 Well , that's just fine 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.729
 nice the board home jersey bumblebee 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.740
 Conceptual football and where there are cards 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.630
 works just like the rest of this pack 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.700
 good that last year with many of these 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.460
 episode and for the midfielder in the 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.669
 All the while what the tim howard us 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.900
 Here is a team on Lily 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.520
 mangala that I have to feel bad all over 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.500
 Honestly you can say that to everyone 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.580
 If so, let samba know that 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.310
 I'm not likely to wasabi 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.470
 is dark-skinned no he is not 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.070
 Really not recognize the reader 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.740
 agassa monreal bolat and a fitness 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.570
 map and squint and maestro and zfs 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.100
 Of course I take everything back with that 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.139
 quite clearly because something needs the club 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.610
 not actually contracts but I suppose 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.770
 she also cleans up with those cards soon 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.940
 senseless because you are nothing then kathrin 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.080
 the rest of the 332 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.180
 a little something but not synonymous 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.810
 really good all clear discard 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.720
 3,000 climates are still allowed 315 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.270
 plain text with cross and then it was that 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.390
 from this video but great packs 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.310
 open h sa brings us roberto firmino 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.400
 plus a hungary name 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.020
 labovic and ben arfa funny story 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.580
 should he switch to hsv is then 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.370
 now switched to münster or too 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.510
 not that already approaches 22 teams 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.600
 Duties contested in this 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.680
 season for the u 21 of newcastle as 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.000
 duty is considered game but the 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.880
 functional and somehow set that way 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.250
 and stop for hull city and that's why 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.870
 he will not run for Nice 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.570
 all the way back in the future 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.260
 because he signed his contract with newcastle 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.640
 one should not have dissolved 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.160
 because you are a great kassel 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.390
 Club cracker on the gamma simon 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.500
 pegg would not be bad but i would have 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.150
 like to eat on the team here 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.350
 lottery was he is not here 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.850
 not a bad player but also no
