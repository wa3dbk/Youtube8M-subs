this<00:00:05.460> is<00:00:05.580> our<00:00:05.730> new<00:00:05.759> forever<00:00:06.180> Lee<00:00:06.390> installed<00:00:06.960> on

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
this is our new forever Lee installed on

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.840 
this is our new forever Lee installed on
the<00:00:07.259> side<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> building

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.950 

as<00:00:11.850> you<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.180> see<00:00:12.330> our<00:00:12.510> turbines<00:00:12.750> spinning

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
as you can see our turbines spinning

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.760 
as you can see our turbines spinning
right<00:00:13.800> now<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.070> charging<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> batteries<00:00:15.770> for

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
right now and charging the batteries for

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.160 
right now and charging the batteries for
that<00:00:16.920> light

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that light

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.290 

the<00:00:19.710> lightest<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.430> hooked<00:00:20.610> up<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.790> power<00:00:21.030> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the lightest not hooked up to power in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.120 
the lightest not hooked up to power in
any<00:00:21.480> way<00:00:24.020> she's<00:00:25.020> capturing<00:00:25.440> energy<00:00:25.770> from<00:00:26.040> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
any way she's capturing energy from the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:58.050 
any way she's capturing energy from the
wind<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.750> store<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> batteries

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.530 

and<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.520> forever<00:01:00.850> light<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.710> night<00:01:03.540> as

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
and this is a forever light and night as

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.940 
and this is a forever light and night as
you<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:04.870> see<00:01:05.020> you<00:01:05.050> can<00:01:05.200> see<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.530> aerial

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
you can see you can see the aerial

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.730 
you can see you can see the aerial
lights<00:01:06.130> up<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:10.750> can<00:01:10.870> see<00:01:13.380> still<00:01:14.380> spinning

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
lights up as you can see still spinning

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.310 
lights up as you can see still spinning
up<00:01:14.830> they're<00:01:14.980> charging<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.400> batteries<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
up they're charging the batteries and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.240 
up they're charging the batteries and
then<00:01:17.440> light<00:01:17.620> breeze<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.870> light<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.320> 10,000

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
then light breeze this light is 10,000

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.120 
then light breeze this light is 10,000
lumens<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:23.260> see<00:01:23.440> how<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.620> lights<00:01:23.770> up<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.010> side

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
lumens you see how it lights up the side

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.470 
lumens you see how it lights up the side
of<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.280> building<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.440> again<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.160> just

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
of the building and again it's just

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.930 
of the building and again it's just
extracting<00:01:28.480> energy<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.020> wind<00:01:32.940> this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
extracting energy from the wind this

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.250 
extracting energy from the wind this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
batteries and the light I also use high

00:01:45.400 --> 00:02:12.870 
batteries and the light I also use high
intensity<00:01:46.000> LEDs

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.260

now you have a perspective seen in the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.130 
now you have a perspective seen in the
day<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.890> night<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.750> our<00:02:19.870> forever
