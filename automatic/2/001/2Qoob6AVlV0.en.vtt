we<00:00:12.320> have<00:00:12.410> put<00:00:12.620> together<00:00:12.830> a<00:00:13.100> series<00:00:13.490> of<00:00:14.060> extreme

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
we have put together a series of extreme

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.300 
we have put together a series of extreme
clams<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.279> extreme<00:00:17.150> techniques<00:00:18.280> with<00:00:19.280> the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
clams and extreme techniques with the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.550 
clams and extreme techniques with the
help<00:00:19.610> of<00:00:19.700> Darryl<00:00:20.030> Curtis<00:00:20.320> we're<00:00:21.320> going<00:00:21.470> to

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
help of Darryl Curtis we're going to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.859 
help of Darryl Curtis we're going to
start<00:00:21.770> off<00:00:21.890> with<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.039> rock<00:00:22.160> climb<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.910> steep<00:00:23.630> rock

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
start off with a rock climb a steep rock

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.960 
start off with a rock climb a steep rock
climb<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.440> we'll<00:00:25.160> just<00:00:25.310> see<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.580> techniques

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
climb and we'll just see the techniques

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.200 
climb and we'll just see the techniques
involved<00:00:26.420> enjoy

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.869 

a<00:00:31.240> few<00:00:31.720> headland

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
a few headland

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.290 
a few headland
in<00:00:33.969> a<00:00:34.090> specific<00:00:34.440> statement<00:00:35.440> going<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:35.980> be

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in a specific statement going to be

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.869 
in a specific statement going to be
observing<00:00:37.300> Carol<00:00:37.870> they<00:00:38.219> appealed<00:00:39.219> peddling

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
observing Carol they appealed peddling

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.479 
observing Carol they appealed peddling
and<00:00:40.480> that's<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.780> technique<00:00:41.109> that<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.370> us

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
and that's a technique that all of us

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.209 
and that's a technique that all of us
use

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.250 

but<00:00:45.789> all<00:00:45.910> it<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.180> really<00:00:46.539> getting<00:00:46.899> a<00:00:47.079> plea

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
but all it is is really getting a plea

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.360 
but all it is is really getting a plea
appeal<00:00:47.680> or<00:00:47.829> an<00:00:48.430> extreme<00:00:49.050> section<00:00:50.050> without

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
appeal or an extreme section without

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.189 
appeal or an extreme section without
falling<00:00:51.370> over<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:52.059> with<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.329> minimal<00:00:52.719> amount

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
falling over and with a minimal amount

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.700 
falling over and with a minimal amount
of<00:00:53.640> energy<00:00:54.640> usable<00:00:55.149> over<00:00:56.110> here<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.350> can<00:00:56.500> see

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
of energy usable over here you can see

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.939 
of energy usable over here you can see
very<00:00:56.980> very<00:00:57.070> carefully<00:00:57.930> Darrell<00:00:58.930> is<00:00:59.079> adjusting

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
very very carefully Darrell is adjusting

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.610 
very very carefully Darrell is adjusting
and<00:01:00.070> put<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.460> back<00:01:00.780> where<00:01:01.780> he<00:01:01.989> wants<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.350> go

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
and put in the back where he wants to go

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.340 
and put in the back where he wants to go
because<00:01:03.040> if<00:01:03.219> that<00:01:03.339> point<00:01:03.790> in<00:01:03.940> him<00:01:04.350> pedaling

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
because if that point in him pedaling

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.109 
because if that point in him pedaling
and<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:06.070> front<00:01:06.280> wheel<00:01:06.430> going<00:01:06.610> away<00:01:06.729> points<00:01:07.030> to

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
and the front wheel going away points to

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.219 
and the front wheel going away points to
there<00:01:07.270> because<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.600> going<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:07.960> go<00:01:08.049> into

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
there because it is going to go into

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.380 
there because it is going to go into
wrong<00:01:08.380> sections<00:01:08.830> so<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.549> can<00:01:09.700> see<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> careful

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
wrong sections so you can see a careful

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.200 
wrong sections so you can see a careful
to<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.140> front<00:01:11.380> wheel<00:01:11.590> very<00:01:12.220> very<00:01:12.610> light<00:01:12.880> most

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
to the front wheel very very light most

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.480 
to the front wheel very very light most
part<00:01:13.509> in<00:01:14.110> extra<00:01:14.350> fected<00:01:14.619> warmers<00:01:14.860> creates<00:01:15.250> a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
really effect a little bit of a pivot

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.710 
really effect a little bit of a pivot
with<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.580> whole<00:01:18.789> time<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.149> front<00:01:19.300> row<00:01:19.450> has

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
with it the whole time the front row has

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.040 
with it the whole time the front row has
to<00:01:19.869> be<00:01:19.960> light<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.310> also<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:22.090> this<00:01:22.300> specific

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
to be light and also in this specific

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.040 
to be light and also in this specific
technique<00:01:23.920> your<00:01:24.490> majesty<00:01:24.909> thumb<00:01:25.149> goes<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
technique your majesty thumb goes to the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.499 
technique your majesty thumb goes to the
back<00:01:26.229> quite<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> lot<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.270> for<00:01:28.450> a

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
back quite a lot and that is for a

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.029 
back quite a lot and that is for a
specific<00:01:28.720> reason<00:01:29.200> that's<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.679> get<00:01:29.800> traction

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
specific reason that's to get traction

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.770 
specific reason that's to get traction
on<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.310> back<00:01:30.429> wheel<00:01:30.610> look<00:01:30.789> at<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.030> if<00:01:31.690> you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
on the back wheel look at that if you

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.859 
on the back wheel look at that if you
look<00:01:31.929> carefully<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.619> will<00:01:33.280> see<00:01:33.340> him<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.270> cannot

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
look carefully you will see him I cannot

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.279 
look carefully you will see him I cannot
there<00:01:35.229> because<00:01:35.590> all<00:01:36.159> he's<00:01:36.310> doing<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:37.289> lifting

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
there because all he's doing is lifting

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.290 
there because all he's doing is lifting
it<00:01:38.560> after<00:01:38.740> his<00:01:38.860> legs<00:01:39.130> are<00:01:39.310> again<00:01:39.580> but<00:01:40.060> as<00:01:40.179> he

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
it after his legs are again but as he

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300 
it after his legs are again but as he
goes<00:01:40.450> further<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.929> put<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.259> button<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.190> the

goes further and put that button on the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.169 
goes further and put that button on the
back<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.179> use<00:01:43.479> uses<00:01:44.049> short<00:01:44.470> bursts<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.179> buckle

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
see any spinning or any point whether

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.540 
see any spinning or any point whether
where<00:01:53.379> the<00:01:53.470> tire<00:01:53.709> is<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:54.099> spinning<00:01:54.369> and

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
figure out where your tire is and if it

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.300 
figure out where your tire is and if it
is<00:02:02.080> spinning<00:02:02.289> or<00:02:02.530> digging<00:02:02.709> a<00:02:02.860> hole<00:02:03.039> or<00:02:03.220> if

it's<00:02:20.980> obviously<00:02:21.250> gravity<00:02:21.610> works<00:02:21.790> for<00:02:22.030> him

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
it's obviously gravity works for him

it's obviously gravity works for him
it's<00:02:22.840> about<00:02:22.959> pulling<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.620> ball<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:24.010> left

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it's about pulling on the ball to left

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.559 
it's about pulling on the ball to left
it'll<00:02:24.550> actually<00:02:24.730> pull<00:02:25.000> him<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.209> left-hand

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
it'll actually pull him to the left-hand

side he lands the by

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.260 
side he lands the by
he'll<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> very<00:02:30.290> very<00:02:31.030> steep<00:02:32.030> now

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
he'll then get to a very very steep now

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.510 
he'll then get to a very very steep now
doesn't<00:02:32.540> look<00:02:32.720> steep<00:02:33.380> on<00:02:33.530> camera<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:33.950> its

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
doesn't look steep on camera but its

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.480 
doesn't look steep on camera but its
widest<00:02:34.940> part<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.990> incline<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.860> then

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.280 
widest part of the incline and then
there's<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.880> hole<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.270> before<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> rock<00:02:38.810> so

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
there's a hole just before the rock so

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.310 
there's a hole just before the rock so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
seriously extreme climb make you just

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.630 
seriously extreme climb make you just
make<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.980> well<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.100> climb<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.280> one<00:02:52.490> of<00:02:52.550> the
