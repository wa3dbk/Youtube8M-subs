00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.220
When I look up at the sky. I see there.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.720
In that stagnant sky, the stars laid out.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.320
Ah… I’m laughing aren’t I? I am

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.900
Laughing at, sneering and scorning myself.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.100
This twisted self I’ve become.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.400
What was supposed to be a mere trial of intoxication,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.820
Has since become something without which I…

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.720
Cannot even breathe.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.980
I have abandoned, all thought.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.600
By vomiting up all the melancholy

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.000
Running rampant before me, I am somehow able

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.880
To keep myself alive.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.620
I am melting into listlessness.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.440
Hey, Merry.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.560
This reality really is.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.440
Such a fragile and fleeting thing isn’t it?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.180
Like vermin, manipulated, meeting and mating.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.040
Driven by our unconscious instincts, we spread.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.040
Rotting.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.840
I try to fill the holes opened in my heart.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.780
Over and over again.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.700
-But, nothing is ever filled.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560
What…

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.520
do I…?

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.480
What…

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.940
with whom?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.140
Everyone paints and hardens their deceptions,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.500
Painting that face over all that was before.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.520
Deceiving even themselves.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.580
It approaches, silent and secretly.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.340
Perhaps those emotions themselves were

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.680
Only a temporary moment brought on by mischief,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.380
Only an illusion, born from escapism.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.180
Twisting reality.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.900
Hey, myself – my Merry.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.360
This relationship really is.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.960
Such a terrible and vulgar thing, isn’t it?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.900
Like vermin, we fight argue, laid with parasites.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.640
Smiling in shades of night, something is watching me.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.720
Defiled.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.560
Brimming with ecstasy, those eyes.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.600
Speak eloquently to me.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.280
-I won’t let this end, not yet.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.180
What…

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.120
do you…?

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.060
What…

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.640
with whom?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.820
Disappearing, chair after chair, another is stolen away.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:54.420
I cannot find any way to bring them back.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.140
Therefore.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:02.500
Disappearing, chair after chair, another chair I break.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:10.580
That is the only thing I know I can do.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.100
Like vermin, we are controlled, and rot away.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.600
Taking the black of night at the ends of this sickness,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.920
Into our bodies, swollen and impregnated.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.940
Disappearing.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.640
Everything twists and breaks apart.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.680
Without the slightest hint of mercy.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.500
-The Gymnopédie bares its fangs.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.520
What…

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.400
Do I…?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.440
What…

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.320
With whom?

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.320
For now.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.260
There is.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.100
No one.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.660
And nothing.
