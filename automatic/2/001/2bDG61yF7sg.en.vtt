00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 very good people here impact again 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.529
 First of all, apologize for the edition 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.170
 to the video I will not have my data until 6 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.330
 August try to find another way to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.179
 make videos from my cell phone but good 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.699
 I finally found something will be simple but 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.100
 well the important thing is to transmit the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.689
 topic more than everything and as we see is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.050
 enough to use correctly the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 teamviewer I have received comments 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 about how radios use it why 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.160
 use in such a way that the program does not 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.350
 It serves and well let's analyze how 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 use it correctly as you take out a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 good profit is the program that the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.879
 true to those who are in trade 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 it can serve too much not first to know 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.860
 three points not the main point is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.260
 the people who have desktop pc or 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 computers at home obviously by 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.199
 example let's say I have family no no 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.329
 I know three brothers of dad and mom we do not see 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 that I went out for a while with some friends 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 who is crying speaks our part of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.710
 they a while I say would be that it was sold to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.750
 that he is not related that he had or that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.120
 audience of goal or zone 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.500
 to review the good then what I do 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.070
 is sent a text message to a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.229
 familiar or by twitter facebook or as 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.910
 you communicate and asked today that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.190
 dinner like all today on the computer 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.890
 let's say there's no on the computer and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.380
 you answer him, it will not be that you make me 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.990
 10 minutes this connect better than me 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.550
 smartphone and then they simply open 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.619
 the teamviewer I speak from the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.260
 smartphone and I can already see my trade 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.020
 from elsewhere not this does not work 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.759
 too much for those who have at home and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.240
 good but it's a good way to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.100
 take advantage of the program no other 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 with friends let's say we're in the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.960
 university not in my case and a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 university and there are divisions let's say that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.729
 suddenly my laptop was not saying 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.440
 good chin was like lake let's not say 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.440
 an equal friend plays domo only choose 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 closed on your computer do not stop 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.310
 install the teamviewer and good recommended 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 are your auto quota the turn because 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.240
 yes no but it is in classes no but no 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.520
 will occupy the laptop can you simply 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.929
 I say that it removes the laptop it activates the active one 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 teamviewer and I is where I am 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.629
 so I do not know is that I only handle tone 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.159
 It sounded very geeky but I know people who 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.219
 has done that I have received comments 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.400
 of people who have taken over that way 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:27.519
 teamviewer and well it's a good idea not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.469
 never removed and they help you other 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.189
 with family members let's say you have a 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:35.079
 family that in my case in mexico example 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.439
 I have family the df in veracruz in 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.000
 chiapas and well let's say I 'm releasing 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.069
 the program or that the level the vice 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.930
 Download the program both eyes 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.480
 as it has vigor and the evidence has its 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 compass or the tablet or your pc or whatever 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.849
 and then with that I can play myself from 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.470
 here I just see my business not from 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.290
 done that occupy him with friend this of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.810
 colombia that is enemy of team this and 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.439
 Well, we have verified that it works 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.799
 internationally for those 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.569
 people who like this a little bit and 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.609
 well I recommend you mainly 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.340
 for something that is trade in this case 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.620
 sell some sell resources 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.209
 let's say put the message in the chat of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.690
 but such things 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.070
 mp greet her and even 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.730
 I mainly do not recommend it for 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.590
 you fight the truth if you want to make a 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.390
 little fights or even opel them 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.240
 I recommend you can use an iPad or a 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.180
 base tablet all for the space I occupy 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.130
 an iphone 4 the crown 5 that and the space 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.800
 it is very small I recommend it of 5 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.510
 inches at least to make it more 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.030
 taste and when those are the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
 recommendations on how to use it 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.510
 I know it's very short I know it's very 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.520
 simple but the important thing is that the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.560
 people are looking for another way to use the 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.360
 program does not really what's important 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.640
