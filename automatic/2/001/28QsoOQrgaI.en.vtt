it's in a minute fasting a good tool for

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.980 
it's in a minute fasting a good tool for
weight<00:00:02.100> loss<00:00:02.310> or<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.820> it<00:00:02.939> just<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.419> big<00:00:03.689> hype

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
weight loss or is it just a big hype

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.960 
weight loss or is it just a big hype
personally<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:04.980> don't<00:00:05.190> believe<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.790> has

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
personally I don't believe that it has

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.390 
personally I don't believe that it has
magical<00:00:06.660> growth<00:00:06.899> hormone<00:00:07.290> benefits<00:00:07.770> nor<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:08.340> I

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
magical growth hormone benefits nor do I

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.770 
magical growth hormone benefits nor do I
believe<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.910> accelerates<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.599> fat

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
believe that it accelerates a fat

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
believe that it accelerates a fat
burning<00:00:10.110> process<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.679> believe<00:00:11.580> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
burning process I believe that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.370 
burning process I believe that
intermittent<00:00:12.450> fasting<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.840> more<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
intermittent fasting is more so a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.959 
intermittent fasting is more so a
convenience<00:00:13.950> tool<00:00:14.130> rather<00:00:14.670> than<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
convenience tool rather than a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.849 
convenience tool rather than a
physiological<00:00:15.809> tool<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> here's<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
physiological tool and here's what I

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.300 
physiological tool and here's what I
mean

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
mean

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
mean
we<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> weight<00:00:18.300> loss<00:00:18.510> will<00:00:18.779> occur<00:00:18.810> if

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
we know that weight loss will occur if

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.470 
we know that weight loss will occur if
you<00:00:19.500> wheat<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.830> caloric<00:00:20.100> deficit<00:00:20.520> right<00:00:21.000> so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
you wheat in a caloric deficit right so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.599 
you wheat in a caloric deficit right so
we<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> tve<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.800> when<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> go<00:00:23.430> below

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
we all have a tve and when you go below

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.570 
we all have a tve and when you go below
this<00:00:23.850> number<00:00:24.210> weight<00:00:24.960> loss<00:00:25.140> occurs<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:26.340> with

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this number weight loss occurs now with

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.040 
this number weight loss occurs now with
intermittent<00:00:27.000> fasting<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.720> long
