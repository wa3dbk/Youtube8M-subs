00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.140
 Our Lady of Pilar 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.279
 here is where it's done 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.469
 party I misunderstood the biggest in the community 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.510
 in the mountains 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.750
 from Chihuahua 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.910
 extra percent in these ceremonies smn make them

 tourists from abroad and 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.280
