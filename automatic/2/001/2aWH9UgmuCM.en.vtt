00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.700 
water drip through and that's okay but
for<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.600> most<00:02:55.840> part<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.260> don't<00:02:56.380> want<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.650> to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
for the most part you don't want it to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.160 
for the most part you don't want it to
go<00:02:56.800> too<00:02:56.980> fast<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:58.300> we're<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.960> set<00:02:59.080> our

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
go too fast so we're going to set our

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.340 
go too fast so we're going to set our
timer<00:02:59.790> let<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.910> let<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.210> pre-infusion<00:03:01.630> go<00:03:01.930> for

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
timer let it let the pre-infusion go for

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.540 
timer let it let the pre-infusion go for
roughly<00:03:02.710> 30<00:03:03.010> seconds<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.650> then<00:03:06.160> we'll<00:03:06.280> start

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
roughly 30 seconds and then we'll start

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.940 
roughly 30 seconds and then we'll start
our<00:03:06.670> pour<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:10.120> as<00:03:10.210> you<00:03:10.330> watch<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.960> bubbles

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
our pour so as you watch it it bubbles

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.260 
our pour so as you watch it it bubbles
up<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.190> that's<00:03:12.370> basically<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.790> carbon

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
up and that's basically just carbon

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.660 
up and that's basically just carbon
dioxide<00:03:13.660> coming<00:03:13.960> out<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> coffee<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:15.610> is

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
dioxide coming out of the coffee this is

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.520 
dioxide coming out of the coffee this is
a<00:03:15.790> very<00:03:15.970> fresh<00:03:16.300> roast<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.200> going<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.380> go

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
a very fresh roast so it's going to go

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.300 
a very fresh roast so it's going to go
it's<00:03:17.800> going<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.670> quite<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.630> bit<00:03:19.780> more<00:03:19.930> bubbly

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
it's going to be quite a bit more bubbly

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.040 
it's going to be quite a bit more bubbly
than<00:03:22.140> other<00:03:23.140> coffees<00:03:23.760> ideally<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.720> want<00:03:25.960> it

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
than other coffees ideally you want it

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.830 
than other coffees ideally you want it
