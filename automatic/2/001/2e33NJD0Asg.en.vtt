00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
problem so I didn't know how to deal

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.719 
problem so I didn't know how to deal
with<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.509> but<00:01:18.250> gradually<00:01:19.250> every<00:01:19.430> day<00:01:19.549> are

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
with it but gradually every day are

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.730 
with it but gradually every day are
getting<00:01:19.939> better<00:01:20.149> getting<00:01:20.539> stronger<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.500> we're

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
getting better getting stronger so we're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.130 
getting better getting stronger so we're
just<00:01:21.770> hoping<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.600> recovers<00:01:23.600> quickly<00:01:23.840> it

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
just hoping that it recovers quickly it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.130 
just hoping that it recovers quickly it
is<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.490> bit<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.700> smaller<00:01:26.240> time<00:01:26.539> frame<00:01:26.570> than<00:01:27.020> I

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
is a bit of a smaller time frame than I
