00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that I guess all you need for this is

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.730 
that I guess all you need for this is
some<00:01:25.439> pepper<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.479> whatever<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.110> would

some pepper and whatever you have would
be<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:30.409> since<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.560> never<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.920> dishes

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
be good and since we never do dishes

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
be good and since we never do dishes
we're<00:01:32.579> using<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.909> butter<00:01:33.119> knife<00:01:33.180> instead<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> a
