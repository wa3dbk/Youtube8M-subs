hell baby had an ingrown eyelash growing
in<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.499> he<00:00:22.619> thought<00:00:22.919> if<00:00:23.099> I<00:00:23.249> killed<00:00:23.669> who<00:00:24.150> maybe

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
in and he thought if I killed who maybe

in and he thought if I killed who maybe
it<00:00:24.929> will<00:00:25.169> help<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.220> was

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
it will help with this because I was

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.880 
it will help with this because I was
going<00:00:26.489> to<00:00:26.609> blind<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.179> child<00:00:27.509> and<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.649> been

going to blind that child and it's been

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
going to blind that child and it's been
around<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.339> a<00:00:29.460> sense<00:00:29.729> and<00:00:31.759> we<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:33.359> premedicate

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
around in a sense and we we premedicate

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.520 
around in a sense and we we premedicate
the<00:00:34.530> area<00:00:35.039> we<00:00:35.670> take<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.149> any<00:00:36.510> makeup<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.199> we

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the area we take off any makeup and we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.450 
the area we take off any makeup and we
use<00:00:37.800> some<00:00:38.640> witch<00:00:38.850> hazel<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.449> alcohol<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.469> we

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
use some witch hazel or alcohol and we

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
use some witch hazel or alcohol and we
stretch<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.300> area<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:44.550> insert<00:00:45.120> right

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
stretch the area and we insert right

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.869 
stretch the area and we insert right
into<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> fog<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.370> remove<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> hair<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
into the fog and remove the hair and

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.970 
into the fog and remove the hair and
when<00:00:50.879> you're<00:00:51.030> doing<00:00:51.359> electrolysis<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.679> hair

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
when you're doing electrolysis the hair

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.360 
when you're doing electrolysis the hair
should<00:00:53.399> release<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.059> should<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:55.679> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
should release it should not top and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
should release it should not top and
when<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:57.390> take<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.559> root

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
when we take it out you can see the root

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.819 
when we take it out you can see the root
on<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.370> end<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.749> not<00:01:01.019> guesswork

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on the end of it and it is not guesswork

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.940 
on the end of it and it is not guesswork
we<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.879> stage<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.269> growth<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.440> and

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
we know what stage of growth it's in and

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.630 
we know what stage of growth it's in and
that's<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.610> our<00:01:06.380> job<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.310> here

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that's really our job to get you in here

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880 
that's really our job to get you in here
when<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.000> still<00:01:09.240> growing<00:01:09.740> because<00:01:10.740> they

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
when it's still growing because they

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.030 
when it's still growing because they
have<00:01:11.340> three<00:01:11.730> specific<00:01:12.120> different<00:01:13.080> root<00:01:13.710> looks

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
have three specific different root looks

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
have three specific different root looks
and<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> second<00:01:15.330> stage<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> hair<00:01:16.080> has

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and that was a second stage a hair has

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.790 
and that was a second stage a hair has
three<00:01:16.680> stages<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:18.630> feel<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.350> pinch

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
three stages and you feel a little pinch

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.470 
three stages and you feel a little pinch
but<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:20.940> worse<00:01:21.330> than

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
but it's not it's not worse than

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.710 
but it's not it's not worse than
tweezing<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.160 

and<00:01:25.260> we<00:01:25.620> can<00:01:25.800> really<00:01:26.040> move<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.850> lightning

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
and we can really move like lightning

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
and we can really move like lightning
with<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.620> electrolysis<00:01:29.250> Oh<00:01:29.520> 15<00:01:30.030> minutes<00:01:30.420> we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
with the electrolysis Oh 15 minutes we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.730 
with the electrolysis Oh 15 minutes we
can<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:33.120> do<00:01:33.300> a<00:01:33.330> nice<00:01:33.600> clam<00:01:34.080> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
can we can really do a nice clam the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
can we can really do a nice clam the
skin<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.580> pink<00:01:35.940> when<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.300> leave<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
skin is a little pink when you leave it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.970 
skin is a little pink when you leave it
pretty<00:01:38.760> much<00:01:39.000> cancels<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.260> groans<00:01:40.620> the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
pretty much cancels in groans the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.100 
pretty much cancels in groans the
tweezing<00:01:41.660> does<00:01:42.660> cause<00:01:43.190> tweezing<00:01:45.110> because

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
tweezing does cause tweezing because

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770 
tweezing does cause tweezing because
you're<00:01:46.320> ripping<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.800> by<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.070> root<00:01:47.510> tends<00:01:48.510> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you're ripping it by the root tends to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.120 
you're ripping it by the root tends to
cause<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.790> hair<00:01:50.790> roots<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.740> distort<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cause some hair roots to distort and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
cause some hair roots to distort and
then<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.240> happens<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.720> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
then then what happens with that it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.110 
then then what happens with that it's
not<00:01:55.380> growing<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:56.040> straight<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.940> gets

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
not growing out straight so it gets

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.960 
not growing out straight so it gets
trapped<00:01:57.450> under<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> skin<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.730> when

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
trapped under the skin and then when

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.350 
trapped under the skin and then when
we're<00:02:00.180> done<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.050> entire<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.790> always

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we're done the entire we do it we always

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.350 
we're done the entire we do it we always
do<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> cold<00:02:03.930> compress<00:02:04.550> with<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.700> cook<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
do a cold compress with the cook and the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
do a cold compress with the cook and the
reason<00:02:06.750> we're<00:02:06.900> doing<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.230> cold<00:02:07.470> compress<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.190> we

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
reason we're doing a cold compress is we

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.180 
reason we're doing a cold compress is we
want<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.450> blood<00:02:09.810> stimulation<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> leave

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190

and<00:02:24.060> causing<00:02:24.660> blood<00:02:24.870> stimulation<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:25.920> we're

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
and causing blood stimulation so we're

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
and causing blood stimulation so we're
not<00:02:26.430> ripping<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.060> by<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.240> rule<00:02:27.510> we're

not ripping it by the rule we're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.250 
not ripping it by the rule we're
severing<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> cauterizing<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.209> root<00:02:30.480> so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
severing it and cauterizing the root so

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.010 
severing it and cauterizing the root so
it's<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:32.250> able<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> make<00:02:33.120> another<00:02:33.450> hair<00:02:33.810> in
