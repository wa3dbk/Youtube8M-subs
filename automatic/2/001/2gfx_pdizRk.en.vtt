00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello today i am making dolls stormy 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.550
 retro styling 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 I want to say that we will cheat 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.530
 hair at the roots so try 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.269
 Do not overheat your swagger 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 so that it doesn't work out for you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.130
 me and since it happened with that girl 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.449
 for example this here you see this is not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.020
 children's hairs 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.820
 This is Julia just went through a little 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.910
 I want to say that for more such 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 smooth lines of light lukans 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 would use a wider curling 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.250
 type here such here at me with the regulator 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 temperatures 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.960
 very comfortable but this curling is not for everyone 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 there is therefore I will use my 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 old with a standard radius 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.789
 vitek curling bread here I have it 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.489
 old woman still school abundance 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.770
 used it for a long time so 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.949
 to create the volume of such a little bit on 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.529
 wet hair, I applied foam dried 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.259
 head over head, don't forget 

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:09.479
 of course i protect my hair 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.880
 put her standard set and this 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 Of course balm while washing 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 some kind of protective serum also 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.689
 a little oil has inflicted a little 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.529
 we will cool our curls so do 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.909
 I decided many professionals too 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.340
 little indulge in order to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.880
 fix them I cooked a lot a lot 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.979
 such invisible women that cost 5 kopecks 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.829
 but they are very necessary and they are very much for us 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 help well for a start the whole thing 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.240
 gently combing so rare 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.119
 comb 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.859
 drying were already lunge firing burned out 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.649
 after that it was a little okay 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.639
 combed and now you need to divide them into 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.430
 side parting 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:57.050
 I have my parting myself on 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.580
 will enter until this is the main part of the hair to us 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.340
 no need we'll deal 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.960
 here is this little part if by 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.140
 my example you want a little bit 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.289
 cool your curls and fix them 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.340
 already prepare your do not trouble point or 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.410
 your clamping chick take a strand of hair I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.150
 I love to read my hair before 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.980
 styling 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 I must say of course my drying shaft already 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.660
 pretty longish for this 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.930
 tab will be better with more carriage wasps and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.410
 raise to create volume 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.410
 bring the roots of our crust and steeper 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:52.830
 and keep sewing a little more drying 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:55.560
 spinning the roots of the mind a finger immediately him 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:00.890
 I downloaded my pryadochka and now I want it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.890
 to cool invisible for cooling 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.100
 if you need more, you can support him 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.060
 so well kept this 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:20.900
 it turned out 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:24.020
 yulechka go further next strand such 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.960
 bullshit and culture shaved narrow here 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:33.460
 its finger and our strand on it itself 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.460
 is famous for fixing the invisible 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.260
 so now turn to the main part all 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:47.090
 It is the same shelf trays root 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.720
 a bunch of them while the shelf is also familiar with tea 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.720
 hold until light up 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.100
 it would be desirable, too, so do not 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.840
 to set fire to the hands was removed on a finger and 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.640
 fixed to start all this 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.010
 consolidation of course may seem 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.800
 dreary boring is not necessary 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.810
 do of course but if I get my hand 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.900
 it seems it will get very fast 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.900
 and easy 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.210
 we have emptied the lock with our finger 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120
 here's a daisy 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.890
 Well, now I turn to my bottom 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.800
 hair first additional time 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.000
 plyknulo oiling ideally of course you need 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:40.220
 all hair so fix for cooling 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.470
 the tips also hold you can still 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.370
 simplify the task and now i will 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.370
 continue in the same spirit with the help of 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.370
 ironing 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:06.820
 we twist something inside what concerns 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.770
 the volume of our stocking zones is of course 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.480
 here without a curtain does not fix and here already 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.290
 you can imagine a little bit of this whole thing 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.290
 simplify 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:29.380
 fame walking then all here on his ears 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.390
 Well wound from the bottom of course you need 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.110
 begin to spin anyway and then 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.110
 my hair is all confused 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.169
 I'll be here first to lay this first 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.169
 part of which I plan to take back 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.900

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.330
 well and if you do this hairstyle on 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.720
 some evening you can 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:08.599

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:11.770

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.759
 hair inside 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.580
 and naturally I want to add here 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.420
