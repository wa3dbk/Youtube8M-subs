00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
chose this exam because most of the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.230 
chose this exam because most of the
diagnosis<00:01:52.650> comes<00:01:52.830> through<00:01:53.240> radiography

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

which is what I'm involved in a lot of

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.660 
which is what I'm involved in a lot of
the<00:01:57.870> diseases<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.440> rare<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.040> thought<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.400> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the diseases are rare but I thought if I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.960 
the diseases are rare but I thought if I
actually<00:02:00.420> had<00:02:00.750> seen<00:02:01.160> non<00:02:02.160> accidental<00:02:02.370> injury

actually had seen non accidental injury

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.420 
actually had seen non accidental injury
I'd<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.360> able<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> differentiate<00:02:04.160> between<00:02:05.160> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
I'd be able to differentiate between the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
I'd be able to differentiate between the
two<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.990> picked<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.170> disease<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:08.010> it<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
two I picked this disease because it is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880 
two I picked this disease because it is
very<00:02:08.690> it's<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.020> common<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
very it's not very common a lot of

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.560 
very it's not very common a lot of
people<00:02:10.979> picked<00:02:11.430> ones<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.760> are<00:02:11.880> more<00:02:12.180> common

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
people picked ones that are more common

people picked ones that are more common
more<00:02:12.720> commonly<00:02:13.020> seen<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.320> wonder<00:02:13.530> something

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
more commonly seen I wonder something

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370

throughout<00:03:46.390> those<00:03:46.599> programs<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.140> do<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.500> to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
throughout those programs you do have to

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.930 
throughout those programs you do have to
do<00:03:48.700> projects<00:03:49.390> such<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.230> good

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
do projects such as this and it's good

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.300 
do projects such as this and it's good
practice<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.959> gives<00:03:53.109> us<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.350> chance<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.739> kind<00:03:54.220> of

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
practice it gives us a chance to kind of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.039 
practice it gives us a chance to kind of
research<00:03:54.579> into<00:03:54.850> some<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.209> pathology<00:03:55.720> see

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
research into some of the pathology see

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.390 
research into some of the pathology see
what<00:03:56.170> everybody<00:03:56.470> else<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.709> researched<00:03:57.100> and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
what everybody else is researched and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800 
what everybody else is researched and
gives<00:03:58.000> us<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.150> little<00:03:58.239> bit<00:03:58.389> better<00:03:58.510> background

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
gives us a little bit better background

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.650 
gives us a little bit better background
on<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.799> things<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.220> out<00:04:00.310> there<00:04:00.660> c.o.d

program<00:04:02.019> is<00:04:02.139> very<00:04:02.350> good<00:04:02.920> program<00:04:03.130> it's<00:04:03.819> an

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
program is very good program it's an

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.330 
program is very good program it's an
intense<00:04:04.870> program<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.650> covers<00:04:05.829> everything

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
intense program that covers everything

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.270 
intense program that covers everything
for<00:04:06.639> pathology<00:04:07.480> which<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.590> what<00:04:08.739> this<00:04:08.920> project

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
for pathology which is what this project

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.780 
for pathology which is what this project
is<00:04:09.609> based<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.780> as<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.950> physics<00:04:12.370> which<00:04:12.609> is

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
is based on and as to physics which is

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.240 
is based on and as to physics which is
the<00:04:13.030> physics<00:04:13.329> behind<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:14.049> rating<00:04:14.410> radiation

the physics behind the rating radiation
that<00:04:15.430> we're<00:04:15.609> working<00:04:16.090> with<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:17.139> I<00:04:17.169> enjoy<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
that we're working with so I enjoy the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.839 
that we're working with so I enjoy the
fact<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.950> they<00:04:18.160> cover<00:04:18.400> it's<00:04:18.700> a

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
fact that they cover it's a

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.779 
fact that they cover it's a
all-encompassing<00:04:19.389> program<00:04:20.200> as<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:21.370> not<00:04:21.549> just

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
all-encompassing program as and not just

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.750 
all-encompassing program as and not just
the<00:04:21.940> clinical<00:04:22.389> at<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.960> site<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:24.250> instructors

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
the clinical at the site the instructors

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.379 
the clinical at the site the instructors
are<00:04:24.970> very<00:04:25.510> well<00:04:26.229> qualified<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:27.550> PhD<00:04:28.060> and

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
are very well qualified the PhD and

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.420 
are very well qualified the PhD and
have<00:04:30.560> successful<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.680> other<00:04:31.800> fields<00:04:32.040> as<00:04:32.370> well

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
have successful in other fields as well

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.510 
have successful in other fields as well
so<00:04:33.060> it's<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.720> great<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.620> teachers<00:04:35.340> that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
so it's it's great to have teachers that
