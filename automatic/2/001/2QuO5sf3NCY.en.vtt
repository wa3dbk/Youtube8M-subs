quick one two minutes tops and it's how

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.790 
quick one two minutes tops and it's how
to<00:00:13.769> create<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> crescendo<00:00:14.929> type<00:00:15.929> effect<00:00:16.470> that's

to create a crescendo type effect that's
that<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.070> hear<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.760> dance<00:00:18.029> music

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

where you have that snare drum that gets

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.820 
where you have that snare drum that gets
repeated<00:00:20.990> what<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> show<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.560> how

you can see it now looking at the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.270 
you can see it now looking at the
waveform<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.570> play<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.320> you'll<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:35.040> that
