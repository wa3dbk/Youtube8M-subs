00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
things are held in by something so we're

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.040 
things are held in by something so we're
not<00:02:30.100> sure<00:02:30.400> exactly<00:02:30.550> what's<00:02:31.270> holding<00:02:31.660> these<00:02:31.780> in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
not sure exactly what's holding these in

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.080 
not sure exactly what's holding these in
because<00:02:32.290> they're<00:02:32.470> not<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.760> these<00:02:33.880> two

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
because they're not so but these two

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.360 
because they're not so but these two
cars<00:02:34.360> clip<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.780> there<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:35.740> seatbelt
