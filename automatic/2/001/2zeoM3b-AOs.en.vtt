00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.860
 in my second video course will be and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 you are first your own own 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:31.650

 in part on the way to ourselves 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:54.420
 or to our own style 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:58.760
 the us then concludes or ours

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.640
 almost the paper lighter 1 200 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:36.000
 gram per head happens when applying 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 glazes that yours should be 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.160
 once comes with a mix of water 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.600
 and a tiny splash of detergent 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:52.409
 rub in and then with a soft 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 so dream should strongly hold it 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.310
 breakdown with pieces of paper pieces away 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.630
