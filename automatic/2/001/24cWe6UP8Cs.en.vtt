00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.089
 and with great enthusiasm the amateur competition was held 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 like category 0 to 2 thousand homes over 2000 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.779
 public when the torn and the Libyan people are removed by problems 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.249
 labor 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.269
 the two magistrates with their powerful sector 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.150
 they are going to have there 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.739
 Several of them 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.730
 it is above all those that were 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.089
 the porsche 911 in the first places 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.130
 I watched 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.160
 in the red vehicle the number 18 drowned 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 a porsche 911 víctor hugo 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.980
 since 1991 that has 3,600 cubic centimeters and achieved 1 450 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.930
 horsepower 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 He followed about 20 points in a row 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.360
 valera the number five of putting 4 july velarde 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.850
 received 9 8 had coal owner zero sum 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.230
 with the 9th company 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.620
 franklin durán 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.650
 group 8 with 9 9 3 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.610
 and we also saw how michelena with in this item ampuero 17 like this and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.030
 practically the battle between all the vehicles 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.620
 porsche 911 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.469
 be the strong ones in the course of this competition since they gave quite a fight 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:15.770
 and something very interesting euros 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.660
 for that one presented a lady 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.760
 in this competition milka duno who was with the defaulter let's be 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.990
 talking about it, he contrasted this competition and we reiterated on the screen what 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.800
 that characterizes today this competition that will be a fight gave him 18 cowen 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.640
 agosti 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.820
 josé luis valera 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.799
 the development of this cup amateur competition 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.810
 luke the crazy 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.610
 sponsored by kaiser motor of venezuela 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.890
 justly 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.510
 there's a lot of enthusiasm january in the audience 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.760
 there are those who just when 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.220
 juan michelena with his 20ma leaves the track but managed to dominate the vehicle 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.740
 despite having given the reason 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.870
 a long way 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.220
 very dangerous for very high speed 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.800
 in him in the main straight of this circuit and Juan michelena could work 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.849
 colo colo return to the track continue with this team and they leave you 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.310
 the super 7 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 a vehicle although it manufactured lotus to have it screen mutually manufactured 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
 lotus from 58 to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.939
 74 but now he was producing it 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.179
 what interesting 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.990
 to make the pilots 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.699
 from 1907 the repetition 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.560
 it seems that he served 1 two courses he did 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.579
 juan michelena as a barber writer 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.739
 i allowed this what 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.930
 without setbacks he kept back in the competition 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:43.119
 but quite dangerous enough 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.339
 and the fight seems to be very slow the number 18 or good but already 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.719
 is 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.580
 over 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.819
 josé luis valera with numbers 5 attacking 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.459
 and says it does not just have a seal 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.310
 the number 18 this allowed huánuco josé luis valera to approach but not no 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.099
 I know both are vehicles 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.949
 the same are víctor hugo 9 11 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.440
 the high power 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.260
 for more than 450 horsepower and how much that much but keeps and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.970
 new it seems that something like this of michael was he likes to walk around the branches 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.159
 in his vehicle manages to master it again since we are back with lund 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.390
 it was centered 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.349
 is 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.680
 in competition this letter between 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.129
 the favor 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.129
 Number 18 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.849
 in the sale of insurance 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.849
 in it prob 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.979
 for that reason 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.109
 percent 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:40.950
 jury 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.009
 and from what 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.439
 there they are, I think the difference between these pilots is being done by the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.529
 alirón that posse the 911 biturbo the number 18 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.580
 there d this a little while ago 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.750
 on screen but not only all this 911 bag also 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.839
 they had two 9 4 4 that they just saw 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.369
 9 9 3 and the telcel super cup for it 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.909
 the double summit of m3 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.159
 the world are three of them 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.479
 two corvettes 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.299
 a camaro 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.099
 toyota on r2 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.259
 a total of 17 vehicles that delighted the public and is real in 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.430
 reality cease fire 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.039
 very exciting to see 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.389
 to this act cited in quotes because most of them are in the process of handling 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.550
 the interesting thing that takes care of your vehicle and is done 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.909
 no way 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.709
 muigai caballerosa the one that starts in the current positions are respected 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.960
 however it is observed that the country competitiveness 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.930
 and especially with demonstrating 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.010
 it's all pilot favoring magicians like number 18 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.670
 i with valera service 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.990
 com number five being colorful this participation the amateur 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.040
 so I think that one that sortu agrees with me 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.419
 in those r competition most frequent fans where it would be allowed 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.250
 this 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.339
 categories 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.690
 perhaps more balance to the public that would like to be competing 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.240
 and not for example started as 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.080
 vehicle 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.290
 that we see on the screen the how of rapa 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.389
 power causing will enter the main straight but i try 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.050
 after reaching it to deny it 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.169
 to the main straight and I think he's going to achieve it and we see him on the screen 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:20.820
 mounts 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.810
 will still be demolished by the internal part there we see how to explode 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.320
 I guess go keep it now 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.689
 stealing him was first in the first place 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.670
 below are the same excellent handling maneuver 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.999
 in which they will see the repetition 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:36.710
 when it closes again 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.160
 lee is vital crossing in him this first curve he can brake it enough he knows 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.120
 who has it on the left side and then prepares to 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.370
 enter the seen 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.150
 haiti again when you will see something I think you had a problem at that time 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.689
 eye forced the machine or as criminal gat the vehicle ec 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.969
 much more crime but remains in competition all ways 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.809
 Now it is without problems from the same vehicle servo section 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:05.779
 camera door 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:10.460
 in the part the back straight of the circuit with another pump the policy to 

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:11.189
 Cuba 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.379
 as he josé luis sáez 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.669
 valera engel the first place and has a daughter 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.650
 milka duno as number 2 my client 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:22.729
 level 3 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.039
 that has a delay 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.740
 spectrum nor that this automatic but nevertheless failed to pass a quantity 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.180
 of injured 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.349
 showing that he has a 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.439
 r high 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.309
 experience or at least sufficient knowledge of handling 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:41.619
 as to rub shoulders with Christ other pilots 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:46.210
 and good already practically removed from the race by the power chaos pilot with 1 

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.870
 18 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.569
 Follow number 5 is released by not passing some stragglers 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.189
 while and riding on 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:55.439

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.699
 also off the track 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.220
 but without a doubt that 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.990
 great show have given this number 5 that we have on screen i power cause 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.619
 with the number 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:06.560
