00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.980
 well we continue we are in our 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140
 third block let me tell you that we're going to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.090
 talk specifically about the proposal that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.700
 did they wanted the mediators but more 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.140
 that that the answer of the main 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.340
 gangs of leaders of the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 major gangs in our country 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.450
 I read two important things verbatim 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.739
 says that we have had knowledge of the 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.989
 proposal given by the facilitators 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.150
 by his pronouncement to the nation 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.370
 fact published on November 22 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.860
 just happened not because of that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.739
 obviously the gangs emit this 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.839
 statement says in the literal we accept 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.550
 fully the proposal submitted by 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.330
 the facilitators in as much represents 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.059
 a realistic and objective way of how to go 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.089
 approaching the solution as trace says 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.250
 a roadmap that possibly what 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.890
 makes it possible to say that gradually 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.370
 progressively resolves 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.600
 national problem b says that for 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.270
 advance rather in the creation of the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.860
 proposal we have delivered privately to 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.049
 the facilitators a first list of 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.150
 10 municipalities in which we already 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.100
 We are ready to implement the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.260
 process municipalities in which they live 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.780
 an average of 900 thousand inhabitants 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.880
 literally it is said in order to contribute in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.590
 the dynamics of the process we announce that 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.290
 we are already withdrawing from those municipalities 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 the armament of our clinics the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.840
 which will be delivered soon to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.860
 the facilitators let's talk about this 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.780
 with Carlos Mojica Carlos and 10 municipalities 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.760
 is the first list that you submit 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.330
 to the authorities we can talk about those 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.330
 10 municipalities 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.950
 in a way 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 widespread 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.320
 you can not say reveal the names of 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.500
 those days for reasons obviously of 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:06.820
 security for this process and in are of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.530
 not give tools to detractors 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.140
 of the process because we know there are 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.709
 we prefer to make them known in their 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.470
 moment have been announced by the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.810
 facilitators 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.960
 what characteristics do those 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.960
 municipalities 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.030
 and well we think they are 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.030
 and affected municipalities 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.830
 where prevails the more the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.190
 illicit of having committed but the 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.710
 gang this one 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.670
 where we have a good number of 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.740
 comrades of both gangs true 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.670
 We believe that 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.640
 are the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.580
 the priority ones by the beginning will be a 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.130
 territory where 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.850
 the leaders I say the gang members 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.580
 gang members are at peace 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.140
 live in peace 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.270
 itself when I want to clarify soul 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.910
 we have been listening to the term 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.240
 sanctuary 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.920
 in this I do not know how it is that this went out to 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.430
 I do not know how it is that it has been given 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.870
 this is has become popular in these 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.360
 last days the term sanctuary 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.630
 we believe that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.450
 that is a wrong term a sanctuary 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.840
 we consider it as a refuge in 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.150
 truth is not refuge what we are looking for 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.890
 we are really looking to reinsert ourselves 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.329
 reinsert our partner in 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.500
 freedom popularize this process 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.409
 reconcile with communities 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.010
 local really not for this 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.959
 obviously we need participation 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.579
 from the local leaders true the lasers 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.380
 thinking by mayors religious leaders 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:09.370
 really and we have even asked 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.730
 We made a call to the police 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.870
 local commissioner 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.940
 body is spoken to listen is not going to 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.049
 treat as more officials in the 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.549
 sanctuary territories as is the 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.260
 your proposal that they will live there 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.110
 the gang members that nobody is going to bother 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.030
 that the police will not arrive 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.220
 nobody is fine that there will not be in 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.260
 vendettas among the same gang knew 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.660
 the interior of that municipality explaining 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.860
 a little bit of this I want to ask you 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.750
 that we definitely discard the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.750
 term of current municipalities 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.639
 what is the situation 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.190
 we identify them as municipalities 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.259
 free of violence truth either 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.400
 we're fine we're not asking you not to 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:00.889
 come the police truth we are not either 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.639
 saying that we are going to take out an umbrella 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:08.180
 and we will be there to remain without 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.699
 do it the goal of this is 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.630
 and let our companions be allowed 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:18.650
 in freedom to work 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.660
 without being bothered by the police truth 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.900
 without being bothered by having a tattoo 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.310
 or if a member of a gang that has 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.540
 committed an illegal or a violation 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.300
 etc 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.039
 we are the first to ask the 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.669
 advertising that takes letters in the matter 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:37.220
 no or we are not we do not pretend to come 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.800
 to tell people impunity this 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.419
 they say but this smells to me that it's a 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.430
 concession to impunity for 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.630
 gangs yes but it's because maybe they have 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.190
 perceived badly is this idea the idea does not 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.669
 is that the police stop pursuing 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.040
 the illegal truth if there is a companion 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.140
 our who committed a crime then 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.060
 that they capture it and that they send us 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.260
 respective tribunes but that means 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.040
 expensive but why bother those 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 colleagues who are giving samples 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.870
 palpable of wanting to change your love 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.440
 reinsert lessons from some hole 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.150
 to your life because you beat him because 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.710
 to take it simply by the fact 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.150
 to carry a tattoo, that's true , but that's 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.430
 means that extortions carlos 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.810
 they also go into this in that package and 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.450
 people keep saying 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.490
 I'm still being extorted, I'm still 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.710
 being good the same entrepreneurs of 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.080
 buses do not report at every moment that 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.670
 that increase even the subject of the 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.890
 rent that today they are asking you more 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.660
 etcetera that topic how are you going to handle 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.160
 in the end what is your proposal 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.990
 what is your great respect to 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.760
 that good we can not 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.490
 I can not talk to you about the 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.230
 extortions committed by the police 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.280
 true because we know that there is advertising 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:58.770
 extorting people in the streets 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.680
 there is work already identified 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.550
 policemen and we know there are cops 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.550
 extorting on behalf of gangs 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.690
 as for the municipalities that are 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.080
 declared in free municipalities of 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:16.230
 violence not only violence but 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.610
 of all illicit we do not consider 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.939
 what 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.259
 the fact of providing jobs to 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.629
 our partners give them the 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.430
 opportunity to prove that 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:31.849
 truly want a change that 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:34.520
 it would be a the beginning 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:36.110
 of a gradual procedure for the 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.819
 eradication of exclusion to the face that 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.529
 make the last break when we return 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:41.119
 we have nothing else about three minutes we go 

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:43.039
 to talk about if this process has already started 

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:45.400
 of the withdrawal of weapons that you say of 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:49.270
 these municipalities that would be declared 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.650
 to see territories of peace and good things 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.790
 to pass if this does not work in the end 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.790
 we are going to come back
