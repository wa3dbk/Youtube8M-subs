00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we did it because I think it was a it

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.090 
we did it because I think it was a it
was<00:00:14.849> great<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> fence<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.859> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
was great for the fence to be here and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.090 
was great for the fence to be here and
celebrate<00:00:17.430> again<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.270> goal<00:00:19.020> after<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.650> 42

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
celebrate again a goal after just 42

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.240 
celebrate again a goal after just 42
seconds<00:00:21.029> into<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:22.050> game<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.529> helpful<00:00:22.890> was

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
seconds into the game how helpful was

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.900 
seconds into the game how helpful was
that<00:00:23.820> illegal<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.609> early<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
that illegal I think the early go is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.630 
that illegal I think the early go is
always<00:00:27.210> important<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.109> also<00:00:28.590> today<00:00:29.099> we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
always important is and also today we

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
always important is and also today we
score<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> second<00:00:30.960> minute<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
score in the in the second minute I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
score in the in the second minute I
don't<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.850> that<00:00:32.850> gave<00:00:33.090> us<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> lot<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
don't know and that gave us a lot of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
don't know and that gave us a lot of
confidence<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> rest<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
confidence for the for the rest of the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
confidence for the for the rest of the
game<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.930> could<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.890> could<00:00:38.040> score

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
game and I think we could we could score

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
game and I think we could we could score
another<00:00:38.550> another<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.750> two<00:00:39.899> goes<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
another another one or two goes in the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500 
another another one or two goes in the
first<00:00:40.739> 20<00:00:41.100> minutes<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.230> didn't<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
first 20 minutes but we didn't do it and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
first 20 minutes but we didn't do it and
but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.960> control<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> game<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
but I think we control the game and it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760 
but I think we control the game and it
was<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.879> us<00:00:48.270> today<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.500> scored

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
was all about us today then we we scored

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
was all about us today then we we scored
another<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> second<00:00:50.820> half<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
another two in the second half and it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.959 
another two in the second half and it
was<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> plan<00:00:52.949> adding<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.789> in

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
was it was that the plan adding to go in

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
was it was that the plan adding to go in
and<00:00:54.149> try<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> hurt<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.230> early<00:00:55.620> as

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and try and hurt them as early as

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.930 
and try and hurt them as early as
possible<00:00:55.949> yeah<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.090> always<00:00:57.270> planned<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
possible yeah that's always planned and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
possible yeah that's always planned and
sometimes<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> squirrely<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> sometimes<00:01:01.199> not

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
sometimes you squirrely go sometimes not

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
sometimes you squirrely go sometimes not
but<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.039> did<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> today<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.049> it<00:01:04.049> was

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
but I think we did it today and it was

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.469 
but I think we did it today and it was
great<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.650> start<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> goal<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:05.760> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
great to start with the goal and then we

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
great to start with the goal and then we
tried<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> add<00:01:06.960> another<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.470> what<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> did

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.840 
everybody feeling after that yeah we
knew<00:01:45.600> before<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> game<00:01:46.260> that<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.800> a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
knew before the game that this was a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.550 
knew before the game that this was a
important<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.030> specially<00:01:48.540> after<00:01:48.690> because

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
important game specially after because

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.760 
important game specially after because
we<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.910> have<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> beer<00:01:51.660> still<00:01:51.990> three

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
we know it's we have a beer still three

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.430 
we know it's we have a beer still three
games<00:01:53.010> less<00:01:53.310> than<00:01:53.580> ten<00:01:54.330> Chelsea<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.200> think

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
games less than ten Chelsea and I think

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.340 
games less than ten Chelsea and I think
this<00:01:55.800> game<00:01:56.040> was<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> crucial<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:57.870> add<00:01:57.990> another

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this game was a crucial to add another

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.200 
this game was a crucial to add another
three<00:01:58.860> points<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.400> now<00:01:59.550> we<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.760> only<00:01:59.940> three
