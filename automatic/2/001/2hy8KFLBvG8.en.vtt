00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.169
 m now you need to press the button those that are from 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.200
 for low resolution I have hidden 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.579
 down below 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.349
 or do not need to click 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.609
 I don't seem to need 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.289
 but do not mean look will continue 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.320
 is it all setting or not 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.800
 the passage 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.079
 under 1 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 mean all such 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.449
 all the same here probably still need 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.369
 was push 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.819
 or what 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:31.949
 such 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.130
 to 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
 now 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 he and cancel 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.900
 Now it is more permission 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.050
 i.e 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.260
 here here 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 so here 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 and here we are again but by 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.000
 quick 3 with the mood 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.700
 film product 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.690
 dandruff left right down 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.430
 so so so so 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.610
 how so 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 since the park 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 let's say a turk 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.640
 we do tass 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.540
 it seems we now have it too 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.050
 apply such 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.020
 with management seems everything 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 Well, try to start the game probably try 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.510
 pretend to pretend that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.530
 rub when recording video is simple to match with 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.350
 pretty much 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 Doll 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.450
 Well, I do not know, but now you will see 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.790
 six hundred ofps 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 and as soon as they begin 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.720
 accordingly the course of this process 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.090
 take place 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.070
 they can fall but now we see how 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 This will be the first time I write in Comstar case 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.849
 make short work they don't even disappear like us 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.849
 see 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.120
 unless the court helps you here 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 do you hear 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.879
 for female obesity female 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.879
 skip 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.609
 ipo 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.499
 now the gameplay here you see 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.710
 43 39 44 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.899
 but with legs 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.139
 in general, that 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.400
 fall in poetry ambush 7 regions 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.639
 we see 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.759
 but without it I 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.909
 I am sure that the device will be much better 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.549
 now he is much better now 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 our goal is not only with one field 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.309
 on canvases 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.229
 generally 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.509
 wander everything works 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.969
 fifty sixty ofps 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.399
 in general, all that about what I said gums that 

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.989
 also requires it powerful enough 

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:40.840
 computer 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.419
 how realistic are processors via 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.419
 five 250 500 dogs 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.419
 that's how it is before trial
