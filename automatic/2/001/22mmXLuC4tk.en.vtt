this<00:00:08.040> device<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:10.610> simple<00:00:11.610> traveling

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
this device here is a simple traveling

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.710 
this device here is a simple traveling
used<00:00:13.250> by<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.520> farmer

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
used by a farmer

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.540 
used by a farmer
to<00:00:14.870> access<00:00:15.050> a<00:00:16.029> key<00:00:17.029> field<00:00:17.300> across<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.020> river

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
to access a key field across the river

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.660 
to access a key field across the river
you<00:00:19.550> see<00:00:19.760> how<00:00:19.910> it<00:00:20.090> has<00:00:20.270> a<00:00:20.300> little<00:00:20.450> left<00:00:21.670> section

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
you see how it has a little left section

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.240 
you see how it has a little left section
there<00:00:23.000> for<00:00:23.300> baking<00:00:23.810> goods<00:00:24.200> perhaps<00:00:24.740> people<00:00:24.980> as

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
there for baking goods perhaps people as

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.910 
there for baking goods perhaps people as
well<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:26.480> then<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.430> pulley<00:00:28.430> system<00:00:28.880> or<00:00:29.390> the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
well and then the pulley system or the

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.780 
well and then the pulley system or the
wheels<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.220> tables<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:32.559> think<00:00:33.559> it's<00:00:33.680> a<00:00:33.890> parent

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
wheels and tables I think it's a parent

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.330 
wheels and tables I think it's a parent
pole<00:00:35.000> there's<00:00:35.480> no<00:00:35.629> motor<00:00:35.870> involved<00:00:36.440> who<00:00:37.129> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
pole there's no motor involved who the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.619 
pole there's no motor involved who the
operator<00:00:37.879> would<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.180> have<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.390> pull

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
operator would just have to pull

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.020 
operator would just have to pull
themselves<00:00:38.840> along<00:00:39.379> somehow<00:00:39.850> but<00:00:40.850> what<00:00:41.000> I

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
themselves along somehow but what I

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.640 
themselves along somehow but what I
found<00:00:41.210> interesting<00:00:41.449> -<00:00:42.290> it<00:00:42.410> spins<00:00:43.160> all

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.490 

reaches<00:00:47.650> all<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.920> way<00:00:48.070> over<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:50.020> across

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
reaches all the way over there across

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.570 
reaches all the way over there across
the<00:00:50.740> river

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
the river

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.990 
the river
I<00:00:51.610> want<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.600> show<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:54.340> little<00:00:54.520> system<00:00:54.880> is

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
I want to show you this little system is

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.420 
I want to show you this little system is
interesting<00:00:55.450> if<00:00:55.630> it<00:00:55.720> keeps<00:00:55.990> on<00:00:56.200> right<00:00:56.440> there's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
interesting if it keeps on right there's

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.100 
interesting if it keeps on right there's
one<00:00:57.580> little<00:00:57.700> part<00:00:58.060> that<00:00:58.270> really<00:00:58.420> caught<00:00:59.080> my

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
one little part that really caught my

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.990 
one little part that really caught my
eye

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
eye

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.820 
eye
see<00:01:01.000> how<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:03.270> receiving<00:01:04.270> end

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
see how it is the receiving end

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.420 
see how it is the receiving end
across<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.700> river

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.730 

stone<00:01:12.030> face<00:01:13.430> hitting<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> key<00:01:14.700> field<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> busy

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stone face hitting the key field so busy

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.800 
stone face hitting the key field so busy
what<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.010> caught<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.520> pickle<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.450> all

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
what really caught me on pickle what all

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
what really caught me on pickle what all
of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> wire<00:01:19.710> back

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.080 

over<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.890> upper<00:01:25.190> wired<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.640> little<00:01:25.670> elastic

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
over the upper wired a little elastic

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.660 
over the upper wired a little elastic
the<00:01:26.450> lower<00:01:26.600> wires<00:01:26.930> between<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:28.490> lower<00:01:28.880> wire

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
the lower wires between the lower wire

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.750 
the lower wires between the lower wire
and<00:01:31.670> above<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.510> if<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.190> wire<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:34.670> little

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
and above it if you up the wire a little

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.440 
and above it if you up the wire a little
hard<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.150> make<00:01:35.180> out

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

anyways<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> wires<00:01:43.619> come<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:45.090> are

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
anyways the wires come here they are

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.620 
anyways the wires come here they are
held<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.850> with<00:01:47.850> interest<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> support

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
held up with interest and support

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.990 
held up with interest and support
is<00:01:50.899> poor

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000

you<00:01:53.870> go<00:01:54.020> down<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.620> might<00:01:54.800> see<00:01:55.010> something

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
you go down you might see something

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.490 
you go down you might see something
interesting<00:01:55.970> about<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.780> poll<00:01:56.990> look<00:01:57.290> at<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
interesting about the poll look at the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.910

anyway<00:02:06.530> look<00:02:06.680> at<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.920> poll<00:02:07.190> what<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.610> it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
anyway look at this poll what is it

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.820 
anyway look at this poll what is it
about<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.060> poll<00:02:08.360> that's<00:02:08.600> striking<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
about the poll that's striking in a
