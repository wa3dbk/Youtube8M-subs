00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
document so for this demo we'll try

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.569 
document so for this demo we'll try
Turbo<00:00:42.270> skin<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> dimly<00:00:44.399> lit<00:00:44.550> room

Turbo skin and I'm in a dimly lit room
so<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.640> might<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:47.879> work<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.420> because

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
so it might not work as well because

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260 
so it might not work as well because
adequate<00:00:49.950> lighting<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.430> important<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.090> we'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
adequate lighting is important but we'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
adequate lighting is important but we'll
use<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> fast<00:00:51.930> flash<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> iphone<00:00:55.430> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
use the fast flash on the iphone so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.099 
use the fast flash on the iphone so

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
there you see the document I'll turn on

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
there you see the document I'll turn on
the<00:00:58.350> flash<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> bottom<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.199> I'll

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the flash in the bottom right and I'll

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.520 
the flash in the bottom right and I'll
take<00:01:01.379> three<00:01:01.649> pictures<00:01:03.019> there's<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> first

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
take three pictures there's the first

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.990 
take three pictures there's the first
and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:07.340> important<00:01:08.340> focus<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and then the important focus the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.450 
and then the important focus the
document

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.040 

and<00:01:13.870> here<00:01:14.870> comes<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.260> last<00:01:15.409> one

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
and then as you can see it does a great

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.870 
and then as you can see it does a great
job<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:22.120> detecting<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.900> edges<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:24.550> takes

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
job of detecting the edges and it takes

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.930 
job of detecting the edges and it takes
all<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.260> shadows<00:01:26.260> out<00:01:26.680> of<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.580> makes<00:01:27.790> it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
all the shadows out of it and makes it

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.750 
all the shadows out of it and makes it
into<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.210> document<00:01:28.840> like<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.310> can<00:01:30.520> read
