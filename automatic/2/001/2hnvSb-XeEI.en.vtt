00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.040
 well my name is margot gold some of 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.200
 those who know me will be the one who has a 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.290
 past channel good na than the channel that 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.360
 it's called marco toro I will not upload videos anymore 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.760
 now if you live videos on this channel the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.039
 which is called margot del toro so 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.080
 was subscribed the last channel you can 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.940
 answer that you were to this one and 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.859
 Well, if not good how they have their week 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.270
 then be here and watch the video 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.330
 now let's start with the theme of the video 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.369
 which has as you will know recently 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.700
 time the area comes out an announcement and I 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.239
 which they said that the risk saga to 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.399
 finally come to his justice to his end 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.030
 later this month or early in 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.760
 following 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.620
 now 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.269
 what I think about what this saga has been 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.670
 this saga I feel caused more 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.379
 great of all wampis since apart from 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.010
 being very long has had many 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.409
 important events all in one 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.199
 same saga that we all know which one 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:04.070
 it's like the taste of 4 now technique 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.259
 it's gold all that true and you've left me 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 with the squares and a great room 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.200
 full of surprises and also with the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.420
 best characters I avoid see other 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.030
 sagas with very good characters that 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.310
 I do not know how nothing is enough for the pizza I lived 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.220
 they all remain characters you have left 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.679
 very well but in this saga the creation 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 of the characters in some example 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:32.170
 cavendish bartolomÃ© or viola all of them 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.660
 I want to be rich, everything is pressure, 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.550
 teach delighted quite delighted 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.830
 more than the characters of past sagas 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.650
 to emphasize that also characters in 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.220
 the past have been super cool but 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.190
 studies have filled more of me enchanted 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.530
 very much so a room is exceptional 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420
 it's been an exceptional saga I'm going to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.540
 I miss a lot but I also feel 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.260
 it 's time to move on to another saga 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.810
 I feel that it is time to evolve 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:04.300
 this room lasted quite a lot already have almost 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:07.630
 80 chapters this I think has already been 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.580
 a lot and today I'm anxious to see you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.000
 how will this saga end and also for 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.280
 see the beginning the new saga I feel 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.870
 that the beginning of the new saga al 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 just like this basis from the beginning I 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.350
 saga very very long because we start to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.810
 to enter or that I believe in the topic of 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.330
 ostiÃ³n as we begin to enter a 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.290
 little more 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.180
 light and you're about to beat the if you 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.670
 search or not I know if you look for more 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.010
 powerful so it 's about time that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.560
 goal with lotion com 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.630
 put obviously you are going to give a 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.510
 solution with less powerful but 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.090
 equally jon collision with and I with are 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.370
 monsters 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.879
 which I think also wins new 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.769
 science has fallen I do not think that abyss 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.890
 I do not think it's coming anymore 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.540
 and neither province returns from the end the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.580
 that we all certainly know about health 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.190
 party and everything 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.610
 and always be happy 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.920
 it will not be very strong very strong 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.180
 or cream and why three do it because not 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.010
 I think he defeats it then later in the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.350
 next saga I think it's going to be a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.720
 saga between introduction and another saga 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.030
 approach and probably I do 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.770
 largest and finally overcomes what 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 It is taking a long time because equally sir 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.340
 com inc and the eyes to the super super then 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.030
 is that you need a lot of preparation 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.280
 much strength and all that truth and nothing 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.520
 she is sitting super surprised without 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 words I look forward to what you are following 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.960
 one page has not disappointed me and never 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.130
 it will 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.900
 I think it's the only anime that 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.840
 even for a chapter has made me 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.780
 feel that something is missing nothing is everything 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.310
 I have loved all his ingenuity now 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 only one that I think I take off a post 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.780
 of one piece are the breaks because 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.500
 one is so cool that I want the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.690
 manga never rests and I want to see the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.610
 chapters every week but good 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.470
 I know it's impossible because now it's a 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.470
 human being and now have to rest 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.640
 the week but good fan dreams 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.799
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.950
 you copied that the saga from 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.250
 3rd is going to finish the van will miss 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.990
 to miss that is because although I though 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.450
 I liked the saga media super 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.460
 delighted also in some groups of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.530
 wanted I have seen that some has not 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.660
 liked the saga a lot and this 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.550
 they need a lot I do not understand why 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.590
 I feel that this saga has been super 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.720
 epic but good everyone has 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.940
 different opinions and the respects of 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.600
 opinions but would like to know why 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.170
 because they think so because you This one does 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.570

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.660
 final will miss you very much you're going 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.390
