these things are are pretty awesome
they're<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> lot<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> different<00:00:22.529> sounds

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
they're just a lot of different sounds

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
they're just a lot of different sounds
and<00:00:23.269> a<00:00:24.269> lot<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.810> different<00:00:25.230> channel

and a lot of different channel
combinations<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.880> get<00:00:27.029> every<00:00:27.539> tone<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.019> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
combinations to get every tone that you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.439 
combinations to get every tone that you
could<00:00:28.289> ever<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.189> car<00:00:29.429> tracks<00:00:29.789> I'm

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
could ever think of the car tracks I'm

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.569 
could ever think of the car tracks I'm
using<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> Boogie<00:00:31.289> mark<00:00:31.529> 5<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
using the Boogie mark 5 which is this

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.420 
using the Boogie mark 5 which is this
and<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.840> three<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
and there's three of them in there and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.510 
and there's three of them in there and
the<00:00:35.579> concept<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.270> trying<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.520> you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the concept is I'm trying to go for you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.639 
the concept is I'm trying to go for you
know<00:00:38.550> basically<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.750> good<00:00:39.930> rhythm<00:00:40.260> kind

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
know basically a really good rhythm kind

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.430 
know basically a really good rhythm kind
of<00:00:40.800> crunch<00:00:41.040> sound<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
of crunch sound and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
of crunch sound and
good<00:00:43.710> lead<00:00:44.070> sound<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.150> really<00:00:45.390> good<00:00:45.600> clean

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
good lead sound and really good clean

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.350 
good lead sound and really good clean
scent<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.650> variations<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
scent there's some variations of of the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.420 
scent there's some variations of of the
three<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:48.900> that's<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> basic<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.650> here<00:00:50.220> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
three but that's the basic thing here we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
three but that's the basic thing here we
using<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> compressor<00:00:51.930> gate<00:00:52.230> which<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
using the compressor gate which is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
using the compressor gate which is
really<00:00:53.430> cool<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.700> Jon's<00:00:54.150> pain<00:00:54.480> sound<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
really cool for Jon's pain sound it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.860 
really cool for Jon's pain sound it
squishes<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.830> down<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.400> good<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:57.480> sounds

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
squishes it down really good it sounds

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.970 
squishes it down really good it sounds
really<00:00:58.140> nice<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.160> z400<00:00:59.670> XL<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:00.980> compressive

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
really nice the z400 XL is a compressive

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.910 
really nice the z400 XL is a compressive
gait<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.519> actually<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:03.090> started<00:01:03.210> using

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
gait that I actually just started using

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.340 
gait that I actually just started using
I'm<00:01:04.920> new<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> TC<00:01:06.390> Electronics<00:01:07.020> world

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I'm new to the the TC Electronics world

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.950 
I'm new to the the TC Electronics world
of<00:01:07.560> compression<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.210> love<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of compression and I love it it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.770 
of compression and I love it it's
fantastic<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:11.160> all<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.000> pieces

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
fantastic like all of the other pieces

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
fantastic like all of the other pieces
that<00:01:13.080> I've<00:01:13.200> used<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.770> great<00:01:14.040> quality<00:01:14.250> sounds

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that I've used it's great quality sounds

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.290 
that I've used it's great quality sounds
great<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.950> thing<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
great the thing that I like about it is

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.719 
great the thing that I like about it is
that<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.690> tuned<00:01:18.930> appendix<00:01:19.440> side<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.100> one

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that it's tuned appendix side so one

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.570 
that it's tuned appendix side so one
side<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.899> gaining<00:01:22.289> basically<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
side I use for gaining basically for the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.650 
side I use for gaining basically for the
whole<00:01:23.729> rig<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.210> other<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.539> it<00:01:24.630> needs

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
whole rig and the other side it needs

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.969 
whole rig and the other side it needs
for<00:01:25.020> compression<00:01:26.570> which<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.770> really<00:01:28.770> just

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
for compression which is really just

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
for compression which is really just
something<00:01:29.160> clean<00:01:29.490> sound<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.050> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
something clean sound and I like the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.900 
something clean sound and I like the
fact<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> rotary<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
fact that it has a rotary we kind of

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.620 
fact that it has a rotary we kind of
select<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.390> instrument<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:35.210> you're<00:01:36.210> able<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
select the instrument and you're able to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.139 
select the instrument and you're able to
if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.850> that

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
if you if you want really good that

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.999 
if you if you want really good that
squash<00:01:39.570> compression<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.830> also

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
squash compression but you can also

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.029 
squash compression but you can also
bring<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.330> know<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.200> level<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.800> easily

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
bring out you know the level very easily

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.740 
bring out you know the level very easily
with<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> other<00:01:44.759> controls<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
with the other controls and that's the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
with the other controls and that's the
way<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:45.960> using<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:46.819> right<00:01:47.819> now<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
way I'm using it so right now on the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
way I'm using it so right now on the
clean<00:01:48.720> sound<00:01:48.959> it<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.950> makes<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.610> sort<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
clean sound it really makes the sort of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.529 
clean sound it really makes the sort of
arpeggiated<00:01:52.229> guitar<00:01:52.970> clean<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.479> I

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
arpeggiated guitar clean things that I

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.270 
arpeggiated guitar clean things that I
do<00:01:54.599> make<00:01:54.899> me<00:01:55.050> an<00:01:55.110> introduction<00:01:55.560> sits<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
do make me an introduction sits on to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.029 
do make me an introduction sits on to
makes<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.640> very<00:01:56.789> shiny<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:58.679> makes<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
makes it very shiny and it makes the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.949 
makes it very shiny and it makes the
guitar<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.520> lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> sustain<00:01:59.940> which<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
guitar I have a lot of sustain which I

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.949 
guitar I have a lot of sustain which I
really<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.380> health<00:02:01.619> reasons<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
really like health reasons and then of

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.790 
really like health reasons and then of
course<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.349> got<00:02:04.500> 3<00:02:04.890> m3<00:02:05.130> thousands<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.240> do

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
course we got 3 m3 thousands that do

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.180 
course we got 3 m3 thousands that do
various<00:02:07.800> combinations<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.640> reverbs<00:02:09.119> delays

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
various combinations of reverbs delays

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.500 
various combinations of reverbs delays
long<00:02:11.190> delays<00:02:11.580> short<00:02:12.030> delays<00:02:12.390> ping-pong

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
long delays short delays ping-pong

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630 
long delays short delays ping-pong
is<00:02:13.750> pretty<00:02:14.140> much<00:02:14.319> anything<00:02:14.560> John<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.220> think

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
is pretty much anything John can think

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.039 
is pretty much anything John can think
up<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.239> do<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:17.650> these<00:02:17.829> guys<00:02:19.049> three

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
up you can do do with these guys three

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.910 
up you can do do with these guys three
of<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:20.439> three<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.280> them<00:02:21.430> yeah<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.920> preset

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
of them three of them yeah so the preset

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.550 
of them three of them yeah so the preset
combination<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.790> unlimited<00:02:26.189> it's<00:02:27.299> awesome

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
combination is unlimited it's awesome

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.740 
combination is unlimited it's awesome
really<00:02:29.560> they<00:02:30.459> sound<00:02:30.760> amazing<00:02:30.940> they're<00:02:31.540> easy

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
really they sound amazing they're easy

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.699 
really they sound amazing they're easy
to<00:02:31.930> program<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:34.360> know<00:02:34.480> we'll<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.140> program

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
to program and you know we'll do program

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.530 
to program and you know we'll do program
changes<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> fly<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> show<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.329> John

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
changes on the fly in the show of John

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.599 
changes on the fly in the show of John
say<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> want<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.200> try<00:02:38.349> out<00:02:38.409> it<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.860> new<00:02:39.280> delay

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
say I want to try out it a new delay

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.910 
say I want to try out it a new delay
okay<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.359> just<00:02:40.540> get<00:02:40.989> an<00:02:41.079> error<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.379> program<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
okay and just get an error to program it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.610 
okay and just get an error to program it
up<00:02:42.010> real<00:02:42.190> quick<00:02:42.599> you're<00:02:43.599> all<00:02:43.720> set<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.079> go<00:02:44.230> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
up real quick you're all set to go and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.789 
up real quick you're all set to go and
3,000<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.640> piece<00:02:46.359> I've<00:02:46.569> been<00:02:46.720> using<00:02:46.900> for<00:02:47.049> many

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
3,000 is piece I've been using for many

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.110 
3,000 is piece I've been using for many
years<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.609> I<00:02:49.420> primarily<00:02:50.109> use<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
years and I primarily use it for the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.770 
years and I primarily use it for the
delays<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.530> obviously<00:02:54.159> it<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:55.269> does<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> lot

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
delays and obviously it it does a lot

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.309 
delays and obviously it it does a lot
more<00:02:55.840> than<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.650> lace<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:58.049> but<00:02:59.049> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
more than just the lace and but the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.649 
more than just the lace and but the
reason<00:02:59.620> why<00:02:59.769> what<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.609> really<00:03:00.909> like<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.329> because

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
reason why what I really like is because

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.629 
reason why what I really like is because
it<00:03:01.780> does<00:03:01.959> have<00:03:02.109> two<00:03:02.290> independent<00:03:02.650> engines<00:03:03.370> and

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
it does have two independent engines and

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.500 
it does have two independent engines and
so<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.930> one<00:03:05.109> unit<00:03:05.560> I'm<00:03:06.099> able<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.639> control<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
so the one unit I'm able to control the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.849 
so the one unit I'm able to control the
delay<00:03:09.599> time<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:10.629> feedback<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.560> everything

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
delay time and feedback and everything

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.949 
delay time and feedback and everything
on<00:03:12.159> one<00:03:12.430> side<00:03:12.510> independently<00:03:13.510> from<00:03:13.659> the<00:03:13.750> other

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
on one side independently from the other

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.839 
on one side independently from the other
side<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:15.040> something<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.370> I've<00:03:15.579> always

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
side and it's something that I've always

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.180 
side and it's something that I've always
done<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.900> studio<00:03:17.200> could<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:17.680> kind<00:03:17.919> of<00:03:18.010> like

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
done in a studio could get kind of like

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.030 
done in a studio could get kind of like
this<00:03:18.370> surrounding<00:03:19.150> delay<00:03:19.449> effect<00:03:19.919> either<00:03:20.919> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
this surrounding delay effect either I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.710 
this surrounding delay effect either I
do<00:03:21.160> with<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.639> ping<00:03:22.150> ponging

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
do with like a ping ponging

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.099 
do with like a ping ponging
delay<00:03:23.579> or<00:03:24.579> even<00:03:24.910> better<00:03:25.299> just<00:03:25.629> a<00:03:25.810> sailor

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
delay or even better just a sailor

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.670 
delay or even better just a sailor
delight<00:03:26.560> one<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:26.949> each<00:03:27.099> side

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
delight one on each side

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.190 
delight one on each side
and<00:03:28.769> just<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.819> know<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.030> sounds<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.750> clean

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
and just you know it sounds really clean

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.050 
and just you know it sounds really clean
and<00:03:31.980> beautiful<00:03:34.010> if<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.219> want<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.670> any<00:03:35.849> sort

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and beautiful if I want to do any sort

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.990 
and beautiful if I want to do any sort
of<00:03:36.150> role<00:03:36.359> also<00:03:36.689> whenever<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.140> have<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.319> control

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
of role also whenever I have the control

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.670 
of role also whenever I have the control
and<00:03:39.000> obviously<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.840> great<00:03:40.079> reverb<00:03:40.469> as

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and obviously it's a great reverb as

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.740 
and obviously it's a great reverb as
well<00:03:40.859> don't<00:03:41.099> use<00:03:41.280> as<00:03:41.459> many<00:03:41.640> reverbs<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.359> guitar

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
well don't use as many reverbs on guitar

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.129 
well don't use as many reverbs on guitar
but<00:03:42.989> when<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> do<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.459> sounds<00:03:44.879> unbelievable

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
but when I do it it sounds unbelievable

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.979 
but when I do it it sounds unbelievable
so<00:03:46.139> it's<00:03:46.769> probably<00:03:47.280> way<00:03:48.180> too<00:03:48.209> powerful<00:03:48.959> for

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so it's probably way too powerful for

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.679 
so it's probably way too powerful for
what<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.379> use<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.889> for<00:03:49.939> primarily<00:03:50.939> delays<00:03:51.450> but

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
what I use it for primarily delays but

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.119 
what I use it for primarily delays but
the<00:03:51.840> delay<00:03:52.049> sounds<00:03:52.469> so<00:03:52.650> rich<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.069> beautiful

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
the delay sounds so rich and beautiful

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.229 
the delay sounds so rich and beautiful
then<00:03:54.409> it's<00:03:55.409> my<00:03:55.590> choice<00:03:55.799> vertically<00:03:56.430> we<00:03:57.060> got

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
then it's my choice vertically we got

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.360 
then it's my choice vertically we got
the<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.810> twelve<00:03:58.109> ten<00:03:58.439> that<00:03:58.709> we<00:03:58.829> use<00:03:59.040> for

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
the the twelve ten that we use for

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.909 
the the twelve ten that we use for
chorusing<00:03:59.969> and<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.019> it's<00:04:01.379> not<00:04:01.650> an

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
chorusing and it just it's not an

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.039 
chorusing and it just it's not an
over-the-top<00:04:02.370> course<00:04:02.909> it's<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.239> nice<00:04:03.659> and

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
over-the-top course it's just nice and

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.520 
over-the-top course it's just nice and
wide<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:05.220> sounds<00:04:05.879> amazing<00:04:06.659> this<00:04:07.109> is<00:04:07.169> it

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
wide it really sounds amazing this is it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.190 
wide it really sounds amazing this is it
this<00:04:07.889> is<00:04:08.099> in<00:04:08.849> my<00:04:09.120> opinion<00:04:09.150> one<00:04:09.659> of<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> best

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
this is in my opinion one of the best

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.309 
this is in my opinion one of the best
units<00:04:10.590> ever<00:04:10.919> made<00:04:11.220> before<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.870> far<00:04:13.079> as<00:04:13.139> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
units ever made before so as far as the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.689 
units ever made before so as far as the
effects<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.579> don't<00:04:15.299> generally<00:04:15.989> do<00:04:16.889> really

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
effects I don't generally do really

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.150 
effects I don't generally do really
fancy<00:04:18.299> effects<00:04:18.870> about<00:04:19.139> looking<00:04:19.470> for<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.829> I'm

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
fancy effects about looking for that I'm

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.219 
fancy effects about looking for that I'm
looking<00:04:20.549> for<00:04:20.759> like<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> lush<00:04:21.209> forest<00:04:21.449> type<00:04:22.049> of

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
looking for like a lush forest type of

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.120 
looking for like a lush forest type of
sound<00:04:22.470> when<00:04:22.650> I'm<00:04:22.770> doing<00:04:23.250> clean<00:04:23.520> parts<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.949> I'm

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
sound when I'm doing clean parts and I'm

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.050 
sound when I'm doing clean parts and I'm
looking<00:04:26.460> for<00:04:27.169> delays<00:04:28.169> that<00:04:28.500> hurt<00:04:28.729> stereo<00:04:29.729> and

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
looking for delays that hurt stereo and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.240 
looking for delays that hurt stereo and
clean<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.720> kind<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.020> crying<00:04:31.320> some<00:04:31.650> air<00:04:31.889> around

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
clean and kind of crying some air around

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.870 
clean and kind of crying some air around
on<00:04:32.789> playing<00:04:33.090> solos<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:34.669> compression<00:04:35.669> on<00:04:35.849> the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
on playing solos and compression on the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.580 
on playing solos and compression on the
clean<00:04:36.180> sound<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.690> getting<00:04:37.110> from<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.380> TC

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
clean sound and getting from the TC

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.790 
clean sound and getting from the TC
compressor<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:40.320> know<00:04:40.380> if<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:40.530> look<00:04:40.680> at

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
compressor so you know if you look at

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.390 
compressor so you know if you look at
the<00:04:40.889> rack<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.070> might<00:04:41.340> look<00:04:41.580> being<00:04:41.880> complicated

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
the rack I might look being complicated

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.580 
the rack I might look being complicated
you<00:04:44.400> know<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:44.760> conceptually<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:45.780> it's<00:04:46.229> very

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
you know but conceptually it's it's very

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.770 
you know but conceptually it's it's very
straight<00:04:47.190> ahead<00:04:47.310> as<00:04:47.699> far<00:04:47.880> as<00:04:47.940> one<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.360> them<00:04:48.449> I'm

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
straight ahead as far as one of them I'm

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.330 
straight ahead as far as one of them I'm
trying<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.169> do<00:04:49.289> with<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.830> know<00:04:50.039> got<00:04:50.310> some

one's great about that pedal all the TC

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.940 
one's great about that pedal all the TC
gear<00:05:31.120> is<00:05:31.360> all<00:05:33.030> run<00:05:34.320> after<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.410> preamp<00:05:35.740> section

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
gear is all run after the preamp section

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.190 
gear is all run after the preamp section
of<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.280> amps<00:05:36.670> so<00:05:36.760> it's<00:05:36.970> all<00:05:37.150> returned<00:05:37.570> stereo

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
of the amps so it's all returned stereo

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.240 
of the amps so it's all returned stereo
into<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.650> mixer<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:39.540> John<00:05:40.540> has<00:05:40.840> a<00:05:40.870> stereo<00:05:41.680> setup

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
into a mixer and John has a stereo setup

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.770 
into a mixer and John has a stereo setup
so<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:42.670> have<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.790> left<00:05:43.030> cabinet<00:05:43.510> or<00:05:43.630> right

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
so we have a left cabinet or right

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.900 
so we have a left cabinet or right
cabinet<00:05:44.260> that<00:05:44.350> are<00:05:44.470> miked<00:05:44.680> up<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.250> that's

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
cabinet that are miked up and that's

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.390 
cabinet that are miked up and that's
that's<00:05:46.480> what<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.810> hear<00:05:47.020> in<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.170> PA<00:05:47.350> so<00:05:48.220> there
