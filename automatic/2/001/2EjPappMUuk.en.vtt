what it hit and initially when we went
with<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.310> setup<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.850> were<00:01:32.970> questioning

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
with this setup we were questioning

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.730 
with this setup we were questioning
whether<00:01:33.450> or<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> car<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.350> even<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
whether or not the car was even going to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
whether or not the car was even going to
be<00:01:34.829> capable<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> Elevens<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:36.090> ended<00:01:36.360> up

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
be capable of Elevens we ended up

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
side for years now and we're constantly

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.589 
side for years now and we're constantly
just<00:02:52.519> trying<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.819> keep<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.180> each<00:02:53.390> other

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
just trying to keep up with each other

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.479 
just trying to keep up with each other
he<00:02:53.900> does<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.590> higher<00:02:54.769> horsepower<00:02:55.010> car

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
he does have the higher horsepower car

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.250 
he does have the higher horsepower car
but<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> do<00:02:55.819> have<00:02:56.060> more<00:02:56.329> experience<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.079> car

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
but I do have more experience in the car

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.199 
but I do have more experience in the car
driving<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.829> down<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:57.980> track<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:58.549> when<00:02:59.120> it

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
driving it down the track so when it

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.900 
driving it down the track so when it
came<00:02:59.329> down<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.900> just<00:02:59.930> driver<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.700> think

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
came down to is just driver and I think

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.960 
came down to is just driver and I think
it<00:03:02.000> was<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> good<00:03:02.299> end<00:03:02.450> result<00:03:03.040> at<00:03:04.040> 30<00:03:04.370> psi<00:03:04.579> of

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
it was a good end result at 30 psi of

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.640 
it was a good end result at 30 psi of
