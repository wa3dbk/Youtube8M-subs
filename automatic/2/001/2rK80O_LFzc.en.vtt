00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 powerful apa guys here or not 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:21.210
 power for boys can present the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.970
 pussy I do not want to say goodbye is welding 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.840
 20 meters is mentally greeting you 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.360
 however, today I do not present this to you 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 new video that mount squad bild era 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.160
 from a delay of time they did not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.200
 a team in fact boer from December 24th 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.329
 if I am not mistaken and therefore I have said but if i 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.309
 guys and since we don't do it from 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.260
 taranto 1 oct gentlemen try one a 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 particular as it will be a scooter 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.900
 that but it wo n't cost is absolutely so 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.810
 indeed with 30 40 thousand all this is done 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.240
 team and it's really not cover is 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.880
 obviously very strong though 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.220
 particularity is the one excused but it is 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.050
 that of having players that only a few 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.739
 they use and so you this thing 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 I like it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.009
 first of all on the facebook page vi 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.259
 I asked while I show you 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.060
 the goalkeeper who is begovic had asked 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.159
 that I give you what you wanted to see 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 how many of you have told me to do the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.799
 portable over country of stanford ball bat 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.109
 i was speaking powerful english but it is not 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.689
 but decided to upload it either tomorrow or 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.219
 the day after tomorrow because tomorrow if I do not 5 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.139
 he will release a few exits to the shovel 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.329
 two players are still decided 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.280
 I will buy them once this is loaded 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 video because maybe i look at the last i 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.459
 your comments so I will decide exactly 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.799
 better players 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.889
 so don't hesitate to comment with two 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.359
 players that seem to you a 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:44.249
 player that costs you enough 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.899
 a player who is very strong 

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.700
 it costs maybe less it seems a lot more 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.319
 paid anyway we leave immediately then 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.299
 central defender central defender 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.090
 the module you've obviously already seen is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.279
 a 3 5 2 central defender use 0 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.540
 of the arsenal is Swiss has already changed 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:02.330
 team and play if I'm not wrong in the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.620
 in ix to 96 I am not sure however it is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.440
 the bundesliga has passed 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.060
 then I swear to you is another defender who 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.250
 I found out to be pretty wandered 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.770
 with david lewis kabul in fact at 75 of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.020
 city â€‹â€‹76 shot of little room header 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.560
 head and 76 defense then very much 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.990
 strong we assigned not yet floor 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 and then then another one is enough 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.160
 central defender is bomber gen yes 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 call like that 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.420
 I paid for von bergen von bergen 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.330
 only 300 credits play in Palermo 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.120
 it is also Swiss and at 72 speed 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.590
 76 defense 75 header 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.209
 as I had already said favorite 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.800
 maybe use non-rare players who 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.930
 they are rather more paid, above all 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.860
 defenders however I wish is still strong 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.420
 as well as kabul 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.070
 the other central defender as at 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.620
 we usually have david luiz david lewis co 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.620
 paid three thousand and seven hundred and they love 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.060
 stand 78 88 and header 87 of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.739
 defense and david lewis there is not much to 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.390
 say I made a lot of videos about him 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.530
 and in any case if you have not yet seen 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.230
 looking at you I tell you only what it is 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.750
 highly paid with an external shovel 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.420
 left oil use and now it seems to you 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.970
 normal mike barclays but it's not like that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.000
 roughly so here I have chosen the game 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.350
 in the queens park ranger in qpr out of seven 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.810
 matches made me two goals 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.150
 not many though in 3 5 2 I don't know if you have 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.450
 never noticed the exteriors are very useful 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.830
 do the cross not to make goal notes 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.260
 because the two of them think about it 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.299
 attacking midfielder and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.410
 so anyway I have to say that it is me 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.269
 very much pleased 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.310
 a scary acceleration now don't me 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.180
 but I remember 91 of speed and eighty of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.719
 dribbling then ok, header is 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.209
 and a superficial header 68 and 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.560
 so you guys so then outside 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.019
 right external right one of mine 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.609
 favorite players that shaqiri shaqiri 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.629
 and plays in the bundesliga in the bayern elba 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.180
 in the bayern monaco and the speed of 87 a 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.810
 I only paid for skill 86 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.700
 700 also he made two goals and me 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.540
 really like it a lot I don't know why though 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.430
 aspires to shovel so here then boh passes 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.280
 in the other meeting a great defensive track 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.079
 I decided to use is inler in shape 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.879
 and the air in the form either play it 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.549
 in the series a for this it doubles 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.440
 in agreement with now I remember von bergen 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.209
 and will make agreement is normal with and shaqiri 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.669
 with the same thing he will do it with usero 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.199
 then there is something to say about hiller in form 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.090
 one thing then inler is a player 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.680
 good enough now I'll show you 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.310
 immediately how much I paid we see a 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.440
 moment 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.169
 i paid it 18 milan hasn't done it yet 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.180
 goals but then I haven't got boys yet 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.639
 used very well because I don't know if 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.190
 fear but fit players must 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.970
 discover the peculiarities however of hiller 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.020
 at 94 in the power of the shot and it is 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.849
 really a lot and in long distance shots a 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.880
 91 in WHO 8 to 91 instead of in steps 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.599
 87 and so it seems to me a no I was wrong 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.220
 god barefoot god of felt pen and therefore mi 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.330
 it seems strong enough we pass immediately 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220
 at the other the defensive midfielder 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.840
 central that artet arteta plays 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.370
 in the arsenal it is not the best 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.720
 defensive midfielder just not 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.940
 I had more money and being this 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.590
 the political account of the paddle indeed 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.300
 this team sells between a 3 or 4 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.250
 episodes maybe I'll do an episode now 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.930
 where I will talk about a series of things like that 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.970
 which summarize everything as a midfielder 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.490
 central offensive my best is the 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.590
 my favorite tarab player he has 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.630
 done in 7 games and 3 goals 5 stars 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.580
 skill 5 steep stakes weak 81 speed and 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.259
 85 of dribbling pass immediately 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.610
 the attack on the CT here is the worst 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.710
 wandering I never showed it 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.449
 guys this is called yes if not 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.380
 guys it 's really cool I paid it 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.870
 only one thousand and one beast at 85 in the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.740
 shooting speed 76 and flanked by 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.780
 also a highly paid band player 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.729
 power and speed 79 of Czech shooting yes 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.720
 they make scary guys in seven 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.669
 matches five goals 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.800
 therefore it exists in seven games and 9 goals 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.130
