 cream cheese 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.390
 icesave 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.880
 the first thing we're going to do this preparation is cooking our 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.760
 pumpkins around 200 degrees 220 degrees otavalo 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.090

 we have applied them 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.830
 in julienne and washing 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.310
 We were going to carrió or give it in this case the pumpkin can be boiled but at 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.340
 being boiled comes out too much or 80 and loses its flavor 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.710
 what suits you whenever that room 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.660
 the latter can do it the day before have left in the refrigerator 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.830
 and then we are going to remove the conasupo from a spoon in this way and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.900
 We will process to liquefy the ua process them with vegetable broth 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.090
 this soup in addition to being too practical very tasty 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.079

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 Santiago 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.149

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.859
 five minutes for the flavors to be wasted 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.300
 let's pay
