00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
time you literally came up with the

time you literally came up with the
entire<00:02:05.590> mythology<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.520> chronology<00:02:06.850> from

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479

1982<00:02:08.349> all<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.739> way<00:02:08.830> through<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.159> tooth<00:02:09.459> out

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
1982 all the way through to tooth out

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.830 
1982 all the way through to tooth out
10<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:10.850> we<00:02:10.970> looked<00:02:11.180> at<00:02:11.330> where<00:02:11.569> did<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
10 and then we looked at where did the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.559 
10 and then we looked at where did the
story<00:02:12.230> points<00:02:12.740> cook<00:02:13.190> from<00:02:13.370> 82<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.150> our<00:02:14.300> game

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
story points cook from 82 to our game

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.420 
story points cook from 82 to our game
and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.170> from<00:02:15.290> our<00:02:15.470> gaming<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:16.010> Tron<00:02:16.250> Legacy

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and then from our gaming to Tron Legacy

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.370 
and then from our gaming to Tron Legacy
so<00:02:16.850> everything<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.569> do<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> game

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
so everything that you do in the game

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
so everything that you do in the game
has<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.069> meaning<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.730> purpose<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.270> when<00:02:20.569> you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
has a meaning and a purpose for when you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:31.210 
has a meaning and a purpose for when you
actually<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> film

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.280
