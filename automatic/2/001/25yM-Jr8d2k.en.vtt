00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the first step is to heat two

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.860 
the first step is to heat two
tablespoons<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.010> olive<00:00:38.309> oil<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.360> pan<00:00:39.570> and

tablespoons of olive oil in a pan and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.889 
tablespoons of olive oil in a pan and
just<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> hot<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.719> going

just get that hot and to that I'm going

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.069 
just get that hot and to that I'm going
to<00:00:43.020> add<00:00:43.200> 3/4<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.010> cup<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.520> chopped<00:00:45.120> onion<00:00:45.510> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
a really nice different flavor to this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
a really nice different flavor to this
because<00:01:36.930> they're<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.259> more<00:01:37.500> meaty<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
because they're a little more meaty and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.270 
because they're a little more meaty and
texture<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> button<00:01:39.869> mushrooms<00:01:40.350> they

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
texture than the button mushrooms they

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.899 
texture than the button mushrooms they
also<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.869> meaty<00:01:43.770> flavor<00:01:44.100> woodsy

also have more of a meaty flavor woodsy
flavor<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.619> helps<00:01:46.950> with

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
flavor to them so that really helps with

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.399 
flavor to them so that really helps with
the<00:01:47.250> flavor<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> pilaf<00:01:48.180> too<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:49.290> you're
