00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
one thing they did here before the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.020 
one thing they did here before the
switch<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:53.190> had<00:00:55.070> this<00:00:56.070> knob<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.430> was<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
switch they had this knob here was a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.619 
switch they had this knob here was a
tone<00:00:57.360> control<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.219> it<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.430> only<00:00:59.629> operational

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
tone control and it was only operational

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.479 
tone control and it was only operational
when<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.989> had<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> toggle<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> up

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
when you had the toggle in the up

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.539 
when you had the toggle in the up
position<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.329> activate<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.549> active

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
position to activate the active

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.030 
position to activate the active
electronics<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.140> position<00:01:07.350> all

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
electronics and the down position all

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.789 
electronics and the down position all
the<00:01:08.070> pickups<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.700> passive<00:01:09.470> what<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.590> did

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the pickups are passive what they did

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
the pickups are passive what they did
now<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.460> made<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.820> toggle<00:01:12.720> switch<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
now is they made this toggle switch a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590 
now is they made this toggle switch a
kill<00:01:13.350> switch<00:01:13.560> which<00:01:14.549> knocks<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> sound

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
kill switch which knocks all the sound

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
kill switch which knocks all the sound
off<00:01:15.780> completely<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.650> don't<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.310> handy

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
off completely I don't know how handy

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.780 
off completely I don't know how handy
that's<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.320> but<00:01:19.320> now<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.890> tone<00:01:20.759> knob

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that's going to be but now the tone knob

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.170 
that's going to be but now the tone knob
works<00:01:21.390> 24<00:01:22.380> 7<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.460> i'll<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:24.000> using

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
works 24 7 so i'll probably be using

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.740 
works 24 7 so i'll probably be using
some<00:01:24.540> 9-volt<00:01:25.080> batteries<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.540> but<00:01:27.540> i

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
because that's going to get in the wave

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
because that's going to get in the wave

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
sound the effect of this knob basically

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.970 
sound the effect of this knob basically
is

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.940 

dialing<00:02:24.980> whatever<00:02:25.280> kind<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.550> tone<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.910> want

now<00:03:06.890> we<00:03:06.950> move<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.340> up<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> neck<00:03:08.420> position

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
now we move on up to the neck position

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.140 
now we move on up to the neck position
g-forces<00:03:10.070> that's<00:03:10.370> where<00:03:10.580> you<00:03:10.670> get<00:03:10.790> your<00:03:10.940> real
