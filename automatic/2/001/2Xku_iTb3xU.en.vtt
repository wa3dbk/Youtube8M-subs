00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.629
 Consider standing for shooting 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.179
 by moving targets which with success 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.360
 can also be used when shooting at 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.490
 fixed targets at the same time 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.789
 providing quick arrow care from the line 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 aiming the enemy 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.300
 standing for shooting 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.180
 moving targets must satisfy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.519
 basic requirement to provide 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 short-term smooth wiring 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.439
 horizontal rifles in any 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.180
 directions 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 when ready for shooting standing on 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.469
 moving targets need to aim for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.230
 so that the moving friend is relatively 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.260
 other body parts were not very tough 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 fixed joints for power 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 corresponding body flexibility a 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.690
 hence also to ensure 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.180
 smooth rotational motion 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 torso 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.430
 need to try to keep it straight with 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.449
 smallest movement in the side and bend in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.820
 back when straightened 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.900
 will be rigidly fixed in the lower back or 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.700
 hip joints straightened 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.100
 torso center of gravity rifle 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.220
 located at a considerable distance from 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 vertical center of gravity of the body therefore 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 compliance body equilibrium conditions 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 arrow with a rifle or rifle 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.270
 requires primarily an increase in the area 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.100
 supports this is all the more necessary systems 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.439
 what the arrow has to do when 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.220
 goals to quickly roll up weapons and 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.890
 when laying 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.250
 My starting position at the ready 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 shooting is the most stable and comfortable 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.799
 fabrication at which stop and create 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 support squares in the form of a trapezoid 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.329
 distance between the feet and equal to or 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 more than the width of the shoulders while the left foot 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.979
 feet should be to the left of the plane 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.110
 shooting ostap right leg crossed 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.430
 about the middle of the plane 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.860
 or one third closer to the heel 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.960
 left hand support automat or 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 sniper rifle should be bent 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.750
 at the elbow so that the shoulder and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.879
 forearm have formed a blunt angle of the bow and 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.920
 It should be given to the more forward 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.030
 be far to the left of the plane 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.800
 firing 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.299
 left hand should not be very 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.040
 tightly cover the handguard 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.310
 or barrel sniper lining 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.690
 rifles with all your fingers 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.909
 left hand must do the work 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 mainly to hold weapons in 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.150
 horizontal position but with it 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.620
 and slightly press the weapon to the shoulder 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.200
 the head should be kept so that 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.500
 Borschik tightly pressed to the ridge 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.260
 The butt position of the head should be 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.629
 opportunities naturally application should 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.760
 be tight for this right hand with 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.819
 effort to rest the butt in the area 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.709
 nomadic notch retention automata in 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.450
 horizontal position should 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.549
 produced mostly right 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.349
 hand cheek tightly pressed comb 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.790

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.739
 right hand to hold the floor 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.349
 omitted so that it is 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.890
 relation to the body at an angle of 30 50 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.890
