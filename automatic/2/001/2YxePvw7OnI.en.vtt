know<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> use<00:02:00.030> them

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
know you really don't want to use them

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.380 
know you really don't want to use them
because

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
because

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.090 
because
you<00:02:01.540> might<00:02:01.690> kill<00:02:02.080> yourself<00:02:02.530> with<00:02:02.650> them<00:02:02.800> first

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you might kill yourself with them first

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.990 
you might kill yourself with them first
of<00:02:03.340> all<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:05.500> might<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.890> do<00:02:06.220> anything<00:02:06.460> even

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
of all and it might not do anything even

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820 
of all and it might not do anything even
in<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.300> higher<00:02:07.510> around<00:02:07.810> like<00:02:07.990> 30<00:02:08.319> plus<00:02:08.649> I

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
in the higher around like 30 plus I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.290 
in the higher around like 30 plus I
don't<00:02:08.890> think<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> new<00:02:09.459> tubes<00:02:09.819> are<00:02:10.000> really

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
don't think the new tubes are really

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.210 
don't think the new tubes are really
gonna<00:02:10.390> do<00:02:10.630> anything<00:02:10.869> now<00:02:11.200> where<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> new

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
gonna do anything now where the new

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.070 
gonna do anything now where the new
tubes<00:02:12.670> come<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.810> handy<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:15.150> when<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.630> an

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
tubes come in handy is when you have an

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.030 
tubes come in handy is when you have an
insta-kill

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
insta-kill

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.910 
insta-kill
and<00:02:18.270> that's<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.630> reason<00:02:19.990> why<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.200> had<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.620> put

and that's the reason why I had to put

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.560 
and that's the reason why I had to put
it<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.400> lesson<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> number<00:02:22.330> four

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
it on this lesson in the number four

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.910 
it on this lesson in the number four
spot<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.050> because<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.570> crazy<00:02:25.920> effective

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
spot is because it is crazy effective

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240 
spot is because it is crazy effective
with<00:02:27.250> insta-kill<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.360> will<00:02:28.660> kill

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
with insta-kill like you will kill

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.770

just having a sniper rifle with the iron
sights<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.520> always<00:04:34.150> thought<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.360> would<00:04:34.539> be

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
sights I always thought that would be

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.719 
sights I always thought that would be
awesome<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.259> he<00:04:35.380> finally<00:04:35.919> got<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.430> black

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
awesome and he finally got it in black

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.760 
awesome and he finally got it in black

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
you're really good weapon and being able

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.040 
you're really good weapon and being able
to<00:04:44.740> take<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.009> scope<00:04:45.370> off<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.910> really<00:04:46.840> awesome

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
to take the scope off is really awesome

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.469 
to take the scope off is really awesome
it<00:04:47.560> looks<00:04:47.860> cool<00:04:48.220> it's<00:04:48.610> very<00:04:49.060> fun<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:50.110> and

it looks cool it's very fun to use and
it's<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.660> lot<00:04:52.900> better<00:04:53.349> than<00:04:53.500> having<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.160> skull

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
it's a lot better than having the skull

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.490 
it's a lot better than having the skull
because<00:04:54.639> it<00:04:54.940> doesn't<00:04:55.210> block<00:04:55.539> everything<00:04:56.139> out

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
because it doesn't block everything out
