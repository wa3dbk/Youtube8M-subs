here with my four ply yarn and I found

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
here with my four ply yarn and I found
that<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.870> was<00:00:13.019> kind<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.380> thick<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> did

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
that it was kind of thick so what I did

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.960 
that it was kind of thick so what I did
was<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.660> took<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.680> four<00:00:17.100> ply<00:00:17.369> yarn<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
was I just took my four ply yarn and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.760 
was I just took my four ply yarn and
took<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> apart<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.660> turned<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> into<00:00:19.109> two<00:00:19.500> ply

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.580 
took it apart and turned it into two ply
yarn<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.480> that's<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.050> working<00:00:22.470> with

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.140 

and<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.680> I've<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:25.830> attached<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.880> over

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
