the capabilities of doing what we can do
as<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:32.949> race<00:04:33.310> what<00:04:33.789> are<00:04:33.879> the<00:04:33.940> only<00:04:34.120> ones<00:04:35.129> they

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
as a race what are the only ones they

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.850 
as a race what are the only ones they
actually<00:04:36.699> consider<00:04:37.210> every<00:04:37.870> single<00:04:38.259> one<00:04:38.409> of<00:04:38.470> us

actually consider every single one of us

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.999 
actually consider every single one of us
loyalty<00:04:41.099> now<00:04:42.099> think<00:04:43.060> about<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.330> yes<00:04:44.009> all

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
loyalty now think about that yes all

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.860 
loyalty now think about that yes all
beings<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:46.240> would<00:04:46.840> try<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:48.210> be<00:04:49.210> spiritual

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
beings that would try and be spiritual

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.570 
beings that would try and be spiritual
and<00:04:49.990> raise<00:04:50.199> their<00:04:50.379> spirituality<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.430> in

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
and raise their spirituality and in

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.710 
and raise their spirituality and in
essence<00:04:52.180> would<00:04:52.300> be<00:04:52.360> royalty<00:04:54.000> yes<00:04:55.000> I<00:04:55.240> suppose

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
essence would be royalty yes I suppose

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.139 
essence would be royalty yes I suppose
that's<00:04:55.990> true
