00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
one's going to be a longer one so we're

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.039 
one's going to be a longer one so we're
gonna<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.200> another<00:01:37.320> double<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.070> bands

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049

another<00:01:44.970> double<00:01:45.420> gray<00:01:45.570> bands<00:01:46.909> inside<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.149> two

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
another double gray bands inside the two

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.899 
another double gray bands inside the two
linked<00:01:48.799> two<00:01:49.799> links<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.399> already<00:01:50.520> there

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
linked two links that are already there

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
linked two links that are already there
on<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.409> bring<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.799> onto

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
on to there and then bring it back onto

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
on to there and then bring it back onto
your<00:01:53.280> hook

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.100 

so<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.100> move<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> thick<00:02:00.390> part<00:02:00.690> of<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.960> hook

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
so now move that thick part of your hook

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.290 
so now move that thick part of your hook
to<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:02.190> now<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.370> have<00:02:02.550> one<00:02:02.580> that's<00:02:02.880> only<00:02:03.030> one

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
to so now you have one that's only one

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.420 
to so now you have one that's only one
link<00:02:03.510> long<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.410> three<00:02:05.040> lengths

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
link long and one that's three lengths

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.190 
link long and one that's three lengths
long<00:02:07.580> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.240> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> make<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.720> longer<00:02:09.930> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
long if you want to make that longer you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100 
long if you want to make that longer you
can<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> guess<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.790> another<00:02:11.960> twist<00:02:12.960> it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
can I guess and then do another twist it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.630 
can I guess and then do another twist it
around<00:02:13.200> two<00:02:13.500> times<00:02:13.770> which<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.160> create<00:02:14.370> three

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
around two times which will create three

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.120

going to bring those to the double band

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.830 
going to bring those to the double band
link<00:04:27.370> through<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.060> bring<00:04:28.360> it<00:04:28.390> back<00:04:28.630> on

your hook

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.730 
your hook
mine<00:04:30.520> looks<00:04:30.730> very<00:04:30.940> twisted<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:32.350> you're

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
mine looks very twisted and then you're

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.220 
mine looks very twisted and then you're
gonna<00:04:32.860> make<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.250> slipknot<00:04:33.700> by<00:04:34.360> taking<00:04:34.900> the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
gonna make it slipknot by taking the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.740 
gonna make it slipknot by taking the
single<00:04:35.530> bin<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.610> part<00:04:36.880> that's<00:04:37.060> closer<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.630> you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
single bin the part that's closer to you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.560 
single bin the part that's closer to you
and<00:04:37.930> bringing<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.980> around<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:40.120> part<00:04:40.390> that's

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
and bringing it around the part that's

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.810 
and bringing it around the part that's
further<00:04:40.840> away<00:04:41.080> from<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.680> then<00:04:42.370> pull<00:04:42.640> on

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
further away from you and then pull on

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.650 
further away from you and then pull on
it<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.240> make<00:04:43.660> this<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.730> that's<00:04:45.880> pretty<00:04:46.240> much<00:04:46.330> it

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
it to make this so that's pretty much it

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.980 
it to make this so that's pretty much it
except<00:04:47.110> for<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:48.040> we<00:04:48.160> have<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.370> add<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
except for that we have to add the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.420 
except for that we have to add the
silver<00:04:49.990> band<00:04:50.200> so<00:04:50.740> we're<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.010> going<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.190> take

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
silver band so we're just going to take

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.640 
silver band so we're just going to take
a<00:04:51.460> silver<00:04:51.970> band<00:04:52.330> or<00:04:52.630> any<00:04:52.840> other<00:04:53.020> color<00:04:53.350> band

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
a silver band or any other color band

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:01.640 
a silver band or any other color band
and<00:04:53.920> then<00:04:54.850> twist<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.390> around<00:04:57.060> once<00:04:59.070> on<00:05:00.070> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
and then twist it around once on the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.430 
and then twist it around once on the
like<00:05:02.650> handle<00:05:03.550> section<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.050> just<00:05:05.260> think

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
