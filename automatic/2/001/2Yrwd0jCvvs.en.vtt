there were going to be issues such as

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.100 
there were going to be issues such as
different<00:02:04.560> screen<00:02:05.460> sizes<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> therefore

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
different screen sizes and therefore

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.830 
different screen sizes and therefore
that<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.429> some<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that is going to have to be some of the

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.360 
that is going to have to be some of the
optimization<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.830> serious<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
optimization for the more serious the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940 
optimization for the more serious the
more<00:02:11.700> larger<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.140> glass

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
more larger the more glass

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.949 
more larger the more glass
orientated<00:02:14.670> applications<00:02:15.330> there's<00:02:15.599> no<00:02:15.750> one

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
orientated applications there's no one

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.770 
orientated applications there's no one
is<00:02:16.530> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.099> able<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.700> example

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
is going to be able to for example

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.030 
is going to be able to for example
create<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> title<00:02:19.170> that's<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:19.950> able

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
create a title that's going to be able

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.949 
create a title that's going to be able
to<00:02:20.160> say<00:02:20.340> play<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> game<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.209> well<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.750> oh

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to say play a game as well on the oh

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.520 
to say play a game as well on the oh
let's<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.150> Xbox<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.140> on

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
let's go with Xbox one is what it can on

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.369 
let's go with Xbox one is what it can on
a<00:02:25.769> phone<00:02:26.160> or<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.580> PC<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.420> other<00:02:27.540> words<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:28.050> course

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
a phone or a PC in other words of course

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.350 
a phone or a PC in other words of course
that's<00:02:29.129> just<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.790> happen<00:02:29.849> but<00:02:30.180> for

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
that's just not going to happen but for

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.059 
that's just not going to happen but for
smaller<00:02:30.599> applications<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.470> does<00:02:31.650> make<00:02:31.860> sense

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
smaller applications it does make sense

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.400 
smaller applications it does make sense
to<00:02:32.340> start<00:02:32.819> unifying<00:02:33.630> these<00:02:33.870> development

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
to start unifying these development

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.470 
to start unifying these development
platforms<00:02:34.980> because<00:02:35.160> obviously<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.849> lot<00:02:36.360> of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
platforms because obviously a lot of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.350 
platforms because obviously a lot of
them<00:02:36.599> are<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:37.040> utilizing<00:02:38.040> very<00:02:38.880> similar

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
them are really utilizing very similar

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
could do this of course it does help to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.289 
could do this of course it does help to
encourage<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.280> developers<00:02:47.790> onto<00:02:48.150> their

Apple's own dominance as well Microsoft
have<00:03:13.049> not<00:03:13.230> really<00:03:13.590> been<00:03:13.620> able<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.190> forge<00:03:14.489> their

have not really been able to forge their

have not really been able to forge their
way<00:03:14.910> into<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.209> market<00:03:15.569> as<00:03:15.660> may<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.840> as<00:03:16.049> they

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
way into the market as may be as they

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.470 
way into the market as may be as they
expected<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:17.280> despite<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> fact<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
expected and despite the fact the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.789 
expected and despite the fact the
windows<00:03:18.780> phones<00:03:19.019> do<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.470> some<00:03:19.680> nice

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
windows phones do have some nice

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.309 
windows phones do have some nice
features<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.660> quite<00:03:21.900> there<00:03:22.019> yet

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
features it's just not quite there yet

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.009 
features it's just not quite there yet
so<00:03:22.709> obviously<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.489> acquisition<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
so obviously with the acquisition of a

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.710 
so obviously with the acquisition of a
would<00:03:25.769> establish<00:03:26.280> manufacturers<00:03:27.269> such<00:03:27.389> as<00:03:27.450> no

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
would establish manufacturers such as no

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.289 
would establish manufacturers such as no
quiere<00:03:28.079> will<00:03:28.410> help<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.579> they<00:03:29.760> still<00:03:30.000> have

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
quiere will help but they still have

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.930 
quiere will help but they still have
some<00:03:30.720> way<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.230> especially<00:03:32.190> with<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.700> cloud

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
some way to go especially with the cloud

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.020 
some way to go especially with the cloud
type<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.690> API<00:03:34.079> for<00:03:34.950> example<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.700> recent

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
type of API for example the recent

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.170 
type of API for example the recent
office<00:03:36.299> 365<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.019> just<00:03:37.769> an<00:03:37.889> example<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.700> how

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
office 365 is just an example of how

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.940 
office 365 is just an example of how
they<00:03:39.359> are<00:03:39.420> starting<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.840> push<00:03:40.170> their<00:03:40.440> services

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
they are starting to push their services

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.640 
they are starting to push their services
towards<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.730> cloud-based<00:03:42.139> distribution<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
towards a cloud-based distribution the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.650 
towards a cloud-based distribution the
theory<00:03:43.920> behind<00:03:44.130> all<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.120> someone<00:03:45.420> who

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
theory behind all this is someone who

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.020 
theory behind all this is someone who
uses<00:03:46.260> windows<00:03:46.560> deserve<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.519> can

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
uses windows deserve is that you can

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.420 
uses windows deserve is that you can
actually<00:03:48.180> very<00:03:48.569> easily<00:03:48.950> develop<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.310> deploy

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
actually very easily develop and deploy

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.319 
actually very easily develop and deploy
an<00:03:50.940> application<00:03:51.049> into<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.319> cell<00:03:53.069> phone<00:03:53.400> but

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
an application into a cell phone but

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.150 
an application into a cell phone but
what<00:03:54.810> they<00:03:54.959> are<00:03:55.109> really<00:03:55.260> hoping<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.769> course<00:03:55.799> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
what they are really hoping of course is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.789 
what they are really hoping of course is
to<00:03:56.280> maybe<00:03:56.579> create<00:03:57.299> lightweight<00:03:57.989> applications

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
to maybe create lightweight applications

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.879

does make an awful lot of sense on PCs
it<00:04:11.639> doesn't<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.709> matter<00:04:13.709> quite<00:04:14.040> as<00:04:14.220> much

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
just doing whatever it can also help for

a<00:04:45.650> lot<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.400> will<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:46.730> to<00:04:46.760> be<00:04:46.910> pushed

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
a lot of that will have to be pushed

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.630 
a lot of that will have to be pushed
towards<00:04:47.570> gaming<00:04:47.990> so<00:04:48.140> it's<00:04:48.260> going<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.410> be<00:04:48.500> very

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
towards gaming so it's going to be very

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.680 
towards gaming so it's going to be very
interesting<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.790> see<00:04:49.970> just<00:04:50.000> how<00:04:50.510> they're

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
interesting to see just how they're

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.270 
interesting to see just how they're
going<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.930> start<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.320> integrate<00:04:51.590> all<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.010> these

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
going to start to integrate all of these

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.550 
going to start to integrate all of these
different<00:04:52.460> services<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.560> different

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
different services and different

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.610 
different services and different
offerings<00:04:54.980> in<00:04:55.340> terms<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.640> API<00:04:56.090> anyway<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.170> think

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
offerings in terms of API anyway I think

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.740 
offerings in terms of API anyway I think
that's<00:04:58.190> just<00:04:58.400> about<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.240> for<00:04:59.390> this<00:04:59.570> particular

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
that's just about it for this particular

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.750 
that's just about it for this particular
video<00:05:00.110> hopefully<00:05:00.440> you've<00:05:00.860> enjoyed<00:05:00.920> it<00:05:01.340> or<00:05:01.460> see
