00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
responsibility so every time you get an

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.750 
responsibility so every time you get an
idea<00:05:10.550> there<00:05:11.540> is<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.920> responsibility<00:05:12.920> that<00:05:13.220> will

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
idea there is a responsibility that will

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.130 
idea there is a responsibility that will
come<00:05:14.060> with<00:05:14.510> your<00:05:14.840> idea<00:05:15.500> that<00:05:16.100> only<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:17.330> can<00:05:17.810> do

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
come with your idea that only you can do

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.450 
come with your idea that only you can do
so<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.310> big<00:05:19.550> idea<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.390> if<00:05:21.170> you<00:05:22.070> have
