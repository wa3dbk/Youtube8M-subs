just run that down and as you can see
from<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.540> first<00:03:56.810> talk<00:03:57.080> trap<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:58.370> bottom

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
from the first talk trap that bottom

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.930 
from the first talk trap that bottom
trap<00:03:59.540> is<00:04:00.200> going<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.530> be<00:04:00.680> located<00:04:01.370> right<00:04:01.670> on<00:04:01.730> the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
trap is going to be located right on the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.910 
trap is going to be located right on the
bottom<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:02.900> I'm<00:04:03.020> going<00:04:03.170> to<00:04:03.200> angle<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.740> a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
bottom so I'm going to angle this a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.360 
bottom so I'm going to angle this a
blip-it<00:04:04.310> hit<00:04:04.550> ordered<00:04:04.730> angle<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:09.100> just<00:04:10.100> want

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
blip-it hit ordered angle I just want

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.060 
blip-it hit ordered angle I just want
that<00:04:10.580> top<00:04:10.940> trap<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:12.140> kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.470> got<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.680> feel

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
that top trap you kind of got to feel

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.780 
that top trap you kind of got to feel
because<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.270> these<00:04:14.450> cattails<00:04:15.790> where

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
because of all these cattails where

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.080 
because of all these cattails where
you're<00:04:17.000> pushing<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.220> push<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.609> down<00:04:19.640> in

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you're pushing and I push it down in

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.920 
you're pushing and I push it down in
until<00:04:20.480> that<00:04:21.070> top<00:04:22.070> one<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.970> right<00:04:23.360> below<00:04:23.600> the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
until that top one is right below the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.070 
until that top one is right below the
ice<00:04:24.110> about<00:04:24.970> three<00:04:25.970> four<00:04:26.210> inches<00:04:26.240> because

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
ice about three four inches because

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.110 
ice about three four inches because
they're<00:04:27.440> muskrats<00:04:27.980> they<00:04:28.160> commonly<00:04:28.550> travel

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
they're muskrats they commonly travel

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:37.740 
they're muskrats they commonly travel
right<00:04:29.300> underneath<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:30.560> ice<00:04:35.320> here<00:04:36.320> I've<00:04:36.500> got

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
right underneath the ice here I've got

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.680 
right underneath the ice here I've got
the<00:04:38.750> 360<00:04:39.470> Pole<00:04:39.820> and<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.360> keep<00:04:41.510> them

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
the 360 Pole and I like to keep them

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.900 
the 360 Pole and I like to keep them
horizontal<00:04:42.410> now<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.010> muskrats<00:04:43.640> going<00:04:43.850> to

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
horizontal now the muskrats going to

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.330 
horizontal now the muskrats going to
come<00:04:44.090> down<00:04:44.530> grab<00:04:45.530> ahold<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.980> it<00:04:46.100> he's

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
come down grab ahold of it he's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.159 
come down grab ahold of it he's
committed<00:04:46.880> he's<00:04:46.940> going<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.210> be<00:04:47.360> caught<00:04:47.630> it's

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
committed he's going to be caught it's

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.520 
committed he's going to be caught it's
going<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.530> fall<00:04:48.880> it's<00:04:49.880> going<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> fall<00:04:50.540> now

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
going to fall it's going to fall now

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.950 
going to fall it's going to fall now
this<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:52.010> I<00:04:52.130> do<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.490> short<00:04:52.850> chain<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.900> I

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
this one I do have short chain but I

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.940 
this one I do have short chain but I
have<00:04:54.340> chain<00:04:55.340> links<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:56.060> don't<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.620> but

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
have chain links I don't like that but

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.740 
have chain links I don't like that but
I'm<00:04:58.070> showing<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.669> way<00:04:58.790> some<00:04:59.120> people<00:04:59.330> use

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
I'm showing you the way some people use

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.110 
I'm showing you the way some people use
the<00:04:59.960> system<00:05:00.470> because<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.370> want<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.729> go<00:05:01.850> back

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the system because they want to go back

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.740 
the system because they want to go back
and<00:05:02.450> use<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.690> trap<00:05:03.410> for<00:05:04.190> regular<00:05:04.700> 110<00:05:05.330> sets

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
and use that trap for regular 110 sets

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.200 
and use that trap for regular 110 sets
for<00:05:06.020> mink<00:05:06.290> or<00:05:06.590> whatnot<00:05:06.950> with<00:05:07.370> just<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.729> stick<00:05:08.030> in

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
for mink or whatnot with just a stick in

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.189 
for mink or whatnot with just a stick in
a<00:05:08.300> run

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.110 

don't<00:05:13.530> have<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.919> cut<00:05:14.219> all<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.520> chains<00:05:14.819> down

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
don't have to cut all the chains down

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.149 
don't have to cut all the chains down
like<00:05:15.389> I<00:05:19.219> find<00:05:20.219> a<00:05:20.370> spot<00:05:20.669> there<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.129> just

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
like I find a spot there and I just

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.390 
like I find a spot there and I just
shove<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.759> down<00:05:23.789> oh<00:05:24.800> that's<00:05:25.800> pretty<00:05:26.069> tough

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
shove it down oh that's pretty tough

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.629 
shove it down oh that's pretty tough
right<00:05:26.669> there<00:05:30.860> wrong<00:05:31.860> we'll<00:05:32.039> put<00:05:32.249> it<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.490> an

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
right there wrong we'll put it on an

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.040 
right there wrong we'll put it on an
angle

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.950 

and<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.140> shove<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.680> down<00:05:39.060> until<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.300> top

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
and I shove that down until that top

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.850 
and I shove that down until that top
drop<00:05:43.590> there<00:05:44.590> we<00:05:44.770> go

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
drop there we go

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.320 
drop there we go
this<00:05:47.860> one<00:05:48.040> here<00:05:48.250> when<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.520> was<00:05:48.640> cutting<00:05:49.030> in<00:05:49.180> I

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
this one here when I was cutting in I

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
this one here when I was cutting in I
hid<00:05:49.540> bud<00:05:50.130> so<00:05:51.390> that's<00:05:52.390> basically<00:05:52.750> what<00:05:52.990> I<00:05:53.020> got

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
hid bud so that's basically what I got

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.990 
hid bud so that's basically what I got
guys<00:05:53.650> gals<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:54.840> appreciate<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:56.020> and<00:05:56.340> hey<00:05:57.340> give

it a try I'm telling you you're going to

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.230 
it a try I'm telling you you're going to
catch<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.920> lot<00:06:00.100> of<00:06:00.130> muskrats<00:06:00.700> under<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.090> ice

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
catch a lot of muskrats under the ice

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.850 
catch a lot of muskrats under the ice
and<00:06:01.570> it's<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.170> simple

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
and it's that simple
