and take the flap and fold it back over

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.360 
and take the flap and fold it back over
so<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.650> something<00:03:11.860> that<00:03:12.010> looks<00:03:12.130> like

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
so you have something that looks like

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.450 
so you have something that looks like
that<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:14.320> do<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.620> same<00:03:14.770> thing<00:03:15.070> on<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.400> other

now fold that over need the same thing
on<00:03:37.909> this<00:03:38.030> side<00:03:38.799> flap<00:03:41.019> open<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.319> up<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:43.840> fold<00:03:44.840> it

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
on this side flap open it up and fold it

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.190 
on this side flap open it up and fold it
flat<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:47.530> flip<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.650> over<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:49.659> now<00:03:50.659> you<00:03:50.720> end<00:03:51.049> up

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
flat and flip it over and now you end up

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.309 
flat and flip it over and now you end up
with<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:53.659> you're<00:03:53.810> going<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.989> do<00:03:54.140> now

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
with that so what you're going to do now

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.470 
with that so what you're going to do now
is<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.500> they<00:03:57.950> can<00:03:58.129> open<00:03:58.430> up<00:03:58.549> just

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
is with this and they can open up just

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.610 
is with this and they can open up just
like<00:03:59.690> that<00:04:00.670> you're<00:04:01.670> going<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:01.909> take<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.329> and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
like that you're going to take it and

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.970 
like that you're going to take it and
you're<00:04:03.620> going<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.769> fold<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:07.010> way<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:09.739> do

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
you're going to fold it that way you do

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.380 
you're going to fold it that way you do
the<00:04:10.099> other<00:04:10.280> side<00:04:10.510> same<00:04:11.510> level<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.379> middle

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
the other side same level to the middle

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.289 
the other side same level to the middle
so<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:14.420> makes<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.810> point<00:04:15.049> on<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.470> end<00:04:18.820> now<00:04:19.820> with

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
so it makes a point on the end now with

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.480 
so it makes a point on the end now with
the<00:04:20.449> point<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.959> made<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.500> pocket

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the point that you made in the pocket

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.730 
the point that you made in the pocket
underneath<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.240> right<00:04:23.539> there<00:04:23.780> you're<00:04:24.590> going

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
underneath it right there you're going

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.900 
underneath it right there you're going
to<00:04:24.800> take<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.130> point<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.639> you're<00:04:25.760> going<00:04:25.850> to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
to take the point and you're going to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.110 
to take the point and you're going to
fold<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.389> into<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:27.110> pocket<00:04:27.639> just<00:04:28.639> like<00:04:28.760> that

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.070 

and<00:04:32.120> we're<00:04:32.270> going<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.419> do<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.600> same<00:04:32.780> thing<00:04:32.990> on

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
and we're going to do the same thing on

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.529 
and we're going to do the same thing on
the<00:04:33.199> other<00:04:33.229> side<00:04:33.699> take<00:04:34.699> the<00:04:34.910> tip<00:04:36.039> fold<00:04:37.039> it<00:04:37.539> take

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
the other side take the tip fold it take

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:45.320 
the other side take the tip fold it take
the<00:04:38.720> other<00:04:38.840> tip<00:04:40.450> make<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.479> point

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:54.710 

and<00:04:46.330> fold<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.229> down<00:04:47.409> into<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.069> pocket

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.200 

so<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.780> have<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.850> know<00:04:57.850> what<00:04:58.000> you're<00:04:58.090> going

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
to do is with the white triangle at the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.700 
to do is with the white triangle at the
bottom<00:05:00.490> you're<00:05:00.910> going<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.120> fold<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:02.530> this

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
bottom you're going to fold it to this

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.320 
bottom you're going to fold it to this
point<00:05:02.890> here<00:05:04.350> into<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.470> point<00:05:05.800> here<00:05:06.330> just

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
point here into this point here just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.500 
point here into this point here just
going<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.510> fold<00:05:07.690> it<00:05:07.870> down<00:05:08.230> to<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:09.390> just<00:05:10.390> like

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
going to fold it down to it just like

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.680 
going to fold it down to it just like
that<00:05:10.980> increase<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.440> have<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:15.690> night

that increase it so you have that night

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.050 
that increase it so you have that night
on<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.020> center<00:05:17.770> line<00:05:17.800> here<00:05:18.430> across<00:05:18.790> the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
on the center line here across the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.480 
on the center line here across the
middle<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.510> you<00:05:20.290> folded<00:05:20.500> 22<00:05:20.950> points<00:05:21.310> to

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
middle that you folded 22 points to

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.460 
middle that you folded 22 points to
you're<00:05:22.240> just<00:05:22.390> going<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.630> fold<00:05:22.870> that<00:05:23.110> triangle

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
you're just going to fold that triangle

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.560 
you're just going to fold that triangle
back<00:05:24.720> just<00:05:25.720> like<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:28.240> now<00:05:28.360> what<00:05:28.450> you're

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
back just like that so now what you're

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.680 
back just like that so now what you're
going<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.840> do<00:05:28.960> is<00:05:29.830> with<00:05:30.640> these<00:05:30.850> two<00:05:31.090> pockets

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
going to do is with these two pockets

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.090 
going to do is with these two pockets
that<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:31.990> made<00:05:34.470> you're<00:05:35.470> just<00:05:35.620> going<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.830> put

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
that you made you're just going to put

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.260 
that you made you're just going to put
this<00:05:36.150> down<00:05:37.150> into<00:05:37.420> there<00:05:37.740> just<00:05:38.740> like<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.270> and

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
this down into there just like that and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.010 
this down into there just like that and
then<00:05:40.750> let's<00:05:40.930> say<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.080> make<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.410> noragami<00:05:41.650> anger
