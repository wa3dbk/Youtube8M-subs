00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
see what else we got here

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
see what else we got here
frontside<00:00:32.610> 180<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.329> bad<00:00:33.600> obviously<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.559> can

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
frontside 180 not bad obviously you can

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
frontside 180 not bad obviously you can
work<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.130> landing<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> rolling<00:00:36.690> away<00:00:36.840> switch

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
work on landing and rolling away switch

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.190 
work on landing and rolling away switch
I<00:00:37.739> didn't<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.790> any<00:00:38.969> backside<00:00:39.420> 180<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> there

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
I didn't see any backside 180 in there

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
I didn't see any backside 180 in there
but<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.920> kickflip<00:00:41.340> actually<00:00:41.730> looks<00:00:41.940> really

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
but your kickflip actually looks really

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.110 
but your kickflip actually looks really
good<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.040> then<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> hill<00:00:44.340> flip<00:00:44.640> obviously<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
good and then the hill flip obviously I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.400 
good and then the hill flip obviously I
think<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.750> better<00:00:45.899> ones<00:00:46.170> than<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
think you can do better ones than that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
think you can do better ones than that
alright<00:00:53.059> cool<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.090> let's<00:00:54.480> check<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.870> these

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
alright cool so let's check out these

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
alright cool so let's check out these
tre<00:00:55.500> flips<00:00:56.510> your<00:00:57.510> feet<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.020> close

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
tre flips your feet are really close

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.860 
tre flips your feet are really close
together<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> bad<00:00:59.670> thing<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.510> because

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
together not a bad thing to do because

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
together not a bad thing to do because
it's<00:01:01.530> definitely<00:01:02.039> easier<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.910> spin<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.229> whole

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it's definitely easier to spin the whole

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's definitely easier to spin the whole
360<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.400> feet<00:01:05.610> close<00:01:05.820> together<00:01:06.030> like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
360 with your feet close together like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.039 
360 with your feet close together like
that<00:01:07.580> yeah<00:01:08.580> sometimes<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.570> making<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that yeah sometimes it's making the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
that yeah sometimes it's making the
whole<00:01:10.229> 360<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.189> usually<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.869> doing<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
whole 360 but usually it's just doing a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.789 
whole 360 but usually it's just doing a
270<00:01:13.970> alright<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.500> thank<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.650> watching

so yeah these are all the tricks ollie
frontside<00:01:44.170> 180<00:01:44.470> backs<00:01:44.710> I'm<00:01:44.920> going<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.100> pop

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
frontside 180 backs I'm going to pop

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.430 
frontside 180 backs I'm going to pop
shove<00:01:45.730> frontside<00:01:46.300> shove<00:01:46.570> he'll<00:01:46.900> flip<00:01:47.200> and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
shove frontside shove he'll flip and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.760 
shove frontside shove he'll flip and
then<00:01:47.530> kickflip<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.220> then<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.330> between<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
then kickflip and then in between the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.250 
then kickflip and then in between the
360<00:01:51.400> flip<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.210> end<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.630> kickflip<00:01:53.080> I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
360 flip and the end of the kickflip I

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.480 
360 flip and the end of the kickflip I
would<00:01:53.500> throw<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:55.060> varial<00:01:55.690> flip<00:01:56.490> probably

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
would throw in the varial flip probably

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.390 
would throw in the varial flip probably
backside<00:01:58.090> flip<00:01:58.360> frontside<00:01:59.020> flip<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.770> a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
backside flip frontside flip and a

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.330 
backside flip frontside flip and a
couple<00:02:00.640> other<00:02:00.970> ones<00:02:01.240> because<00:02:01.660> there<00:02:02.410> is<00:02:02.680> just

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
couple other ones because there is just

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.530 
couple other ones because there is just
some<00:02:03.520> easier<00:02:03.970> gradients<00:02:04.750> as<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.710> said<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
some easier gradients as I said for the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.680 
some easier gradients as I said for the
most<00:02:07.840> part<00:02:08.170> you're<00:02:08.740> doing<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.700> 70s<00:02:10.360> you're<00:02:10.510> not

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
most part you're doing to 70s you're not

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.830 
most part you're doing to 70s you're not
quite<00:02:11.140> doing<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.650> full<00:02:11.890> 360<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.420> think

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
quite doing the full 360 so I think

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.410 
quite doing the full 360 so I think
learning<00:02:14.200> varial<00:02:14.890> flip<00:02:15.160> before<00:02:15.370> getting<00:02:16.150> into

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
learning varial flip before getting into

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.050 
learning varial flip before getting into
360<00:02:17.410> flip<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.070> create<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> huge

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
360 flip is going to create a huge

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.390 
360 flip is going to create a huge
better<00:02:22.060> step<00:02:22.600> for<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.170> go<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.220> yeah

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
better step for you to go on so yeah

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.880 
better step for you to go on so yeah
again<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.850> would<00:02:25.120> really<00:02:25.600> highly<00:02:26.350> highly

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
again I would really highly highly

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.210 
again I would really highly highly
recommend<00:02:27.430> learning<00:02:27.610> varial<00:02:28.300> flips<00:02:29.040> cool<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
recommend learning varial flips cool so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.400 
recommend learning varial flips cool so
yeah<00:02:30.340> your<00:02:30.550> back<00:02:30.760> foot<00:02:31.090> scoops<00:02:31.660> pretty<00:02:32.080> hard

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
yeah your back foot scoops pretty hard

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.030 
yeah your back foot scoops pretty hard
but<00:02:32.739> again<00:02:33.040> your<00:02:33.940> your<00:02:34.380> board<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.770> not

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
but again your your board is just not

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
but again your your board is just not
making<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.610> fully<00:02:37.000> all<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.420> way<00:02:37.690> around<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
making it fully all the way around and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.910 
making it fully all the way around and
we<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.489> got<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.670> work<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.920> just

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
we really got to work on that and just

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.670 
we really got to work on that and just
getting<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> popped<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.000> rotated<00:02:43.720> fully<00:02:44.110> so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
getting it popped and rotated fully so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.770 
getting it popped and rotated fully so
that<00:02:44.860> then<00:02:45.100> your<00:02:45.370> front<00:02:45.700> foot<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.360> able

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
that then your front foot is there able

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.660 
that then your front foot is there able
to<00:02:46.959> catch<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:49.209> takes<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.190> force<00:02:51.190> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
to catch it it takes a lot of force and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.390 
to catch it it takes a lot of force and
you<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.080> have<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.470> scooped<00:02:54.130> down

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
you just have to have that scooped down

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.790 
you just have to have that scooped down
with<00:02:54.550> your<00:02:54.730> back<00:02:54.940> foot<00:02:55.180> super<00:02:55.780> super<00:02:56.230> super

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
with your back foot super super super

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.070 
with your back foot super super super
well<00:02:56.980> if<00:02:57.820> you're<00:02:58.030> totally<00:02:58.450> against<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.050> idea

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
well if you're totally against the idea

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.170 
well if you're totally against the idea
of<00:02:59.530> learning<00:02:59.920> how<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.160> do<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.520> varial<00:03:00.910> flip

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
of learning how to do the varial flip

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.560 
of learning how to do the varial flip
you<00:03:01.570> can<00:03:01.870> practice<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.070> 360<00:03:03.700> flip<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:04.150> just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
you can practice the 360 flip with just

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.320 
you can practice the 360 flip with just
scooping<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.709> super<00:03:06.100> hard<00:03:06.340> stepping<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.180> with

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
scooping it super hard stepping off with

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.660 
scooping it super hard stepping off with
your<00:03:07.510> back<00:03:07.720> foot<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.380> then<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.430> leaving

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
your back foot and then just leaving

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.550 
your back foot and then just leaving
your<00:03:10.000> front<00:03:10.209> foot<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.600> there<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.170> step<00:03:11.530> your

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
your front foot on there so step your

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
your front foot on there so step your
back<00:03:11.890> foot<00:03:11.950> down<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.670> ground<00:03:12.910> leave<00:03:13.750> your

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
back foot down to the ground leave your

back foot down to the ground leave your
front<00:03:14.200> foot<00:03:14.410> up<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.739> air<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.400> just

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
front foot up in the air and just

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.170 
front foot up in the air and just
practice<00:03:16.300> catching<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.290> board<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:18.700> this

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
practice catching the board just this

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.229 
practice catching the board just this
step<00:03:19.480> right<00:03:19.890> there<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:21.790> obviously

that 360 flip all the way around

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.050 
that 360 flip all the way around
but<00:03:33.480> again<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.080> would<00:03:34.530> definitely<00:03:35.060> learn

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
but again I would definitely learn

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.020 
but again I would definitely learn
varial<00:03:36.600> flips<00:03:36.840> first<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.740> that's<00:03:38.550> what<00:03:38.790> most

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030

people do that's what I did and that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.950 
people do that's what I did and that
definitely<00:03:41.280> helped<00:03:41.580> me<00:03:41.700> learn<00:03:41.820> 360<00:03:42.210> flips<00:03:42.810> in

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960
