00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.800
 hi girls today kim inspired makeup 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.939
 kardashian or the make up I have 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 made at her wedding is a make up on 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.199
 however, tones of gold and bronze 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 I like it very much and I wanted a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 moment reinterpret my way 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000
 I hope you like it and leave you at 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.079
 video 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 let's start right away on the whole eyelid 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 africa a primer to catch the trick 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.370
 all day in this case I put 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.309
 a foundation because I don't need that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 the best makeup for many hours 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.000
 after which I take a creamy eye shadow 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.969
 orange color and afflict him in the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.219
 inner part of the eyelid and al 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 upstairs we give a nice eye shadow in 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.589
 gold-colored powder and this I pass it on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.290
 the entire upper eyelid then 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.820
 inside and also outside externally 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 well then i take two types of browns or 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 pay a lighter one which I will put more 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 externally in the crease of the eye e 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.549
 a darker one that I will always put in the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.439
 eye crease however with more 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.159
 precision internally and I also carry 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.820
 towards the inner part of the eye 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.970
 I also make the final corner in this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.920
 I always take with the browns I take 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.009
 two bronzes on bronze- colored bronzes 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.729
 a clearer one that I apply it in 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.540
 outside of the eye there is in this 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.320
 then the darker one I apply with more 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.770
 precision to give three-dimensionality 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 always to the eye in the v however being 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.789
 more internally and then fades everything 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.789
 being always very precise 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.739
 now hangs an opaque black color and lo 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.530
 however, I always apply in the pen 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.610
 in the b, however, in this case I must stay 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 very very precise and not 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.660
 go too externally with the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:30.080
 nuance so I do this little p 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.080
 and then very little smoke very little 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 now I take a satin and vanilla color 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.280
 I apply it in the inner corner to make a 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 nice point of light under the arch 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.819
 eyebrows and fades well I take them from 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.760
 new black with angled brush e 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:58.159
 I make a sort of eyeliner then 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.530
 spume rho from bottom to top I want 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.489
 a very very nuanced eyeliner must 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.760
 see each other more than anything else now 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.069
 I then momentarily pass the base 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.099
 I apply the foundation I cover all well 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.459
 imperfections by tapping lost the 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:22.099
 face the foundation I cover the dark circles i 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.389
 pimples a forum an incarnate and then 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.359
 I'll show you a little trick 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.480
 to give a clearer line to ours 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.099
 makeup and cleaning it opened like this 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.139
 with the sponge the foundation you see 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.739
 as it is the result is much cleaner 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:40.099
 more net and also eliminates the excess of 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.940
 trick that fell under the eye then 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.819
 I take a gel eyeliner and I do one 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.190
 very very thin line and even the 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.090
 final language with a small brush of 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.090
 these that help me a lot 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.549
 then picks up the angled brush that 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.129
 had used it before to apply black 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.799
 umberto black and logical also in the part 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.659
 lower outer eye then I take 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:17.039
 this bronze and gold colored bronze color 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:19.440
 gold is first to color spike ready 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.690
 in the lower external part and in the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 inner part always lower than peak 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.440
 in gold color 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.020
 now resumes the initial vanilla color 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.270
 the satin one and I make the luceri point 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.470
 I define the light point in the part well 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.979
 inside with an ivory-colored pencil 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:41.520
 I trace the eyelid the internal rhyme for 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.270
 open the look make it more rested 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.250
 and so on 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.830
 I pick up your chestnuts what it is 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.750
 light is the darker and redesign the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.539
 my eyebrows imitating those a little 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.880
 of kim kardashian then with the one over 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:05:00.240
 dark I do all the outside and 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.460
 then with the clearer one I redesign the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.910
 part 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.360
 initial of the eyebrow or that 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.919
 inside I fold my eyelashes and put on 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.229
 mascara this step is not seen 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.660
 why not registered 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:21.710
 now let's move on to the contouring I take one 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.130
 land clear enough and I go to 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:30.169
 redefine the cheekbones outside the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:33.560
 temples and fades 1 well now I take blush 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.479
 rosato and I apply it on the cheekbones 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.160
 but later I will notice that 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.820
 this one is slightly too light and 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.210
 I don't like it and then I'll change it later 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.310
 disco 1 faded well and now we pass 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.130
 to the very important illuminant with a 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:54.070
 I apply a fan brush over it 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.070
 the cheekbones on the back of the nose 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.160
 here it is also on the back of the nose 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:09.010
 towards the front in the middle of the 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.780
 lips to give volume and within 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.669
 cupid and a little tool because the 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:18.639
 mine and elusive with a pencil then colored 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.320
 brown I call them all 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:24.610
 outline of my lips but redesign 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.320
 also the inside this so I refer again 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.720
 to say the usual look of kim 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.360
 kardashian not this photo of 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.410
 usually she uses this morning brown and 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.789
 then with a light flesh-colored wind 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.789
 it fills all the lips 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.669
 I really didn't like the result 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.979
 not at all having my lips a little 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.970
 too pink and so nothing 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:53.800
 I do them again I change color I go up 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.889
 rosato then I apply a pencil first 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.449
 rosy all the lips so I do the 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:04.360
 gas outline smoke a little too 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:08.979
 internally and then with a naked eye shadow 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.830
 pink I fill my lips later 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.900
 apply a decidedly more rosy blush 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.280
 a little more fuchsia on the cheekbones I have to 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.120
 to say that in this way I like the look 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.250
 much much more 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.660
