 device more than 50% so good 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.310
 to download it, we must 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.120
 select the volume button below the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.150
 power button and the button in this case 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.470

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.340
 download and now let's connect it 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.560
 using the usb cable to our 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.849
 computer as you can see I have them already 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.800

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.260

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.530
 device 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.930
 we wait a bit to not detect them 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.500
 if they do not detect, then try another 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.500
 USB port 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.599

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.680
 I did 1 with 8 and we must appear 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.250
 this little button I do not know what color is 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.620
 yellow 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.569
 I do not know how they want to see you but 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.610
 it's yellow for me until we 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.290
 this yellow box does not matter 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.420
 the number that is in here only with 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.670
 that is in yellow and that our 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.310
 samsung galaxy is this one with the letter don 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.410
 wedding remember that I'll leave it at 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.200
 a position where it should not be 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.690
 disconnect the both the device or 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.030
 you who are going to move something here to 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.340
 your computer once done this let's go 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.150
 to start and as you can see here we are going to 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.600
 appear some commands like here is 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.600
 as an accountant 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.940
 here our samsung galaxy after 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.610
 continues to equal a 9 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.290
 we wait for it to finish approximately 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.780
 in this step it will last 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.270
 approximately between three and five 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.010
 minutes likewise and here he tells us then 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.250
 everything that is updating in our 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.220
 device here we wait for you to approach 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.010
 a little bit and good here tells us everything 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.290
 that you are installing to be updated 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.290
 the image packages the system 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.360
 I'm going to pass this video and already when 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.580
 I have finished, I am going to tell you that we are going 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.580
 to do and after all this 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.980
 well this until we appear this 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.940
 option that says here below closed 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.530
 airport and white a reboot and it's going to 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.730
 Restart our device as 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.550
 will be able to see and it is restarting 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.890
 several times it is because it is updated 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.170
 the system should not be afraid not 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.230
 Nothing will happen to you and here it says 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.750
 just as the system is resisting 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.550
 that is constantly restarting and 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.350
 approximately this that already goes like 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.500
