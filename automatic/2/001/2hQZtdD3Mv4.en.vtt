00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to my channel my name 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.390
 It's Mrs. Lenderman and good as you will know 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.550
 marvel who is the creator of great and 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.500
 fabulous comics has signed a contract 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.719
 with disney to make a series of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 spiderman called ultimate spiderman 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.000
 and that's why I decided to make a criticism of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.300
 ultimate spiderman to start 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 we will talk about the main characters 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.050
 one of the characters that have 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 changed enough would be that hyper part 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 because his personality has been 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.689
 turned very mocking and silly in addition to 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.309
 that has enough errors in the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 program when in comics and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 hyperparker movies is a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 teenager very smart and has a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 new sarcastic also always has 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.469
 bad luck in your life something that in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 I was really disappointed in this program 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.780
 was that the main characters like 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 harry osborn the leg and median almost no 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 appear in the chapters or are 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.879
 important in the program besides they 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.100
 the comics sound like in the movies 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.410
 and prepare that he has loving relationships 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.930
 with many girls but in ultimate 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.690
 spiderman cares more for his friends 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 that women has perhaps become gay 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.650
 very well now we will talk about the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.049
 story to start in some series 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 of spiderman deviate a bit from the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.100
 story but in ultimate spiderman the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 They fucked all in first in history 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 of the program the spiderman is by 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.399
 below the avengers besides that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 works with superhero teams 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.500
 pathetic who rarely help him 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.840
 in fight another thing that I did not like for 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.090
 nothing would be that spiderman use 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 vehicles and weapons in the program even 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 receives help from the avengers which 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 undoubtedly disappoints this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.729
 spiderman is one of the most 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 depressing without meaning besides that of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.369
 that in each chapter 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 there is never action or fights 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.170
 entertaining also the sound music not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 It's very good and the story has nothing 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.240
 of meaning is not related to the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.490
 true spiderman the truth if they are 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.770
 big fans of spiderman do not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 I would recommend this program without a doubt 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 caught a great marvel hero but the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.770
 I really do not have any hope and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 I hope marvel creates a new sequel 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.350
 of spiderman in which it relates to 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.750
 the comics 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.729
