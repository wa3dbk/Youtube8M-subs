brown gluey substance if you overcook it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.629 
brown gluey substance if you overcook it
you<00:04:03.359> will<00:04:03.540> burn<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.109> giving<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.950> very<00:04:05.340> very

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
you will burn it giving it a very very

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.809 
you will burn it giving it a very very
unpleasant<00:04:06.180> taste<00:04:06.799> once<00:04:07.799> your<00:04:08.010> soup<00:04:08.250> reaches

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
unpleasant taste once your soup reaches

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.809 
unpleasant taste once your soup reaches
this<00:04:09.450> stage<00:04:10.139> turn<00:04:10.620> off<00:04:10.889> your<00:04:10.920> slow<00:04:11.370> cooker<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
this stage turn off your slow cooker and

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.330 
this stage turn off your slow cooker and
let<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.239> cool<00:04:12.450> completely<00:04:12.510> then<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.889> can<00:04:14.069> turn

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
let it cool completely then you can turn

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.520 
let it cool completely then you can turn
the<00:04:14.400> gel<00:04:14.940> out<00:04:14.970> onto<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> cloth

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.090 

now<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.459> soup<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.120> still<00:04:20.450> very<00:04:20.920> gelatinous<00:04:21.920> to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
now the soup is still very gelatinous to

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.250 
now the soup is still very gelatinous to
get<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.730> point<00:04:22.940> where<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.720> can<00:04:23.930> store

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
get it to the point where you can store

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.350 
get it to the point where you can store
it<00:04:24.440> put<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:24.920> your<00:04:25.040> pocket<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.730> needs<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.210> be

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
it put it in your pocket it needs to be

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.140 
it put it in your pocket it needs to be
dried<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.470> cannot<00:04:28.040> do<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.610> with<00:04:28.880> heat

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
dried now you cannot do this with heat

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.110 
dried now you cannot do this with heat
any<00:04:30.080> temperature<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.950> heat<00:04:31.130> we'll<00:04:31.310> just<00:04:31.640> turn

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
any temperature of heat we'll just turn

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.060 
any temperature of heat we'll just turn
this<00:04:32.300> into<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.600> liquid<00:04:33.020> again<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.500> then<00:04:33.890> you'll

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
this into a liquid again and then you'll

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.210 
this into a liquid again and then you'll
just<00:04:34.130> burn<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.610> so<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.630> needs<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.200> be<00:04:36.380> done

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
just burn it so it needs to be done

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.520 
just burn it so it needs to be done
without<00:04:37.660> heat<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.870> can<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.140> this<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.440> a

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
without heat you can do this in a

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.520 
without heat you can do this in a
dehydrator<00:04:39.700> but<00:04:40.700> you<00:04:41.600> need<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.930> make<00:04:42.260> sure<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
dehydrator but you need to make sure the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.880 
dehydrator but you need to make sure the
dehydrator<00:04:43.160> doesn't<00:04:43.580> heat<00:04:44.000> anything<00:04:44.570> up<00:04:44.890> the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
dehydrator doesn't heat anything up the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.340 
dehydrator doesn't heat anything up the
the<00:04:46.340> period<00:04:46.790> recipe<00:04:47.270> actually<00:04:47.720> suggests
