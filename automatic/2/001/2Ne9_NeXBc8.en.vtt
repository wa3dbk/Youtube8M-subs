thousand<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.490> faster<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
thousand to go faster so that's all

separate<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.580> legs<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.630> here's<00:02:43.110> where<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
separate the legs and here's where I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.760 
separate the legs and here's where I
probably<00:02:43.530> pause<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.600> splicing<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> video<00:02:46.440> so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
probably pause or splicing the video so

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.150 
probably pause or splicing the video so
that<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> starts<00:02:47.520> right<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:48.260> okay<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:50.070> they

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
that it starts right here okay so they

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.710 
that it starts right here okay so they
want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.760> piece<00:02:51.000> separator<00:02:51.570> out<00:02:53.720> on

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
want to take this piece separator out on

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
to do back here is rotate this around

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.770 
to do back here is rotate this around
and<00:03:24.920> then<00:03:25.920> what<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> can<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.630> insert<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and then what you can do is insert the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.910 
and then what you can do is insert the
cyber<00:03:27.990> key<00:03:28.260> cyber<00:03:28.920> key<00:03:29.130> power<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.620> then<00:03:31.830> he

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
cyber key cyber key power and then he

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:42.290 
cyber key cyber key power and then he
has<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.310> going<00:03:32.610> on<00:03:32.820> tour<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.850> then<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.150> can

has that going on tour and then you can
insert<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.990> into<00:03:43.650> his<00:03:44.280> swings<00:03:44.880> at<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.120> of

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
insert this into his swings at one of

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:55.630 
insert this into his swings at one of
his<00:03:45.420> hands<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.170> spires<00:03:49.410> missile<00:03:53.330> and

so even with that without editing this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
so even with that without editing this
is<00:03:59.400> about<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.700> four<00:04:00.120> minute<00:04:00.360> video<00:04:00.510> if<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.260> was

look at the box well actually before we

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.720 
look at the box well actually before we
do<00:04:06.150> that<00:04:06.920> one<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.040> details<00:04:08.310> are<00:04:08.430> likely

we have the mint and sealed box of the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.140 
we have the mint and sealed box of the
hotshot<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.480> just<00:04:30.660> showed<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:32.090> take<00:04:33.090> a

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
hotshot that I just showed you take a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.460 
hotshot that I just showed you take a
look<00:04:33.270> at<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.420> back<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:36.290> got<00:04:37.290> some

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
look at the back and got some

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:47.229 
look at the back and got some
information<00:04:37.740> there

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:47.239 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:51.079 

now<00:04:48.239> he<00:04:48.300> has<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.139> repaint<00:04:49.679> which<00:04:50.369> never

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:51.089 
now he has a repaint which never

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.719 
now he has a repaint which never
appeared<00:04:51.449> in<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.719> actual<00:04:52.399> cartoon<00:04:53.399> series

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
appeared in the actual cartoon series

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.040 
appeared in the actual cartoon series
but<00:04:54.239> he<00:04:55.199> has<00:04:55.439> accel<00:04:56.039> y<00:04:56.069> on<00:04:56.309> which<00:04:57.179> very<00:04:57.719> very

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
but he has accel y on which very very

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.229 
but he has accel y on which very very
much<00:04:58.229> looks<00:04:58.529> like<00:04:58.739> a<00:04:59.039> what<00:04:59.879> should<00:05:00.089> have<00:05:00.209> been

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:00.239 
much looks like a what should have been

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:01.879 
much looks like a what should have been
called<00:05:00.539> or<00:05:00.989> maybe<00:05:01.139> there's<00:05:01.379> legal<00:05:01.559> reasons

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
called or maybe there's legal reasons

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.859 
called or maybe there's legal reasons
why<00:05:02.009> I<00:05:02.039> didn't<00:05:02.429> call<00:05:02.489> him<00:05:02.789> but<00:05:03.089> should<00:05:03.749> have

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:03.869 
why I didn't call him but should have

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.600 
why I didn't call him but should have
been<00:05:03.959> called<00:05:04.169> hot<00:05:04.949> rod<00:05:05.159> but<00:05:05.279> he's<00:05:05.429> called

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
been called hot rod but he's called

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.249 
been called hot rod but he's called
excellion<00:05:05.999> and<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.449> can<00:05:06.569> notice<00:05:06.749> he<00:05:06.899> has<00:05:07.050> this

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
excellion and you can notice he has this

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.449 
excellion and you can notice he has this
silver<00:05:07.909> silver<00:05:08.959> wheat<00:05:09.959> bread<00:05:10.259> and<00:05:10.559> gold

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:11.459 
silver silver wheat bread and gold

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:18.739 
silver silver wheat bread and gold
accent<00:05:12.439> paint<00:05:13.439> scheme<00:05:14.629> so<00:05:17.209> he<00:05:18.209> also<00:05:18.419> has<00:05:18.659> an

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:18.749 
accent paint scheme so he also has an

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.769 
accent paint scheme so he also has an
Autobot<00:05:19.999> take<00:05:20.999> a<00:05:21.029> look<00:05:21.149> at<00:05:21.269> this<00:05:21.330> packaging

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
Autobot take a look at this packaging

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:30.139 
Autobot take a look at this packaging
here<00:05:25.939> yep<00:05:26.939> so<00:05:28.249> under<00:05:29.249> how<00:05:29.339> they<00:05:29.490> compare<00:05:29.699> the

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:30.149 
here yep so under how they compare the

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:32.179 
here yep so under how they compare the
two<00:05:30.360> stats<00:05:31.019> here<00:05:31.439> let's<00:05:31.649> take<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.889> look<00:05:32.069> at<00:05:32.129> the

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
two stats here let's take a look at the

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:39.049 
two stats here let's take a look at the
back<00:05:36.499> transformation<00:05:37.499> the<00:05:38.309> bad<00:05:38.519> part<00:05:38.939> is

00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:39.059 
back transformation the bad part is

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.569 
back transformation the bad part is
suppose<00:05:39.389> is<00:05:39.809> you<00:05:40.649> have<00:05:40.800> all<00:05:40.979> these<00:05:41.129> screws

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:41.579 
suppose is you have all these screws

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:47.600 
suppose is you have all these screws
showing<00:05:42.029> here<00:05:42.679> and<00:05:43.699> here<00:05:44.699> and<00:05:44.729> there<00:05:46.459> it's<00:05:47.459> a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
showing here and here and there it's a

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.339 
showing here and here and there it's a
nice<00:05:47.729> easy<00:05:47.969> transformation<00:05:48.419> I<00:05:48.719> mean<00:05:48.839> I<00:05:48.869> would

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
nice easy transformation I mean I would

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.379 
nice easy transformation I mean I would
even<00:05:49.469> recommend<00:05:49.829> it<00:05:50.039> for<00:05:50.189> a<00:05:50.249> younger<00:05:50.489> kid<00:05:50.819> well

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
even recommend it for a younger kid well

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.850 
even recommend it for a younger kid well
if<00:05:51.569> you<00:05:51.689> want<00:05:51.839> to<00:05:51.929> get<00:05:51.990> your<00:05:52.139> go<00:05:52.559> kid<00:05:52.740> in

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
if you want to get your go kid in

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.279 
if you want to get your go kid in
transformers<00:05:53.490> or<00:05:53.669> have<00:05:54.419> an<00:05:54.539> interest<00:05:54.839> of

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
transformers or have an interest of

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.339 
transformers or have an interest of
getting<00:05:55.559> them<00:05:55.860> into<00:05:56.069> transformers<00:05:56.669> then<00:05:57.349> this

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
getting them into transformers then this

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.899 
getting them into transformers then this
might<00:05:58.529> be<00:05:58.679> the<00:05:58.800> way<00:05:58.919> to<00:05:58.949> go<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.249> start<00:05:59.639> out<00:05:59.759> with

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
might be the way to go to start out with

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.709 
might be the way to go to start out with
a<00:05:59.969> cybertron<00:06:00.479> line<00:06:01.099> so<00:06:02.099> but<00:06:02.939> you<00:06:03.119> know<00:06:03.149> it's

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
a cybertron line so but you know it's

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.529 
a cybertron line so but you know it's
it's<00:06:04.579> sometimes<00:06:05.579> it's<00:06:05.639> refreshing<00:06:05.999> to<00:06:06.269> have<00:06:07.429> a

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
it's sometimes it's refreshing to have a

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.909 
it's sometimes it's refreshing to have a
simple<00:06:09.539> transformation<00:06:10.229> you<00:06:10.349> know<00:06:10.439> sometimes

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
simple transformation you know sometimes

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.129 
simple transformation you know sometimes
the<00:06:11.369> revenge<00:06:12.179> of<00:06:12.269> the<00:06:12.329> Fallen<00:06:12.689> gets<00:06:12.929> too

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
the revenge of the Fallen gets too

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.359 
the revenge of the Fallen gets too
complicated<00:06:13.289> sometimes<00:06:13.919> it's<00:06:14.279> more

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:14.369 
complicated sometimes it's more

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:15.859 
complicated sometimes it's more
complicated<00:06:14.849> and<00:06:15.179> needs<00:06:15.360> to<00:06:15.449> be<00:06:15.539> a<00:06:15.569> team<00:06:15.719> stuff

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:15.869 
complicated and needs to be a team stuff

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:18.199 
complicated and needs to be a team stuff
seems<00:06:16.079> like<00:06:16.199> some<00:06:16.349> time<00:06:17.029> let's<00:06:18.029> go<00:06:18.119> to

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:18.209 
seems like some time let's go to

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:20.419 
seems like some time let's go to
articulation<00:06:19.249> because<00:06:20.249> of<00:06:20.369> the

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:20.429 
articulation because of the

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:21.709 
articulation because of the
transformation<00:06:20.610> has<00:06:21.059> articulation<00:06:21.599> like

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
transformation has articulation like

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.279 
transformation has articulation like
that<00:06:21.899> and<00:06:22.169> like<00:06:22.889> that<00:06:23.179> and<00:06:24.179> you<00:06:24.419> can<00:06:24.569> bend<00:06:24.929> a

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
that and like that and you can bend a

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.619 
that and like that and you can bend a
little<00:06:25.409> bit<00:06:25.740> at<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:25.829> elbow<00:06:26.159> not<00:06:26.519> so<00:06:26.639> much<00:06:26.819> but

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
little bit at the elbow not so much but

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.179 
little bit at the elbow not so much but
you<00:06:27.839> can<00:06:27.990> rotate<00:06:28.949> it<00:06:29.099> around<00:06:29.959> there<00:06:30.959> is<00:06:31.189> no

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.189 
you can rotate it around there is no

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.109 
you can rotate it around there is no
waste<00:06:32.399> articulation<00:06:33.179> to<00:06:33.329> speak<00:06:33.539> of<00:06:34.069> legs

00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:35.119 
waste articulation to speak of legs

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.609 
waste articulation to speak of legs
forward<00:06:36.119> and<00:06:36.599> not<00:06:36.899> really<00:06:37.050> back<00:06:37.289> so<00:06:37.499> much

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:37.619 
forward and not really back so much

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:40.129 
forward and not really back so much
because<00:06:37.829> you're<00:06:37.860> being<00:06:38.039> blocked<00:06:38.309> by<00:06:38.459> that<00:06:39.139> but

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
because you're being blocked by that but

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.409 
because you're being blocked by that but
legs<00:06:40.469> can<00:06:40.649> go<00:06:40.769> side<00:06:41.099> a<00:06:41.129> little<00:06:41.399> bit<00:06:41.519> they're<00:06:42.149> on

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
legs can go side a little bit they're on

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.029 
legs can go side a little bit they're on
a<00:06:42.800> ball-joint<00:06:43.800> there<00:06:44.929> couldn't<00:06:45.929> end<00:06:46.169> that's

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
a ball-joint there couldn't end that's

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.169 
a ball-joint there couldn't end that's
also<00:06:47.309> due<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.579> the<00:06:48.360> transformation<00:06:49.999> so<00:06:50.999> there

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:51.179 
also due to the transformation so there

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:55.939 
also due to the transformation so there
that's<00:06:51.539> a<00:06:51.839> basic<00:06:52.529> articulation<00:06:54.829> mostly<00:06:55.829> in

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
that's a basic articulation mostly in

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.100 
that's a basic articulation mostly in
the<00:06:56.009> shoulders<00:06:56.369> you<00:06:56.490> got<00:06:56.639> the<00:06:56.759> quite<00:06:57.689> a<00:06:57.719> good

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
the shoulders you got the quite a good

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.650 
the shoulders you got the quite a good
range<00:06:58.319> of<00:06:58.409> movement

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
range of movement

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.050 
range of movement
uh<00:06:59.830> so<00:07:00.830> now<00:07:00.980> I<00:07:01.010> can<00:07:01.130> see<00:07:01.370> we're<00:07:01.550> at<00:07:01.670> about<00:07:01.760> eight

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
uh so now I can see we're at about eight

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.430 
uh so now I can see we're at about eight
minutes<00:07:02.270> in<00:07:02.540> half<00:07:02.780> eight<00:07:03.050> and<00:07:03.140> a<00:07:03.200> half<00:07:03.230> minutes

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
minutes in half eight and a half minutes

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.980 
minutes in half eight and a half minutes
into<00:07:04.280> the<00:07:04.370> video<00:07:04.510> but<00:07:05.510> hopefully<00:07:05.750> by<00:07:05.870> the<00:07:05.930> time

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
into the video but hopefully by the time

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.850 
into the video but hopefully by the time
this<00:07:06.320> video<00:07:06.470> is<00:07:06.770> has<00:07:07.040> been<00:07:07.070> spliced<00:07:07.820> and<00:07:08.150> diced

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
this video is has been spliced and diced

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.850 
this video is has been spliced and diced
you're<00:07:09.860> going<00:07:09.980> to<00:07:10.040> be<00:07:10.130> only<00:07:10.310> seeing<00:07:10.610> you<00:07:11.570> know

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
you're going to be only seeing you know

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.130 
you're going to be only seeing you know
three<00:07:12.860> four<00:07:13.190> or<00:07:13.280> five<00:07:13.430> minutes<00:07:13.730> of<00:07:13.820> it<00:07:13.940> so<00:07:14.140> okay

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.140 
three four or five minutes of it so okay

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.880 
three four or five minutes of it so okay
so<00:07:15.200> this<00:07:15.710> concludes<00:07:16.100> my<00:07:16.520> review<00:07:17.180> of

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
so this concludes my review of

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.980 
so this concludes my review of

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.200 
transformers cybertron hotshot i do
recommend<00:07:21.380> you<00:07:21.710> pick<00:07:21.830> them<00:07:21.950> up<00:07:22.130> my<00:07:22.910> CT

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
recommend you pick them up my CT

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.260 
recommend you pick them up my CT
transformation<00:07:23.840> even<00:07:24.620> if<00:07:25.190> you're<00:07:25.430> you're

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
transformation even if you're you're

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.940 
transformation even if you're you're
you're<00:07:26.600> more<00:07:26.810> into<00:07:27.110> revenge<00:07:27.410> of<00:07:27.500> the<00:07:27.560> Fallen

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:27.950 
you're more into revenge of the Fallen

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.910 
you're more into revenge of the Fallen
or<00:07:28.130> some<00:07:28.520> some<00:07:28.790> more<00:07:28.910> complex<00:07:29.420> transfer

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:29.920 
or some some more complex transfer

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.290 
or some some more complex transfer
transformers<00:07:30.920> still<00:07:31.790> would<00:07:31.910> recommend

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
transformers still would recommend

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.670 
transformers still would recommend
picking<00:07:32.390> the<00:07:32.600> stuff<00:07:32.660> is<00:07:32.840> every<00:07:33.020> once<00:07:33.530> in<00:07:33.650> a

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
picking the stuff is every once in a

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.740 
picking the stuff is every once in a
while<00:07:33.830> it's<00:07:34.040> nice<00:07:34.160> to<00:07:34.340> have<00:07:34.460> a<00:07:34.660> figure<00:07:35.660> that's

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750 
while it's nice to have a figure that's

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.060 
while it's nice to have a figure that's
easy<00:07:35.960> transform<00:07:36.440> and<00:07:36.800> it<00:07:37.370> looks<00:07:38.120> well<00:07:38.300> so<00:07:39.070> okay

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070 
easy transform and it looks well so okay

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.110 
easy transform and it looks well so okay
guys<00:07:40.220> catch<00:07:41.120> you<00:07:41.330> later<00:07:41.360> bye
