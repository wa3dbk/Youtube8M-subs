I can see here and the setup is simple
of<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.799> look<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> back<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> guitar

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
of a look here at the back of the guitar

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
of a look here at the back of the guitar
there's<00:01:24.330> three<00:01:24.960> spring<00:01:25.320> use<00:01:25.530> strings<00:01:26.159> used

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
there's three spring use strings used

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.410 
there's three spring use strings used
here<00:01:26.939> at<00:01:27.119> ends<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.789> ends<00:01:30.000> work<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
here at ends and so it ends work for the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
here at ends and so it ends work for the
reason<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:30.869> you've<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.049> Elevens<00:01:31.710> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
reason is if you've got Elevens we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.889 
reason is if you've got Elevens we
probably<00:01:32.280> recommend<00:01:32.610> having<00:01:32.939> four<00:01:33.450> Springs

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and the plate is floating slightly so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160 
and the plate is floating slightly so
you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.830> as<00:01:38.549> well<00:01:38.610> as<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.539> which<00:01:39.929> with
