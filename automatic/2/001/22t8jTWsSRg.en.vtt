00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.510
 change the display on galaxy yong 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.310
 we are in a rush because it's minus on the street 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:41.899
 the fight is worth 288 in my opinion at the moment 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:02.460
 go away please have a video here 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:05.460
 writes owls battles their discusses the flash drive 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.560
 if worth not forget to extract to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:16.950
 don't break 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:23.150
 nest he apparently no one has climbed before 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 this is why everything is pretty tight 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:02:14.750
 stitch here the antenna contacts in general then 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:19.190
 nothing more plastic buttons 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:26.380
 Only there we snap off the fastener of the display 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.380
 and raise 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.700
 bolts 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:59.760
 The dress is not here either. 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:03:02.260
 necessarily connected initially 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.880
 Framed display tested until 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 removed the film from him 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.380
 yes everyone saw the whole 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.090
 when we do like this with him disconnect 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:33.690
 we postpone the fee so as not to interfere 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:39.280
 display tip on glue sometimes 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:41.460
 slight difficulties arise raise 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.460
 him 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.840
 we are the main task now 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 so that I got caught cleaning it up 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.370
 quite difficult then 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.980
 need to touch can not touch 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.980
 remove the protective film 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:37.930
 already the best in this state to me 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:42.210
 horrible and we put in place so pushed aside 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.210
 the fee was rolled back into place
