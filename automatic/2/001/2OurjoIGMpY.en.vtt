into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> states<00:01:28.500> turns<00:01:29.069> out<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.580> are

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
into the states turns out we are

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.969 
into the states turns out we are
probably<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:30.780> first<00:01:31.050> dealership<00:01:31.530> in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
probably about the first dealership in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.130 
probably about the first dealership in
the<00:01:32.039> United<00:01:32.399> States<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:33.000> carry<00:01:33.300> him<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.020> know

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the United States to carry him you know

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:47.040 
the United States to carry him you know
Milwaukee<00:01:34.590> embraced<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:36.119> mad<00:01:36.330> ass

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.930 

I<00:01:47.140> think<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.830> price<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.190> gas<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.340> kind<00:01:48.850> of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
I think the price of gas just kind of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.600 
I think the price of gas just kind of
made<00:01:49.810> people<00:01:49.960> think<00:01:50.110> twice<00:01:50.530> about<00:01:50.560> how<00:01:51.460> they

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
made people think twice about how they

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.320 
made people think twice about how they
get<00:01:51.730> around<00:01:51.820> what<00:01:52.390> they<00:01:52.540> ride<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.270> think

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
get around what they ride and I think

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.110 
get around what they ride and I think
probably<00:01:55.840> half<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.290> customers<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.880> I've

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
probably half the customers that I've

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.330 
probably half the customers that I've
dealt<00:01:58.420> with<00:01:58.510> personally<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.800> was<00:02:00.040> a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
dealt with personally that was a

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.640 
dealt with personally that was a
decisive<00:02:00.910> factor<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:01.750> them<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.230> actually

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
decisive factor for them and actually

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.400 
decisive factor for them and actually
buying<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.190> they<00:02:04.150> come<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.420> once<00:02:04.750> or<00:02:04.930> twice<00:02:05.020> and

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
buying it they come in once or twice and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.930 
buying it they come in once or twice and
think<00:02:05.620> about<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.070> then<00:02:06.190> when<00:02:06.460> gas<00:02:06.670> would

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
think about it and then when gas would

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.870 
think about it and then when gas would
go<00:02:07.030> up<00:02:07.150> another<00:02:07.360> dollar<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:09.220> know<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.369> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
go up another dollar in you know in the
