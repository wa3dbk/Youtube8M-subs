00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.520
 hi do the little goalie is therefore 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.560
 today banconi see I'm not 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 your a pc or in front of an easy corn screen 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.660
 weird we agree 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.019
 in fact it is to show you my 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:37.000
 last little DIY based on arn we 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:39.879
 know is actually it's one and no more 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.050
 less as you can less than one 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.940
 small weather station 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.879
 so how am I going to proceed from onkyo 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.760
 on this phase you see we actually 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:55.510
 a 20 screen by four lcd with just to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 left the potty late to adjust the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.780
 contrast 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.410
 on a next class here we have a 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.460
 pressure and temperature sensor 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.430
 it's a bpa of 0.85 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 here we have a photo resistance for the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.370
 amount of light and there it is a dhd 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.940
 were bought by a thousand excuses - 22 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:30.610
 for another temperature sensor is 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 also a last moisture sensor so 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.380
 I'm not paying attention to the cab will not be 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.600
 went behind here we got what he told us 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.510
 actually serves as a clock so it's a ds 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.750
 1307 knows more about how one also has a 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.130
 push button that I recovered in 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.210
 does the push button serves us 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.580
 only see I put small 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.320
 Led history whether jailers 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.110
 blow strongest button makes for 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.110
 only used to turn on and off 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.110
 Gainey 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:15.150
 and of course in the little box we 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:22.019
 got all of that I just ask 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 like that a little bit we have and ben 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:29.180
 necessarily all the cables to connect 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 to the ruin to I have little flat on the side 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 I did a postponement of the usb plug 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.340
 because I will never be able to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.629
 connect my art dino on this hold 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.180
 uation its usb socket 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.670
 so I made a small report with a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.010
 usb cable or here you have 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.069
 the main switch with a small 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.739
 sugar and a jack that goes 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.430
 directly in fact on a catch of 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.700
 current located below the power supply 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.230
 m fate of 12 volts in 2 years loses that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.989
 an old 20-disc power supply 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.090
 hard western digital that I have to burn and 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.049
 and then here you go 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.060
 weather situation is very nice 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:16.099
 it's especially super pretty and then ben 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 especially it's you who did it and 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.680
 it's because a lot less 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.700
 expensive than the year weather station we 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.329
 can see in the trade 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.430
 so that's the company the little video of 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.530
 presentation to show you that the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.669
 final render 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.109
 I do it like that now you 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.989
 can change boxes will give you back 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.010
 a small bigger display finally I 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.209
 actually wanted it's an art of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.470
 velodrome what do you want to kill 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.320
 so 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.100
 what am I going to do if you want 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.250
 will reproduce doing the same thing at 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.380
 you on the site anderson 68 13 points 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.750
 as know how to find them an article or of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.780
 donations there will be the assembly diagram the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.910
 code for the street gounod the different 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.030
 links to the small modules that I have 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.240
 purchased from bought 22 the ds 1307 for 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.620

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.530
 low and patience to build and 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.269
 do the same thing at here go 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.780
