making contact with the socket that I

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
making contact with the socket that I
showed<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.420> earlier<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.530> go<00:02:27.950> ahead<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.250> get

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
showed you earlier so go ahead and get

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.860 
showed you earlier so go ahead and get
it<00:02:28.430> nice<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:28.910> parallel<00:02:29.240> with<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.600> heads

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
it nice and parallel with the heads

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.860 
it nice and parallel with the heads
don't<00:02:30.740> try<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.190> compress<00:02:31.700> these<00:02:31.970> Springs<00:02:32.450> with

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
don't try to compress these Springs with

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.750 
don't try to compress these Springs with
the<00:02:33.080> compressor<00:02:33.770> sitting<00:02:34.160> haircut

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the compressor sitting haircut

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.180 
the compressor sitting haircut
perpendicular<00:02:35.420> with<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.720> heads<00:02:35.950> when<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:36.980> do

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
perpendicular with the heads when you do

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.340 
perpendicular with the heads when you do
this<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.030> part<00:02:38.330> actually<00:02:38.540> starts<00:02:39.050> closing

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
this this part actually starts closing

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.230 
this this part actually starts closing
in<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.950> getting<00:02:40.100> closer<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:40.760> surface

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
in and getting closer to this surface

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.330 
in and getting closer to this surface
where<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.450> valve<00:02:41.840> cover<00:02:42.110> sits<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.890> if

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
where the valve cover sits on and if

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.770 
where the valve cover sits on and if
you're<00:02:43.460> not<00:02:43.550> careful<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.270> can<00:02:44.510> actually

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
you're not careful you can actually

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.230 
you're not careful you can actually
damage<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.350> surface<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.640> always<00:02:46.970> want<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
damage the surface so you always want to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.910 
damage the surface so you always want to
make<00:02:47.330> sure<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.690> sitting<00:02:48.020> parallel<00:02:48.680> with<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
make sure it's sitting parallel with the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.730 
make sure it's sitting parallel with the
the<00:02:49.400> heads<00:02:49.870> get<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:50.930> nice<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.140> squared<00:02:51.590> up

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
the heads get it nice and squared up

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.800 
the heads get it nice and squared up
with<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> valve<00:02:52.270> next<00:02:53.270> thing<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.510> want<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.690> do

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
with the valve next thing you want to do

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.180 
with the valve next thing you want to do
is<00:02:53.930> grab<00:02:54.050> that<00:02:54.290> sock<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.740> I<00:02:54.800> showed<00:02:55.010> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.340 
retainer mat and have the other side of
the<00:02:59.960> compressor<00:03:00.670> sitting<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.180> socket

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.750 

okay<00:03:06.350> next<00:03:06.830> thing<00:03:07.040> we'll<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.280> doing<00:03:07.340> here<00:03:07.700> is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
okay next thing we'll be doing here is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.620 
okay next thing we'll be doing here is
we're<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.030> be<00:03:08.120> compressing<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
we're going to be compressing the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.040 
we're going to be compressing the
springs<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.710> go<00:03:09.980> ahead<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.250> take<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
springs so go ahead and take the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.240 
springs so go ahead and take the
compressor<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.260> start<00:03:12.620> compressing<00:03:12.950> those

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
compressor and start compressing those

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.560 
compressor and start compressing those
Springs<00:03:13.640> you're<00:03:13.910> going<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.090> hear<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.239> series<00:03:14.540> of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
Springs you're going to hear a series of

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.940 
Springs you're going to hear a series of
clicks<00:03:14.989> as<00:03:15.520> each<00:03:16.520> time<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.270> compress<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.989> so

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
clicks as each time you compress it so

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.210 
clicks as each time you compress it so
that<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.340> compressor<00:03:19.760> locks<00:03:21.220> there's

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
that the compressor locks there's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.820 
that the compressor locks there's
another<00:03:22.520> one<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.080> want<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.350> keep<00:03:24.440> doing

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
another one and you want to keep doing

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.280 
another one and you want to keep doing
until<00:03:24.980> those<00:03:25.640> retainers<00:03:26.480> either<00:03:26.630> fall<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.140> or

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
until those retainers either fall out or

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.750 
until those retainers either fall out or
you<00:03:27.530> feel<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:28.010> you've<00:03:28.130> taken<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
you feel that you've taken all the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.240 
you feel that you've taken all the
pressure<00:03:29.030> off<00:03:29.180> those<00:03:30.050> keepers<00:03:30.500> once<00:03:31.070> you've

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
pressure off those keepers once you've

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.220 
pressure off those keepers once you've
done<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.700> take<00:03:32.060> magnet<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.540> showed<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.989> and
