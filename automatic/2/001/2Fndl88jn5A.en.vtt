00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.120 
we've got somewhat connect sports
gameplay<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.960> it's<00:00:07.379> actually<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:07.919> golf

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
gameplay and it's actually some golf

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.129 
gameplay and it's actually some golf
which<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.940> fourth<00:00:09.269> sport<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> game

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
which is the fourth sport on the game

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.980 
which is the fourth sport on the game
and<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.269> actually<00:00:12.420> plays<00:00:12.719> pretty

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and this this one actually plays pretty

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.160 
and this this one actually plays pretty
well<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.230> well<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.849> motion<00:00:15.630> which<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.839> swing

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
well as well the motion which you swing

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
well as well the motion which you swing
seems<00:00:17.039> relatively<00:00:19.160> good<00:00:20.160> compared<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
seems relatively good compared to a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.840 
seems relatively good compared to a
true-life<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.630> obviously<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.310> angle<00:00:23.670> which

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
true-life is obviously the angle which

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.400 
true-life is obviously the angle which
is<00:00:23.880> shoot<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.539> all<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.050> really

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
is shoot and all that it's not really

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.390 
is shoot and all that it's not really
there<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:27.269> gist<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:28.369> what<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
there but the gist of it is there what I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.540 
there but the gist of it is there what I
like<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.949> voice<00:00:31.949> controls

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like on this one is the voice controls

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.810 
like on this one is the voice controls
where<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> change<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.210> club<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.010> oh<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
where you change a club and oh and you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
where you change a club and oh and you
can<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.530> thing<00:00:37.530> where<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> stand

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
can also do a thing where if you stand

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
can also do a thing where if you stand
up<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.430> new<00:00:38.640> obviously<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.629> stand<00:00:39.870> up<00:00:40.079> if

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
up and new obviously you stand up if

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630 
up and new obviously you stand up if
you're<00:00:40.290> playing<00:00:40.440> Kinect<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.280> stand<00:00:41.520> up

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you're playing Kinect but you stand up

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
you're playing Kinect but you stand up
and<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:41.940> hand<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.170> your

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and put your hand like just with your

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.229 
and put your hand like just with your
eyebrows<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.640> you're<00:00:44.760> looking<00:00:44.940> into<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
eyebrows like you're looking into the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
eyebrows like you're looking into the
distance<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.840> will<00:00:45.960> show<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> shade

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
distance it will show you that you shade

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.340 
distance it will show you that you shade
them<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> golf<00:00:48.750> course<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
them up of the golf course which is I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.549 
them up of the golf course which is I
think<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.649> pretty<00:00:49.800> decent

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
think it's pretty decent

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.709 
think it's pretty decent
so<00:00:52.559> yeah<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.280> I've<00:00:54.120> donated<00:00:54.329> how<00:00:54.539> many

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so yeah I think I've donated how many

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.119 
so yeah I think I've donated how many
hosts<00:00:55.170> I've<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.680> video<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> think

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hosts I've got in this video I think

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.880 
hosts I've got in this video I think
it's<00:00:56.250> by<00:00:56.370> free<00:00:57.140> doesn't<00:00:58.140> sound<00:00:58.379> too<00:00:58.500> good<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's by free doesn't sound too good but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's by free doesn't sound too good but
yeah<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:01.289> thing<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.530> free<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:02.039> think

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
yeah I think the thing is free I'm think

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.650 
yeah I think the thing is free I'm think
I'll<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.699> birdie<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> although<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.510> not

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
I'll get birdie and although I'm not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
I'll get birdie and although I'm not
sure<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:05.040> thing<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.760> easy<00:01:05.880> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
sure that's one thing is really easy I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
sure that's one thing is really easy I
was<00:01:06.180> playing<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.750> rookie<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.590> gonna<00:01:07.740> lie

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

but<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.659> can't<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.900> getting<00:01:10.200> much<00:01:10.350> harder

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
but I can't see it getting much harder

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850 
but I can't see it getting much harder
but<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.400> might<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> yeah<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
but it might do so so yeah this is a

a white lion towards the hole and you've

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
a white lion towards the hole and you've
got<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> line<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.619> thick<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
got to make that line as like thick as

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460 
got to make that line as like thick as
possible<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> means<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.320> more

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
possible and then that means but more

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.069 
possible and then that means but more
times<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.549> by<00:01:47.670> moving

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
times of going in you do that by moving

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.660 
times of going in you do that by moving
