00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.200
 heil hello everyone welcome for 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750
 a new video on call of duty 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.990
 new warfarin says new ndÃ¨ye 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.389
 coumba the high tech I found 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.889
 longer laps high tech loopholes well 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 heard so the elite version which is I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 think the best policy that exists 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.199
 in my opinion since it is clear that there 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.910
 it is there the big advantage of not 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.140
 see disadvantage unfairly so 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.490
 it's true even what is clearly the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 good at the class level that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 I use I do not remember exactly 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.560
 so it must be a class with me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 wonder if I had put the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 handle how is it called lapland 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 pins I do not really know anymore but I 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.820
 am I remember I had to put 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 lacrosse and I had to put the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.910
 silent besides that I do not put 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.230
 never usually the silent but there 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 I told myself about this part that we have 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.379
 the cheekbones the muffler we'll see 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.489
 what will it give if I find it ok 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.140
 give something good and you 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 go see that this part is going to be 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.590
 rather rather among other good we are going 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.989
 say that like that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
 so that's so yes so I do not play 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.320
 more many adventures do to no 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 not say more at all now 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 does not prevent me from posting you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.210
 videos from time to time but 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.059
 it is true that well how to say the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 parties are crazy already rare not only 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.720
 because of the matchmaking but already because of 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.310
 the number of players I think 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.390
 driven the other actually in my opinion the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.470
 that they have the match but who 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.939
 people find less and less less 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.530
 two parts fool that precisely the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.330
 so people leave that it does not arrange 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 necessarily things but good short that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.729
 it's not a big deal 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 anyway the game as it is like 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.400
 I told you in my last video 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.990
 advanced warfare it's not really my 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.490
 trip the lag a bit too high 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.630
 finally movements are too fast 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 for the lag so it's a little bit 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.509
 it's a little hot blow I 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.009
 prefer I prefer to go on others 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.240
 games quietly there while waiting I 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.700
 have just started a little witcher 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 3 acquired but frankly sympathetic to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.560
 the eye and that's pretty cool so I 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.210
 do not know how long it will last 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.180
 single player but it's true that he is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.409
 Really long but short 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 in any case it's really a very good 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.829
 game if you have not already tried it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.750
 you really recommend it and that's it 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.800
 so if not then what can I 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.020
 tell you else today 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.700
 the beta of black ops 3 that will arrive the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 next week I think we're going 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 to be served at the level of the videos of 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.560
 youtube hours ps4 that's going to be a 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.300
 very very good thing 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.550
 we will be able to start making a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.440
 little notice and the level of the beta me 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.150
 I'm waiting any case it's clear I'm waiting 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.170
 the output on pc because that's 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.369
 really there that I will be able to you 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.960
 make videos so I know there is 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.860
 a lot of people who tell me they're me 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.260
 ask if I 'm going to make videos 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.640
 on the beta of mac os 3 i'm youtuber 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.200
 call of duty if I do not do any video on 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.940
 the beta of mac os 3 is maybe a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.020
 worry somewhere still no but 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.460
 yes of course I want to make videos 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.570
 on the black beta men be of course 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.950
 I will not start I may not have 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.720
 focus on kf3 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.920
 during the beta but I think I 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 will you do some videos when 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.760
 even on the petanque if only at the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 less maybe a little live of 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.290
 early discovery and kind for example 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.370
 the week-end weekend of the beta I 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.570
 may be judge claude rey 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.490
 maybe a little live discovery 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.810
 quickly story of having my 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 live reactions on the first 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.820
 parts 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.200
 and then after that I will surely make 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.580
 a little more classic gameplay 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.230
 we will say with comments and 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.470
 especially on the pc version on the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 version on down mostly about 1 that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.710
 this is on the pc version on the game in 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.270
 General I know I have not yet 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.410
 talked about the specialists on black ops 3 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.200
 in none of my videos any 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.820
 just because I do not really 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.230
 my opinion on it for the moment my 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.730
 opinion is not really still frozen because 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.380
 that for the moment what is happening is 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.520
 that low specialists is a little 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.020
 like the nightfall titans except that 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.340
 yes basically that's it's everyone 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.690
 wants the road necessarily everyone 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.070
 going to see his specialist during the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.630
 part 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.890
 the question is what is that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.210
 is really going to be full bullshit or 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.710
 will it really stay pretty 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.150
 soft since from what I see 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.640
 it's still stuff you one shot 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.690
 a little bit everyone it's like that it's me 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.000
 look a little bit of people at wholesale 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.500
 still the ease you see that I 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.750
 the impression that it's still that re 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.490
 becomes even easier as if 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.230
 it was not enough like that 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.520
 and suddenly we will meet again 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.830
 with things that one shot 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.870
 completely unfair if I have to say 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.910
 because it's true that even someone 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.230
 which is 1 0 20 for example bah yes 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.430
 for sure he will succeed in seeing his 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.900
 specialist and then he'll be able to do 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.120
 maybe five or six he's with that's 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.170
 well it's good for him but 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.060
 it's still not it's still 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.710
 not very fair in the end since it's 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.330
 still that supposed to be a reward 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.500
 that you have the specialist then you 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.520
 go tell me yes but whoever does 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 full of it is good to have several 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.160
 in the western part and on bland 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.450
 crowd crowd it was a bit the same 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.130
 that's not to say that 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.240
 titans were completely smoked 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.650
 certainly you could me a pussy with 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.780
 the titans but what I mean 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.730
 it was not at all it's not 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.380
 the same is happening the psychology of 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.700
 game actually title it's not at all 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.959
 even 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.940
 I do not even know how to describe it in 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.500
 done it's not at all the same thing and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.540
 that makes the titans really not 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.430
 at all abused in crazy stride then 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.510
 that in my opinion the gender specialists 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.920
 when we see for example then 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.280
 maybe not even the one who comes back in 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 back 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.640
 this one frankly everybody has 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.570
 the air of hallucinating on it while 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.400
 it's the one that makes me less afraid 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.180
 personally whoever does the most 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.120
 afraid I think it's called 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.260
 the animator whoever has what 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.690
 this one I think it's the one who has 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 the gun that one shot cross of maps 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.080
 different shot he kills 5 but that at the same time 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.490
 time we do something a little weird this 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.690
 there I'm waiting to see what's up 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.920
 give but I have the impression that 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.020
 a lot of people will play with 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.280
 this one and it's not going to be a part of 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.840
 pleasure to play against them because at 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.070
 my opinion I role at the beginning of the game 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.330
 it'll be okay then when you go 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.860
 get to half of the party at all 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.290
 the world that will see exactly the same 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.640
 specialist that's going to make hello that 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.830
 guns who want pussy everywhere I 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.780
 wonder if it's a good idea I'm 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.370
 raises a little question after your 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.980
 the stuff like the death machine that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.880
 it's a little bit past 16 days 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.169
 always returns to the same 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.580
 discussion ie in fact there 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.780
 they are adding 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.250
 strict body equivalents 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.570
 I think we agree on that 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.460
 on the fact that it is equivalences 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.960
 strict body 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.190
 without it being strict scores it's 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.600
 to say basically it's going to be it's like 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.220
 strict support scores but with 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.389
 which you can kill for me 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.340
 find with exactly the same thing 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.229
 we had in modern warfare 3 with 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.479
 support killstreaks which are 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.889
 are the talent and that's why I 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.970
 am a little bit chilled 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.190
 for the moment at the level of the coop 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.750
 strauss i do not know if it's really going 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.400
 to be like that in the final version is 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.810
 what that finally after you never know 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.340
 how will the game unfold what is it 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.110
 find it sits it's going very well 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.370
 pass and just as we saw by 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.840
 example in taken times we saw the 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.190
 titans have zhihua damn it's going to be a 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.569
 crazy thing whoever sees the title he 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.889
 will have to fart mouth all the 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.720
 world and everything is not at all 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.099
 the case the titan is completely smooth 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.900
 very completely disassembled a dryer 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.490
 it's super easy to dismantle a titan 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.449
 I wonder if it's going to be a small 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.039
 little the same thing is what the 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.160
 disadvantages of the specialists will be 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.530
 as high as finally as numerous as 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.090
 the benefits I do not know I do not know 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.320
 we'll see during the beta we'll see 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.150
 after during the final game but it's 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.970
 true that for the moment it makes me a 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.530
 just a little bit scared here after good 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.120
 time I have not played the game is a 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.560
 character or the game even though 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.610
 safety the gamescom and company 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.120
 anyway they do not really have their 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.039
 word to say 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.750
 because anyway there were not 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.159
 played long enough clearly they have 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.560
 not played in online conditions 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.669
 with polluting players we will say 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.530
 do not know if I can say that like that 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.849
 like all the big campers 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.349
 was in black ops and it is with them 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.550
 beti shock church do not see you there 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.330
 have people like that before black ops 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.530
 three who will do the same thing 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.210
 sofresa may not be with 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.500
 t-shirts charge they go maybe I 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.449
 know nothing about using specialists 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.710
 had asked 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.360
 with different ways that are going 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.439
 to make sure you're going to fart a cable from a 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.909
 completely new way 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.159
 it's going to be crazy stuff you go 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.629
 see but here we do not know yet 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.830
 for the moment so bah me I'm waiting 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.449
 so I'm waiting to have the beta for me 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.889
 pronounce you had my first 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.080
 impressions there if you want I have you 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.900
 given a little bit of a taste of 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.189
 what I think but it's I'm not 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.050
 set the tuque at all since I even 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.830
 not played yet so it's clear 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.599
 that I am not fixed 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.339
 so we'll see later in 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:02.870
 waiting for the little diana she who does 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:04.729
 fun with the picnic straw 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.740
 take a look role with this little 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.240
 silent that my faith has me rather well 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.229
 helped in this part in general I 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.020
 do not put the silencer because 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.279
 precisely in fact two years ago we 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.449
 wins are two schools actually it's up to 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.529
 to say he's at the silent school 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.729
 because you want to arrive all 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.680
 time behind the enemies and you count 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.509
 on tele placement to complain 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.469
 that he is at the game side but no 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.580
 silent like that I do not need 

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:24.050
 to go get the enemies are going 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.189
 always anyway they will come to 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.240
 me because they will see the point on 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:28.159
 the mini map for permanence 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.419
 I'm a little side I do not put the 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.620
 silent then we'll see what's up 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.849
 give I wait they have 50 enemies 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.649
 which happens to me then I kill them at 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.210
 as you go, but it does not work 

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:36.319
 necessarily all the time I see you 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.009
 it is true that if we sometimes 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.599
 is still good 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.589
 good evening here on this month I will you 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.939
 leave on it I want you 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:41.899
 as usual a good day and the 

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.279
 world goes out and then we meet up again 

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.279
 next time go ciao
