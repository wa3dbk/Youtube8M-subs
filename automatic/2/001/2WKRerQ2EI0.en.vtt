glue add a couple drops to the base of
the<00:02:40.910> piece<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.510> class<00:02:43.360> I'm<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.720> going

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the piece of this class I'm just going

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.960 
the piece of this class I'm just going
to<00:02:45.079> gently<00:02:45.319> move<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.860> back<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.340> fourth<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
to gently move it back to fourth and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.809 
to gently move it back to fourth and
around<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:48.200> make<00:02:48.440> sure<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.860> glue<00:02:49.069> covers<00:02:49.579> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
around to make sure the glue covers the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.740 
around to make sure the glue covers the
whole<00:02:49.849> surface<00:02:50.329> area<00:02:50.870> inside<00:02:52.390> next<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.510> can

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
whole surface area inside next I can

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.559 
whole surface area inside next I can
take<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.140> ends<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.890> feed<00:02:55.579> them<00:02:55.849> into<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
take the ends and feed them into the

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.580 
take the ends and feed them into the
class<00:02:57.380> piece<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.790> also<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.450> snug<00:02:59.900> fit<00:02:59.930> so

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
class piece this is also a snug fit so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.710 
class piece this is also a snug fit so
don't<00:03:00.829> get<00:03:01.069> frustrated<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.299> have<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
little bit of a challenge getting them

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.500 
little bit of a challenge getting them
in<00:03:05.590> again<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.769> have<00:03:06.950> your<00:03:07.190> tools<00:03:07.519> handy<00:03:08.120> if

in again you have your tools handy if

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.280 
in again you have your tools handy if
needed<00:03:09.639> this<00:03:10.639> one<00:03:10.910> was<00:03:11.120> actually<00:03:11.329> not<00:03:11.840> too<00:03:12.260> bad

needed this one was actually not too bad
at<00:03:12.680> all<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:14.269> now<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.750> our<00:03:14.959> ends<00:03:15.470> in<00:03:15.620> there

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
at all so now we have our ends in there

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.680 
at all so now we have our ends in there
I'm<00:03:16.130> going<00:03:16.579> to<00:03:16.730> go<00:03:16.910> ahead<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.329> push<00:03:17.569> them

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
I'm going to go ahead and push them

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.569 
I'm going to go ahead and push them
together<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.410> let<00:03:18.590> them<00:03:18.739> sit<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.310> few

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
together and let them sit for a few

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.729 
together and let them sit for a few
moments<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.690> as<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.079> glue<00:03:21.380> starts<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:22.099> set

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
moments just as that glue starts to set

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.410 
moments just as that glue starts to set
and<00:03:24.739> then<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.069> can<00:03:25.099> go<00:03:25.459> ahead<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.730> set

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
and then I can go ahead and set

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.830 
and then I can go ahead and set
side<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:28.640> other<00:03:28.790> place<00:03:29.060> where<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.660> add<00:03:29.810> a
