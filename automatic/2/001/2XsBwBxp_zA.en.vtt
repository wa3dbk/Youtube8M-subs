00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
to go on right there and then the spring

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.070 
to go on right there and then the spring
goes<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:18.960> there<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.570> on<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.899> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
goes in between there and on the back of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.469 
goes in between there and on the back of
your<00:01:22.170> trigger<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:25.039> goes<00:01:26.039> in<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.579> one

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
your trigger right here goes in here one

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.039 
your trigger right here goes in here one
side<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> other<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.280> goes<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:32.840> metal<00:01:33.840> piece

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
side the other side goes on metal piece

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.810 
side the other side goes on metal piece
right<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:36.330> right<00:01:36.479> here<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.700> kind

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
right here that's right here it was kind

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
right here that's right here it was kind
of<00:01:38.909> hard<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.179> see<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.520> that's<00:01:41.520> where<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> goes

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
of hard to see but that's where it goes

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350 
of hard to see but that's where it goes
that<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> T<00:01:43.619> shape<00:01:43.920> metal<00:01:44.340> piece<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that you see the T shape metal piece it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.690 
that you see the T shape metal piece it
goes<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.959> there<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.039> when<00:01:47.429> you<00:01:47.520> put

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
goes on to there and then when you put

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.279 
goes on to there and then when you put
the<00:01:47.819> spring<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> between<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
the spring on there and in between the

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.740 
the spring on there and in between the
trigger<00:01:49.580> you're<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.819> basically<00:01:51.270> want

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
trigger you're going to basically want

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.539 
trigger you're going to basically want
to<00:01:51.840> keep<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> trigger<00:01:52.709> press<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.459> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to keep the trigger press down so the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
to keep the trigger press down so the
spring<00:01:53.819> it<00:01:53.909> doesn't<00:01:54.240> disappear<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.130> then

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
spring it doesn't disappear and then

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.389 
spring it doesn't disappear and then
you're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> go<00:01:57.350> throw<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.709> shit<00:02:01.399> back

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
you're going to go throw this shit back

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.850 
you're going to go throw this shit back
in<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.289> there<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.799> your

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
in and you have that there for your

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.919 
in and you have that there for your
screws<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.569> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> mess

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
screws back in and then you can mess

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.240 
screws back in and then you can mess
with<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> tension<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.799> everything<00:02:08.130> like

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
with the tension and everything like

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.370 
with the tension and everything like
that<00:02:08.310> ever<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.179> need<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.929> hopefully
