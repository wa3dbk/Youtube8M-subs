00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello the objective of this video is 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.270
 to try to predict what you can 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.919
 expect in the months and years to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.250
 come on the gold and the companies 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.219
 mining 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 now we will take the bg friendly 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.529
 index of mining companies of metals 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 precious we see that we have a nice canal 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 who made support resistance to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 many times and that on the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.070
 last phase we have a whip 6 in four 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.080
 years 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 just a remark the bmi is a clue 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 mining companies 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 so it contains the good ones and the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.800
 bad companies if we trace a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.820
 parallel in canada is the support of the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 market as current so we could 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 to be inferred that the dynamics 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 today is similar to the dynamics 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 in the 70s ie 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.010
 stagflation no unemployment growth 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.859
 high inflation high taxes etc 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.070
 so if the dynamics is the same we see 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.470
 we are not far from the bottom of the canal 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 ie a minimum but we do not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.119
 is not even now we're going to talk 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.010
 risks 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.380
 it's been 12 years every barrel it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.530
 represents a year chasing it's 12 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 years that the gold goes up without stopping what is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.189
 really unusual in any 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.140
 bull market we are also witnessing a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.020
 divergence has recently witnessed 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.490
 also to a divergence between the euro which 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.970
 in the euro and its four climbs and when 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.939
 that a train to drop 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.470
 usually the euro and gold bush at the same 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.850
 time in the same direction it's up to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.229
 to say they both drop by 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 compared to the dollar where they have me all 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.899
 two against the dollar 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.439
 but since a few months it's the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.670
 contrary which is a sign of 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.729
 weakness for the hour if we take the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.290
 bull market of the 70s gold on 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.610
 had a tumble in the middle of the cycle 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.840
 from what I understood it was coming 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.840
 of interest rate increases 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 we see we had a nice canal like 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.360
 since 2001 in the market as current 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.060
 and then we had a settlement is 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:24.730
 today what framed here 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.370
 looks like a subsidence in my opinion 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.400
 can also look like a leg of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.670
 rise like high school for example before 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.190
 go up yes it's before going up or here 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:43.600
 before going up but it may look like 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:45.220
 also a settlement before a correction 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.450
 if he said even if the dynamics is the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:53.950
 same as in the 70s we can 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.830
 fall up to 1200 dollars now 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.190
 we take the bg is put on the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.269
 mining companies during the fall of the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:08.290
 70's he corrected by almost 60 5% 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.819
 here today we have a correction 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.989
 between its maximum and where we are 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.470
 today we have a correction of 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:21.840
 almost 35% so maybe he remains a 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.840
 little more before bouncing 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.359
 so we can imagine that it's going down 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.130
 what so far up to a point here towards 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.019
 the bottom of the channel maybe just a little 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.310
 underneath a little above no can 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.310
 to imagine that it's still falling a little 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.579
 now about velocity 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.850
 monetary and the collapse 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.549
 that we are here, that is, a level that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.959
 has never been seen since 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.959
 and then what for more than 50 years 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.750
 economic activity in the united states 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.140
 but it's valid for all countries 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.489
 Western is going down to 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.489
 extremely low levels 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.519
 economically speaking it's a very 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.519
 bad sign 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.530
 so the risks is what for now 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.440
 there was no significant correction 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.380
 of current over 12 years laure is in the process 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.410
 to lower the euro is going up 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.610
 which is unusual 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.840
 there is a possible increase in 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.580
 interest rate in 2013 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.990
 I know that officially they said 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.640
 that they do not have there will not be 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.410
 increase interest rate etc 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.760
 but hey it's the market that will end up 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.380
 impose the rate increase 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.640
 interest 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.410
 so it's a possible and theater 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.850
 realizes there is also he wants 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.200
 important parameter is that there is 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.000
 no new buyers 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.820
 most buyers are people 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.880
 who bought forgetting since 2001 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.870
 or massively in 2009 2010 2011 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.700
 there are no new buyers who 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.640
 who enters this market most 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.290
 are already invested and are so invested 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.370
 important so it's not people 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.440
 looking to buy the benefits 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.970
 so to have a wave of rising 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.490
 it must have entered the 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.220
 market of a new wave of buyers 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.620
 different buyers 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.020
 and also there is a collapse of the 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.480
 monetary velocity they are really 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.470
 serious 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.790
 so here's this presentation 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.790
 I hope it will be useful
