00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 beautiful all gianlu who I am and proposes 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.130
 this my first video on this new one 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 channel 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 I immediately wanted to start let's say for 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 to introduce myself quickly without too much 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.289
 boring you, I'm calling you matteo I'm from florence 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.939
 and I'm 17 years old 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.420
 this is what we say is the presentation 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.670
 base base and it is net that gathers another 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 tuscany make comments eg the boys 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.500
 unfortunately it is so unfortunately because 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 unfortunately I'm not here because unfortunately 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.379
 It wanted to say immediately start 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 speak therefore of nothing of this new 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 channel 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.270
 me because he knew me first for those 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.410
 few who leave spring and wheel 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.820
 94 49 and I decided nothing to move for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.129
 nothing to do this new channel from 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 my gamertag has also changed 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:05.369
 as you see I have taken hd pvr there are 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.409
 let's say technologized boy in short 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.440
 I put myself back in place with the times 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.550
 let's put it this way and nothing this is a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.850
 a motorbike I propose you a mob dmt 7 nothing 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.760
 of which there is a rule which I do not know 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.370
 how many of you but do not know how 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.050
 almost everyone has taken at least one e 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.930
 It is not so 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.670
 ie it is not so simple but yes with with 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.440
 a little experience can be taken 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.450
 I don't want to stay here anyway to tell me 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.600
 how do you take a bike but more or 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 less and we always say the same things 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.380
 obviously the main factor 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.370
 strategy 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.980
 the specialist bonus that I think is 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.780
 much better, of course, I am not a 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.080
 in fact much better than assault e 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.970
 support because it allows you 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.270
 to have all of them as ex as already 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.950
 you know nothing and 27 equipped fire 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 quick silencer or you can 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.960
 you can also put the loaders 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.130
 in short, it is a good weapon 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.960
 general both from the good distance from the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.420
 long distance a very good one 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.489
 very good damage even if I am not a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
 kind of let's say it 's very close to 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.670
 characteristics of the weapon and above all 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.730
 the features that the game provides 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.590
 because I think that anyway the disease 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.360
 however good results are obtained 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.330
 only through a weapon conquests it goes 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.670
 well then of course there are those weapons 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.070
 that objectively they are really scarce 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 and objectively weapons are strong has us 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.420
 thought to mind its worth using 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.350
 so everyone is so 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.850
 oh well nothing guys I'm not a 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.930
 very great yes since again 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:52.310
 I did about 15 but it's not like I know 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.810
 know and think a lot more people 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.850
 good of me but anyway I enjoy a 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.300
 put these videos a different I hope to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.550
 entertain you and or nothing but by how much 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.340
 missing at the end of the video I'm half an hour 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.750
 speaking yet still with fines 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.150
 I don't know any more about birds 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.910
 April are no longer there but them 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.950
 gianluca community in short but really 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.110
 don't really look at the wall here anymore 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.570
 total here this is the most factor 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.440
 important ass the ass factor 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.460
 the ass factor that I said ass no 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.600
 it's not true 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.180
 it's not true you don't say ass is a factor 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.020
 too important ie what who 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.970
 it is above all useful to give it a world 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:41.270
 oh well anyway I said that there is nothing 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.040
 because the fuck I'm saying what 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.170
 I'm saying 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.640
 oh well here look at this as you do the 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.590
 people but I then say it as a background 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.040
 use the anti-riot shield but 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.450
 what is some weapon is a tumor that 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.500
 I take the classic okay nothing because 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.720
 wanted to add me on xbox live are 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.230
 xxxx as you saw from the intro that you 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.420
 he made my friend and I thank him very much 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.130
 I really like this one then came 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 obviously I have to thank you for that 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.840
 you are already following me from my first 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.920
 video so let's put it so obviously if 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.030
 you want to sign up because it would do a lot 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.570
 please more subscribers or better is you 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.790
 over a couple there is nothing I don't feel like 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.010
 so cut off then we also continue 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.720
 because there is time but I don't know more than about 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.090
 decades I should write a lineup but 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.670
 as I love to improvise I prefer 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.330
 sudden sudden re-improvisation 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.670
 and then another thing 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.140
 rightly there is rightly but that I am 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.700
 saying in my first wine it was ice age 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.890
 they're crazy 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.030
 after having however as you have seen the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.040
 smg 9 of secondary that is used because 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.100
 we will still have those I had not discovered 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.410
 the secondary super ie making 9 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.260
 closed in all classes and as you see 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.540
 in the next mobs I will use but there is only 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.140
 the one for this phase is the only one moves 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.430
 in which I kept the fmc in nine that here me 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.260
 they will give a big hand and often between 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.740
 little because he was able to kill 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.060
 of friends in nine from which my the 27 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.930
 no longer had ammunition I didn't want 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.430
 risking here I was missing three or four 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.890
 in short I had killed was on 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.090
 twenty so you see if the first makes the 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.430
 second is not normal 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.610
 my mom there is that cassala there is that 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.040
 cabinet of which I connect I know close 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.660
 near alpha which is incredible that is it does 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.330
 shit in hand whenever he does on c 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.440
 Here we will give you the nos mark in 12 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.120
 so we are almost at the end I don't know me 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.240
 I would find in more than to say it indeed it is 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.930
 with the one works and nothing but the video 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.120

 support me neither in my next videos 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.020
 I hope the next videos can 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:06.040
 pleasure in short I hope everything in general 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.040
