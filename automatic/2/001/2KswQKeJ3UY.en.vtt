00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
and also the birch tree now let's take a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.140 
and also the birch tree now let's take a
look<00:03:11.100> at<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.459> different<00:03:11.580> types<00:03:11.970> of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
look at all the different types of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.390 
look at all the different types of
pictures<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.260> tetra<00:03:13.680> pak<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.160> once

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
pictures in this tetra pak and once

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.770 
pictures in this tetra pak and once
again<00:03:14.580> they're<00:03:14.880> just<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> normal<00:03:15.570> default

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
again they're just the normal default

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.810 
again they're just the normal default
pictures<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:16.830> nothing's<00:03:17.340> really<00:03:17.550> changed

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
pictures so nothing's really changed

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.640 
pictures so nothing's really changed
there<00:03:18.239> now<00:03:18.750> let's<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:19.050> take<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> look<00:03:19.380> at<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
there now let's go take a look at the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.090 
there now let's go take a look at the
mobs<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:21.360> here's<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> ghast<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.650> i<00:03:22.860> don't

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
mobs so here's the ghast and i don't

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.500 
mobs so here's the ghast and i don't
really<00:03:23.220> know<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.760> has<00:03:23.880> changed<00:03:24.420> because

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
really know if this has changed because

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.060 
really know if this has changed because
i<00:03:24.720> can't<00:03:24.930> really<00:03:25.080> remember<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.500> look<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
i can't really remember the look of the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.949 
i can't really remember the look of the
default<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.550> but<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.480> rest<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
default one but with the rest of the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.080 
default one but with the rest of the
mobs<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.470> haven't<00:03:28.980> actually<00:03:29.190> changed<00:03:29.910> at

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
mobs they haven't actually changed at

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.330 
mobs they haven't actually changed at
all<00:03:30.420> apart<00:03:30.959> from<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.260> snow<00:03:31.470> golem<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.160> that's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
all apart from the snow golem and that's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.710 
all apart from the snow golem and that's
mainly<00:03:32.580> because<00:03:32.700> his<00:03:33.090> head<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.269> made<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.690> of

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
mainly because his head is made out of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.660 
mainly because his head is made out of
the<00:03:33.930> pumpkin<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.830> was<00:03:34.980> obviously<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.400> block

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
the pumpkin that was obviously a block

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.670 
the pumpkin that was obviously a block
which<00:03:35.850> changed<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:36.630> apart<00:03:37.080> from<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.380> they

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
which changed but apart from that they

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.470 
which changed but apart from that they
haven't<00:03:37.830> changed<00:03:38.250> how<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.489> mobs<00:03:38.850> look<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.450> i

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
haven't changed how the mobs look so i

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.289 
haven't changed how the mobs look so i
decided<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.170> leave<00:03:40.440> me<00:03:41.100> reviewing<00:03:41.790> those<00:03:41.940> out

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
decided to leave me reviewing those out

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.509 
decided to leave me reviewing those out
of<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:43.019> now<00:03:43.140> hopefully<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.280> future

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
of this for now hopefully in the future

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.330 
of this for now hopefully in the future
they'll<00:03:45.120> probably<00:03:45.600> update<00:03:45.959> this<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.769> add

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
they'll probably update this and add

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.789 
they'll probably update this and add
textures<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.540> all<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.200> different<00:03:49.650> types

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
textures to all of the different types

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.009 
textures to all of the different types
of<00:03:50.010> mob<00:03:50.280> okay<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.930> would

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
of mob okay so this is what it would

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.460 
of mob okay so this is what it would
look<00:03:52.080> like<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.530> we<00:03:52.560> were<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> nether<00:03:54.470> we've

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
look like if we were in the nether we've

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.670 
look like if we were in the nether we've
the<00:03:55.890> portal<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.640> lava<00:03:57.450> de<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.500> is

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
the portal on the lava de and this is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.110 
the portal on the lava de and this is
why<00:03:58.799> would<00:03:59.100> look<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.400> if<00:03:59.580> we<00:03:59.610> were<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
why would look like if we were in the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.229 
why would look like if we were in the
end<00:04:00.590> if<00:04:01.590> we<00:04:02.010> were<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.370> become<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> case

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
end if we were to become in a case

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.120 
end if we were to become in a case
situation<00:04:03.480> with<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.049> sketch<00:04:04.230> pad<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.920> is

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
situation with the sketch pad this is

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.310 
situation with the sketch pad this is
why<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.489> look<00:04:05.640> like<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:06.239> they<00:04:06.390> are<00:04:06.600> really

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
why would look like so they are really

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.900 
why would look like so they are really
beautiful<00:04:07.530> i<00:04:08.010> love<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.519> idea<00:04:08.850> that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
beautiful i love the idea that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.910 
beautiful i love the idea that
everything's<00:04:09.480> square<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.380> can<00:04:10.560> see<00:04:10.740> why

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
everything's square and I can see why

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.479 
everything's square and I can see why
it's<00:04:11.069> called<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.520> OCD<00:04:12.150> pack

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.729 

everything<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.610> just<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:15.849> clean<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.449> crisp

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
everything is just so clean and crisp

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.680 
everything is just so clean and crisp
but<00:04:17.739> yeah<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.160> isn't<00:04:18.370> for<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.760> OCD<00:04:19.299> texture

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
but yeah this isn't for the OCD texture

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.270 
but yeah this isn't for the OCD texture
pack<00:04:19.870> I'm<00:04:20.109> sorry<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.590> video<00:04:20.709> was<00:04:21.040> quite

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
pack I'm sorry the video was quite

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.370 
pack I'm sorry the video was quite
shocked<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:22.030> guess<00:04:22.479> that's<00:04:22.750> mainly<00:04:23.199> because

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
shocked I guess that's mainly because

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.520 
shocked I guess that's mainly because
they<00:04:24.220> didn't<00:04:24.639> add<00:04:24.820> any<00:04:25.120> different<00:04:25.870> textures

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
they didn't add any different textures

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.590 
they didn't add any different textures
for<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.830> mobs<00:04:27.100> but<00:04:27.580> apart<00:04:28.030> from<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.240> this<00:04:28.449> is

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
for the mobs but apart from that this is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.029 
for the mobs but apart from that this is
what<00:04:28.750> all<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:28.960> blocks<00:04:29.380> are<00:04:29.530> like<00:04:29.710> together

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
what all the blocks are like together

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.920 
what all the blocks are like together
and<00:04:30.340> they<00:04:30.520> look<00:04:30.729> really<00:04:30.940> really<00:04:31.210> nice<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.780> do

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
and they look really really nice I do

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.570 
and they look really really nice I do
like<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.350> set<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.680> back<00:04:32.800> but<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.039> think<00:04:33.340> mark

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
like to set you back but I think mark

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.580 
like to set you back but I think mark
will<00:04:33.729> be<00:04:33.880> added<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.180> it<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.780> i<00:04:35.050> would<00:04:35.350> give<00:04:35.560> this

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
will be added to it so i would give this

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.890 
will be added to it so i would give this
texture<00:04:36.220> pack<00:04:36.430> it's<00:04:36.760> six<00:04:37.060> out<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.360> 10<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
texture pack it's six out of 10 and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.469 
texture pack it's six out of 10 and
that's<00:04:38.440> a<00:04:38.620> six<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.250> i'm<00:04:39.610> being<00:04:39.789> generous<00:04:40.120> sir

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
that's a six and i'm being generous sir

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.420 
that's a six and i'm being generous sir
mainly<00:04:40.960> because<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.500> blocks<00:04:41.770> are<00:04:42.010> brilliant

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
mainly because the blocks are brilliant

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.129 
mainly because the blocks are brilliant
i<00:04:42.520> really<00:04:42.940> really<00:04:43.060> love<00:04:43.389> the<00:04:43.449> idea<00:04:43.900> of<00:04:43.960> this

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
i really really love the idea of this

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.930 
i really really love the idea of this
texture<00:04:44.560> pack<00:04:44.740> but<00:04:45.039> apart<00:04:45.340> from<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.580> there's

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
texture pack but apart from that there's

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.730 
texture pack but apart from that there's
nothing<00:04:46.270> else<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.539> can<00:04:46.600> say<00:04:46.990> about<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.410> as<00:04:47.530> it's

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
nothing else I can say about it as it's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.560 
nothing else I can say about it as it's
not<00:04:47.889> really<00:04:48.190> finished<00:04:48.430> no<00:04:48.820> mobs<00:04:49.150> have<00:04:49.389> been

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
not really finished no mobs have been

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.320 
not really finished no mobs have been
changed<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.560> items<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.490> inventory<00:04:51.940> is

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
changed the items in the inventory is

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.240 
changed the items in the inventory is
still<00:04:52.570> looking<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.990> same<00:04:53.199> but<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.800> do<00:04:53.889> believe

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
still looking the same but I do believe

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.100 
still looking the same but I do believe
if<00:04:54.610> they<00:04:54.789> update<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:55.360> made<00:04:55.630> it<00:04:55.720> all<00:04:55.810> look

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
if they update that made it all look

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.870 
if they update that made it all look
different<00:04:56.169> then<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:56.979> could<00:04:57.160> possibly<00:04:57.340> be<00:04:57.760> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
different then it could possibly be a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.969 
different then it could possibly be a
ten<00:04:58.330> as<00:04:58.539> I<00:04:58.780> really<00:04:59.139> really<00:04:59.350> like<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.650> idea<00:04:59.680> of

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
ten as I really really like the idea of

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.010 
ten as I really really like the idea of
this<00:05:00.190> texture<00:05:00.550> pack<00:05:00.729> so<00:05:01.000> hopefully<00:05:01.690> they

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
this texture pack so hopefully they

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.750 
this texture pack so hopefully they
might<00:05:02.229> decide<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.590> upgrade<00:05:02.889> it<00:05:03.250> with<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.550> next

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
might decide to upgrade it with the next

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.029 
might decide to upgrade it with the next
update<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.300> who<00:05:04.660> knows<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.260> may<00:05:05.500> be<00:05:05.560> reviewing

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
update and who knows I may be reviewing

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.770 
update and who knows I may be reviewing
