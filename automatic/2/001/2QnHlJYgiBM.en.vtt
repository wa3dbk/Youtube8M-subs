blending you're creating harsh lines and
that<00:02:58.040> doesn't<00:02:58.579> look<00:02:58.819> as<00:02:59.030> natural<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.530> now<00:03:00.709> you

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
that doesn't look as natural so now you

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.680 
that doesn't look as natural so now you
can<00:03:00.980> see<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.370> much<00:03:01.609> more<00:03:01.849> smoky<00:03:02.480> and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690
