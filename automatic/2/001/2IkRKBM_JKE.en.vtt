kind of hairstyle is more appropriate
during<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> summer<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> times

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
during the summer because a lot of times

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.220 
during the summer because a lot of times
you<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.649> wet<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> hair<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.550> bunch<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you have to wet the hair a bunch for the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
you have to wet the hair a bunch for the
curls<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.399> popping<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.420> feel<00:00:51.660> like

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
curls so just a popping and I feel like

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
curls so just a popping and I feel like
if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> winter<00:00:52.620> time<00:00:52.920> you're

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
if you do it in the winter time you're

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
if you do it in the winter time you're
going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.579> sick<00:00:53.820> ultimately<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> will

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
going to get sick ultimately that will

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.529 
going to get sick ultimately that will
happen<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.430> definitely<00:00:56.730> been<00:00:57.210> one

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
happen but this has definitely been one

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.380 
happen but this has definitely been one
of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.840> easiest<00:00:58.500> curly<00:00:59.309> styles<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.149> ever

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of the easiest curly styles I have ever

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.170 
of the easiest curly styles I have ever
done<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.030> wet

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
done just because you don't have to wet

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.649 
done just because you don't have to wet
it<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.700> that<00:01:05.700> sets<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.360> being

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it so much and that sets a lot being

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
it so much and that sets a lot being
that<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.200> such<00:01:07.470> long<00:01:07.770> lengths<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.369> let<00:01:08.970> me

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
was like wow this here is too long

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.719 
was like wow this here is too long
because<00:01:14.720> I've<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.530> installs<00:01:17.340> before<00:01:17.880> but

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
because I've had my installs before but

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.950 
because I've had my installs before but
like<00:01:20.780> if<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.320> stretch<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> reaches

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
like if I stretch it out like it reaches

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
like if I stretch it out like it reaches
like<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.140> waist<00:01:26.540> yeah<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.400> 20<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
like my waist yeah so I think it's 20 to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
like my waist yeah so I think it's 20 to
24<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:30.990> curly<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> stream

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
24 when curly so if you were to stream

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
24 when curly so if you were to stream
this<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.180> sure<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:34.409> more

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
this here I'm sure it would be way more

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.160 
this here I'm sure it would be way more
than<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.750> don't<00:01:36.840> know
