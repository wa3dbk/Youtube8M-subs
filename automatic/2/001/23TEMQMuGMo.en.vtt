00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.589
 and bag hanger 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.359
 this is really such a thing that has 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.280
 never saw that you could do such a bark 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.010
 you look so hard but it is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.889
 so really super easy and the one thing 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.199
 you need threads and beads 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.840
 your passion first a piece of wire then go 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.730
 I start wrapping from here 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.080
 12 times around your fingers and make sure you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.080
 fingers well spread 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.660
 you have it again and the worries 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.219
 long is that if i agree that you have left 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 taken into account 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.140
 to ensure that it stays that way 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 do you need a guide wire i need you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 stick through it and then make 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.710
 I have my plan 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.870
 a package 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.289
 then would be 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.480
 everything apart and then you go with this 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:01.379
 turn it outside three times 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 a pretty serene wrap around it too 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.990
 you put him on the back and roy 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.740
 now with all you ask for the other 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 side 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:17.110
 two and three now goes from the other side 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 in there then you get this 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.340
 and for that I am going to hope this goes 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.640
 I cut the guide wire away because that one 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.640
 I don't need it 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.860
 profile but this of course does not seem 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.210
 more like a kind of on the bus and wants 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.289
 a nice bag hanger 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.289
 The cut through the tabs 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.380
 and so that they are nicely in the same party 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.080
 together and cut them off flush 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.920
 when 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 your tassel is the basis though I already go 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.500
 nice story at the top 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.110
 here then all the wires and then it sees 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.210
 look like this 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.150
 it makes me very happy 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.500
 how does it click on the wrist here a fixed one 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.110
 just put on the old key ring and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.790
 purity and most hardened question of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.790
 hang ai bag 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.290
 I look I've also made once 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.360
 without tears at the bottom 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.510
 I hope I inspired you a lot 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.760
 success and looks like that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.390
 look with such an original eye-catching 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.390
 bag hanger
