00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
is still I I just this has been going

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.030 
is still I I just this has been going
around<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.379> just<00:02:37.590> doesn't<00:02:37.889> make<00:02:37.980> any

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
around and it just doesn't make any

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.030 
around and it just doesn't make any
sense<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> me<00:02:38.609> I<00:02:38.700> mean<00:02:38.879> obviously<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.689> think

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
sense to me I mean obviously I think

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.530 
sense to me I mean obviously I think
there's<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.099> little<00:02:41.280> bit<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.489> when<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.329> that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
there's a little bit of when we see that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.319 
there's a little bit of when we see that
that<00:02:43.109> letter<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.609> Batman<00:02:45.090> vs

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
that letter that in the Batman vs

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.149 
that letter that in the Batman vs
Superman<00:02:45.359> trailer<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.859> letter<00:02:47.040> it

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
Superman trailer we see that letter it

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.640 
Superman trailer we see that letter it
says<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.549> let<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.909> family<00:02:48.150> died<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.870> think

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
says you let your family died I think

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.080 
says you let your family died I think
that<00:02:49.680> has<00:02:49.889> maybe<00:02:50.159> something<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.579> do<00:02:50.819> with<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
that has maybe something to do with the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.379 
that has maybe something to do with the
Red<00:02:51.239> Hood<00:02:51.359> story<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.689> just<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.109> think<00:02:52.439> that

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
Red Hood story I just don't think that

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.110 
Red Hood story I just don't think that
the<00:02:54.389> Joker<00:02:54.689> is<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.319> Jason<00:02:56.189> Todd<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.939> just

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the Joker is is Jason Todd it just

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.970 
the Joker is is Jason Todd it just
doesn't<00:02:57.299> really<00:02:57.419> make<00:02:57.659> sense<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.109> me<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.409> don't

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
doesn't really make sense to me I don't

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.229 
doesn't really make sense to me I don't
think<00:02:59.159> they<00:02:59.219> would<00:02:59.340> go<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.879> don't<00:03:00.090> think

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
think they would go that I don't think

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.879 
think they would go that I don't think
they<00:03:00.299> would<00:03:00.389> go<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.689> route<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.169> really<00:03:01.739> don't

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
they would go that route I really don't

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.229
