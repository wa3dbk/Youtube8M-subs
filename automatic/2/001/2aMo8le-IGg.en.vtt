00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.750
 match the nose and the training clothing 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 of the psv selection 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 and after a competition day it is normal 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.800
 find out everything about the competition 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.199
 you will pack again follow the next 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 next game and this morning I have 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 first made the training ready 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.660
 she lies everything lies before the training 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 could have finished training 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.719
 and now I am busy with the competition and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.040
 then tight is just training 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.300
 collect stuff wash and then fold it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 things along for a very, very whole day 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.239
 busy but sweden got enough as was 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.239
 man knows yes of course who really the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.969
 has the greatest sweaty feet at psv 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 sweaty feet the rescue but most 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.440
 sweats though 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.719
 bouma perhaps none so minimal 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.410
 full of fighting which lost lost in the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.170
 contest 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 clash what you say yes yes and whine 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 soaking wet 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.400
 don't know man how much service 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 general through and yes yes you must be hot 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.600
 I think a t-shirt that between the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.729
 all together so both European and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 nationally that is an 800 to 1000 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 Continue with your earlier in a European 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 moze always exchange a shirt then there are 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.159
 so with those two those two things shirts 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.070
 exchange and in the competition and then 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.400
 also the thick pike schÃ¤tzen gold 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.880
 how much the movie do you put them swimming 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.850
 you have competition sets you have 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.750
 meters for the cup rounds you have separate 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.370
 set 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.290
 European you have a separate move and then 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.290
 you have 2 of each set 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.950
 yes say two sets of short sleeves two 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.500
 sets long sleeves and have you out and at home 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.890
 and have you gone for the cup too 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.890
 double and in a tendon also double 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 so yes you have pretty 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.970
 where to keep to around your waist the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.600
 going away match no less than seven 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.430
 crates with clothing and here I have 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.970
 yesterday is actually everything there is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.950
 shampoo in the Ziggo Dome in the sitting 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.650
 captain's tires are in it roo 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 golden bands are covered in blankets 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 cold loops over the legs 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.160
 lay sundresses that they were both 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.300
 need my help to get to the field 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.040
 walk 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.480
 so there we are our math mess 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.920
 junk box 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 so you see where are you really wanting 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.540
 in your opinion 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.489
 nine times and therefore certainly response to it 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.320
 training camp goes offered him to me 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.390
 foreigners if so then all must 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.950
 but it also goes to the same 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.290
 training stuff with it 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.930
 so there you are on your swing 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.959
 master between 900 and 1100 kilos 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.950
 dress then go there with something 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.630
 easy you work nice i think more it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.750
 caring then you help the boys 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 clothes were all desperately need 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.070
 then you take care of it and then together 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.100
 game a little in the dressing room 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.570
 but those guys 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.310
 and then just makes fun a bit 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.380
 fooling around with each other 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.640
 ok what a joke in the dressing room 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.120
 often 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.740
 yes where they grow the good joke 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.910
 yes it is always that they have something about it 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.280
 the clothes either one through 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.200
 for example oreo who always had them 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.120
 a book about types of always throw them 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 right in your neck 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.810
 so all those words are waiting to share with you 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.610
 evil way well then yes you didn't give a damn 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.590
 because you are not a thing but in your neck 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.590
 hang the pocket and you put it away 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.520
 jan is also responsible for the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.990
 lettering of the shirts and the factory 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.310
 yes as is very happy with it while 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.750
 more difficult that is why I am too happy to have one 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.640
 very short name sometimes is for me 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 easier 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.900
 unfortunately psv recently blundered through the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.520
 names of wine balance and narsingh wrong 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.830
 pressing a competition show as a corner 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.510
 of goals for my model no we one 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.510
 I was not anonymous but the other of 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.690
 narsingh 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:28.880
 yes but so very annoying and is 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.740
 for everyone for the boy himself too 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.050
 annoying but they rarely see shirt too 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.220
 and hang them myself yet it attacks him 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.560
 on 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.770
 where can I find all the because he is at 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.599
 us then we are only the guilty ones 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.889
 you must include and certain names that you 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:44.720
 don't have that should you live should you 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.039
 letter by letter and you must live 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.690
 well if you spend the whole day with the 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.580
 training is in progress and you are with it 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.780
 bit of a must and they match 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.400
 come in from you have couple 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.690
 gloves then they can only put on 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.699
 oil then they need this 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.159
 well then you constantly want from work or 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.949
 money that goes wrong once in a while 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.560
 but yes in the 15 years i think their is 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.419
 best mining fall since the incident 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.650
 Jan uses what is pre-printed 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.569
 names 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.430
 The highest point in those 15 years were the 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.680
 trips on the flat cart after passing 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.569
 of the national championship if you say 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.470
 and for so many people on the side you 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.889
 right there now 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.479
 party with his old really super and 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.810
 I have never seen any rottenness in this 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:26.300
 Eindhoven so I think yes that 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.180
 I think it's really super this year 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.310
 we must assume that we are 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.349
 Think of a luck they certainly also 6 times 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.090
 in an impure so we assume 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.710
 and and so we win 6 times 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.479
 although it's the myself that think about it 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.620
 difficulties so you want to lead like me 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.320
 it knew yes I was not here 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:52.009
 mediq love women take including the 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:53.840
 man than make you see here how 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.340
 come along 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.340
 no one no and shirt away
