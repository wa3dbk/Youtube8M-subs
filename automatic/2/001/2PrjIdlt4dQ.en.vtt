and I kind of personalized it myself

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.360 
and I kind of personalized it myself
because<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> originally<00:02:37.830> didn't<00:02:38.040> really<00:02:38.220> like

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
because I originally didn't really like

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.090 
because I originally didn't really like
how<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.640> looked<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.810> first<00:02:40.050> off<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.620> fringes

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
how it looked so first off the fringes

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.160 
how it looked so first off the fringes
actually<00:02:41.700> were<00:02:41.880> straight<00:02:42.390> across<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.050> they

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
actually were straight across and they

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
actually were straight across and they
were<00:02:43.230> really<00:02:43.500> long<00:02:43.769> they<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.160> went<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:44.489> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
were really long they like went down to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.490 
were really long they like went down to
here<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> didn't<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.470> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
here and I didn't really like it so I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
here and I didn't really like it so I
cut<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.100> shorter<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.700> made<00:02:47.850> them<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.269> V

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
cut them shorter and made them into a V

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.090 
cut them shorter and made them into a V
so<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.870> they<00:02:49.140> kind<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.410> flowed<00:02:49.709> with<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
so that they kind of flowed with the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.340 
so that they kind of flowed with the
shape<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.580> purse<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.750> also<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
shape of the purse and then also the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.039 
shape of the purse and then also the
strap<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.220> long<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.239> right<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:55.019> I

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
strap was really long so right here I

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.020 
strap was really long so right here I
just<00:02:55.200> kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.739> folded<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> strap<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.970> then

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
just kind of folded the strap and then

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.830 
just kind of folded the strap and then
took<00:02:57.360> some<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.930> leftover<00:02:59.600> tassels<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.720> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
took some of the leftover tassels that I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720 
took some of the leftover tassels that I
had<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.470> then<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.799> made<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.100> knot<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.580> looks

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
had and then just made a knot it looks

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.490 
had and then just made a knot it looks
kind<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.030> awkward<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.600> whatever<00:03:04.260> there's

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
kind of awkward but whatever there's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.170 
kind of awkward but whatever there's
really<00:03:04.650> no<00:03:04.890> other<00:03:04.980> way<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.220> adjust<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.820> strap

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
really no other way to adjust the strap

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.319 
really no other way to adjust the strap
because<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.810> just<00:03:06.989> braided<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:09.120> how

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
because it's just braided so that's how

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.960 
because it's just braided so that's how
it<00:03:09.480> looks<00:03:09.690> too<00:03:10.049> far<00:03:10.320> away<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.920> love<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.670> purse
