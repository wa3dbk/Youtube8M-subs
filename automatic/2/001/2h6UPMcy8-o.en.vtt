robot used to inspect high-voltage
transmission<00:00:08.210> lines<00:00:09.639> nowadays<00:00:10.639> what<00:00:10.849> people

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
transmission lines nowadays what people

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.959 
transmission lines nowadays what people
do<00:00:11.300> is<00:00:11.830> either<00:00:12.830> they<00:00:13.160> use<00:00:13.280> helicopters<00:00:13.519> to

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
do is either they use helicopters to

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.410 
do is either they use helicopters to
check<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:15.019> lines<00:00:15.200> from<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.500> top<00:00:15.740> or<00:00:16.420> they

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
check the lines from the top or they

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.760 
check the lines from the top or they
have<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.720> stop<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.199> transmission<00:00:18.680> of

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
have to stop the transmission of

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.920 
have to stop the transmission of
electricity<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:19.490> send<00:00:20.180> people<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:20.570> do<00:00:20.810> this

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
electricity and send people to do this

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.259 
electricity and send people to do this
kind<00:00:21.170> of<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.260> job<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.160> sometimes<00:00:22.550> it's<00:00:22.789> 80

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
kind of a job so sometimes it's 80

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.420 
kind of a job so sometimes it's 80
meters<00:00:23.689> 100<00:00:24.230> meters<00:00:24.439> above<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.740> ground<00:00:24.890> and

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
meters 100 meters above the ground and

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.460 
meters 100 meters above the ground and
the<00:00:26.000> people<00:00:26.269> have<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.510> walk<00:00:26.750> on<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.080> cables

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
the people have to walk on the cables

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.759 
the people have to walk on the cables
and<00:00:27.740> just<00:00:28.670> inspect<00:00:29.090> them<00:00:29.330> by<00:00:29.449> hand<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:30.650> a

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
and just inspect them by hand so it's a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.729 
and just inspect them by hand so it's a
very<00:00:30.949> dangerous<00:00:31.220> job<00:00:31.670> it's<00:00:32.210> very<00:00:32.360> demanding

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
very dangerous job it's very demanding

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.160 
very dangerous job it's very demanding
and<00:00:33.739> it's<00:00:33.950> also<00:00:34.130> very<00:00:34.670> expensive<00:00:35.090> to<00:00:35.840> stop

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
and it's also very expensive to stop

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.100 
and it's also very expensive to stop
transmission<00:00:36.770> of<00:00:36.860> electricity<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.930> that's

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
transmission of electricity so that's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.930 
transmission of electricity so that's
why<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.379> developed<00:00:39.739> explainer<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:40.790> this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
why we developed explainer with this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.510 
why we developed explainer with this
machine<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:41.510> don't<00:00:41.690> need<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.930> stop<00:00:42.170> the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
machine we don't need to stop the

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.709 
machine we don't need to stop the
transmission<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.610> electricity<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.360> can<00:00:44.420> move

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
transmission of electricity it can move

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.500 
transmission of electricity it can move
on<00:00:44.899> on<00:00:45.050> live<00:00:45.440> lines<00:00:45.879> here<00:00:46.879> in<00:00:46.910> Japan<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.390> are

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
on on live lines here in Japan you are

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.959 
on on live lines here in Japan you are
using<00:00:47.660> up<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.320> five<00:00:48.530> hundred<00:00:48.559> kilovolts<00:00:49.190> but

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
using up to five hundred kilovolts but

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.330 
using up to five hundred kilovolts but
it<00:00:50.059> could<00:00:50.210> be<00:00:50.329> used<00:00:50.480> in<00:00:50.739> 750<00:00:51.739> kilowatts<00:00:52.160> for

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
it could be used in 750 kilowatts for

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.840 
it could be used in 750 kilowatts for
example<00:00:53.680> when<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.800> robot<00:00:55.129> comes<00:00:55.399> up<00:00:55.520> against

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
example when the robot comes up against

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.150 
example when the robot comes up against
obstacles<00:00:56.390> while<00:00:56.629> traversing<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.379> lines<00:00:57.590> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
obstacles while traversing the lines it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.010 
obstacles while traversing the lines it
can<00:00:58.399> manipulate<00:00:58.670> its<00:00:59.149> center<00:00:59.480> of<00:00:59.510> gravity<00:00:59.600> to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
can manipulate its center of gravity to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.060 
can manipulate its center of gravity to
move<00:01:00.350> around<00:01:00.500> them<00:01:01.809> there<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> huge<00:01:03.829> number

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
move around them there is a huge number

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.280 
move around them there is a huge number
of<00:01:04.220> obstacles<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.909> cross<00:01:05.150> there<00:01:05.930> are<00:01:06.020> cable

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
of obstacles to cross there are cable

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.050 
of obstacles to cross there are cable
spacers<00:01:06.799> they<00:01:07.340> are<00:01:07.400> used<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.729> keep<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
spacers they are used to keep the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.020 
spacers they are used to keep the
distance<00:01:08.360> between<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.900> lines<00:01:09.110> constant<00:01:09.770> and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
distance between the lines constant and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.399 
distance between the lines constant and
those<00:01:11.030> are<00:01:11.210> still<00:01:11.450> more<00:01:11.900> or<00:01:11.990> less<00:01:12.020> easy<00:01:12.290> to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
those are still more or less easy to

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.340 
those are still more or less easy to
cross<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.670> when<00:01:13.850> we<00:01:13.970> reach<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.299> tower<00:01:14.540> we

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
cross but when we reach the tower we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.170 
cross but when we reach the tower we
have<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.799> suspension<00:01:16.189> clamp<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
have the suspension clamp which is

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.030 
have the suspension clamp which is
basically<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.659> metallic<00:01:18.259> tool<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:18.950> is

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
basically a metallic tool that is

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.990 
basically a metallic tool that is
hanging<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.970> wires<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.759> find<00:01:22.939> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
hanging the wires and we have to find a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.609 
hanging the wires and we have to find a
way<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.150> cross<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.900> continue<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
way to cross that to continue to the

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.480 
way to cross that to continue to the
next<00:01:24.830> Tower

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
next Tower

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.429 
next Tower
so<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.299> is<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.720> strong<00:01:26.990> points<00:01:27.020> of

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
so this is one of the strong points of

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.620 
so this is one of the strong points of
explainer<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.130> was<00:01:28.250> developed<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:28.939> order<00:01:29.299> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
explainer it was developed in order to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.179 
explainer it was developed in order to
be<00:01:29.750> able<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.200> some<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.829> call<00:01:31.040> them

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
be able to do some we call them

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.120 
be able to do some we call them
acrobatic<00:01:31.729> motions<00:01:32.119> on<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.750> lines<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
acrobatic motions on the lines to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.039 
acrobatic motions on the lines to
overcome<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.729> obstacles<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.360> continue

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
overcome the obstacles and continue

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.350 
overcome the obstacles and continue
inspecting<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.250> for<00:01:37.490> example<00:01:37.850> if<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.030> stretch

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
inspecting so for example if we stretch

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.810 
inspecting so for example if we stretch
this<00:01:38.600> manipulator<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.650> way<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.400> one<00:01:40.549> side

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
this manipulator all the way to one side

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.359 
this manipulator all the way to one side
we<00:01:41.630> end<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:41.960> lifting<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.829> pulleys<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
we end up lifting the pulleys in the

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.580 
we end up lifting the pulleys in the
other<00:01:43.460> side<00:01:43.759> by<00:01:44.630> lifting<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.110> pulleys<00:01:45.439> then

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
other side by lifting the pulleys then

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.410 
other side by lifting the pulleys then
we<00:01:45.710> can<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.009> those<00:01:46.340> acrobatic<00:01:46.939> modes<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.299> was

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
we can do those acrobatic modes I was

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.899 
we can do those acrobatic modes I was
talking<00:01:47.750> about<00:01:47.780> rotate<00:01:48.500> them<00:01:48.649> outside<00:01:48.860> or<00:01:49.159> use

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
talking about rotate them outside or use

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.710 
talking about rotate them outside or use
them<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.270> overcome<00:01:50.600> obstacles<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:51.409> on<00:01:52.720> the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
them to overcome obstacles and so on the

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.810 
them to overcome obstacles and so on the
robot<00:01:54.049> uses<00:01:54.439> eight<00:01:54.590> cameras<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.220> inspect<00:01:55.579> four

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
robot uses eight cameras to inspect four

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850 
robot uses eight cameras to inspect four
lines<00:01:56.000> simultaneously<00:01:56.860> continuously

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
lines simultaneously continuously

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.569 
lines simultaneously continuously
recording<00:01:58.369> a<00:01:58.430> 360<00:01:59.299> degree<00:01:59.600> view<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.869> each<00:02:00.079> line

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
recording a 360 degree view of each line

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.789 
recording a 360 degree view of each line
it<00:02:01.579> also<00:02:01.759> records<00:02:02.119> GPS<00:02:02.750> information<00:02:03.049> as<00:02:03.560> well

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
it also records GPS information as well

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.560 
it also records GPS information as well
as<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.070> distance<00:02:04.369> from<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.670> tower<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.180> that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
as the distance from the tower so that

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
as the distance from the tower so that
any<00:02:05.840> defects<00:02:06.439> are<00:02:06.560> not<00:02:06.680> only<00:02:06.890> easy<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.310> locate

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
any defects are not only easy to locate

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.520 
any defects are not only easy to locate
but<00:02:08.090> also<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:08.509> operators<00:02:09.020> can<00:02:09.200> track<00:02:09.379> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
but also so operators can track the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.360 
but also so operators can track the
deterioration<00:02:10.129> of<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.520> lines<00:02:10.729> over<00:02:10.970> time
