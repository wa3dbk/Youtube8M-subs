00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 damn, the server you want to be 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 leader for an ip or building a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 he uses gps he is very good because he is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.219
 as if the cmd only that much better type o 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 senate second on the black little screen such as 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.559
 name in a much better way 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.110
 So I'll let it download, I do not know. 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.550
 staying at the was head of opposition 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.840
 link from his site I think it's better 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.149
 leave it here might have to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 extract something of the kind with them after all he 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 will be here the first thing to be 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 go 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
 on the part of its servers of the case that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 server that I use in other videos 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.010
 You 'll get him the banquet and go. 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 play that guy the server and runs 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 how to administer 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.200
 you do not necessarily have to play 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 inside the folder 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.869
 But I think it's better not the one who gives it to you. 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.650
 My version is 1,583 but it's only to see 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's not tasty minecraft is for 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 172 version of it's 1.9 it's the version 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 it will not stay if this version here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 that using is for 1.5.2 4 total more 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.909
 I think it works on your whole baby 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.369
 here is an update is you 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.079

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:53.100
 updated or let put ignore 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:56.100
 when you want to update in an early April 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
 this small screen here then it would be up 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.740
 there I only know much 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.630
 the plug ins installed the museum you only have 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.320
 province that would exclude some 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.649
 on here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.590
 this tank it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.590

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 digital life or death here facility 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.250
 because there is a person named after 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.319
 back at night he puts on it stayed 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.670
 pretty bonnie pebane of these things 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.090
 makes it much easier 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.180
 ok now it 's showing that part backups and 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.060
 manufactured server if these 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.769
 things here or here the information will 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.769
 grow here right? 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:13.400

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:32.410
 java java I 've seen a team 7 for 64 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:39.290
 bits and here's going to be ram memory 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:45.760
 dedicated to the server let me put 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:52.819
 All my life I'm going to leave here in 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.790

 you will click on it simply ok 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:14.989

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:18.139
 stage will now appear here only for 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.829
 this second channel is starting 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.620
 server as you can see 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.620
 Are you carrying there? 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.419

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.370
 it is not 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.870
 You'll see when it's going to be, I'll stay. 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:53.139

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.449
 It's not just anyone when it's written. 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.479
 error in the place of origin is and here it is only 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.199
 to be aware that it can cause problems 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.830
 future is then this is the banquet and here 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.389
 O 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.810
 If I log into the server it will show 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.370
 I 'm not going to come in here because I sang it. 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.810
 how was his 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.340
 if you want to make a backup then 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.060
 that execute pa 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.379
 But I'm from here, it 's the province right here. 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.490
 develop 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:32.919
 I think it's also works here. 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.000
 ct uses the web esaj total the total server 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.620
 ranking 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.770
 and something else it stays open that should 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.719
 also it is open here has people 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:51.310
 that close here to reopen the globe 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:53.860
 here then is this here is said top 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.110
 another server for it is hit r 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:03.810
 load and reload that close the process of the 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.889
 hell my great hockey server neither 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.830
 Socrates here if you want to send a 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.819
 message in its type but also serves as a 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.779
 as if that bar knows is that the command 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:20.379
 It's here so this one is very good. 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:22.060
 percent it is very useful gave by 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.940
 schools I made this video that I found 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.969
 very good, people who got there 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.069
 give a like write the channel because it has 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:32.430
 very little written that I could write 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.610
 i thanked urban planted 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.800
