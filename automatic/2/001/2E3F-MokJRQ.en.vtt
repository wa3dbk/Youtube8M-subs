00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.099
 Today Thank you very much for seeing it is braking in I'm a student 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:13.950
 Today's one point lesson is outside suburb type 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:18.870
 I will try to do a training to pull out the bonds of those with strong diplomacy 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.320
 Would especially toward the outside wall of turn to the outside of it is diplomacy diplomacy 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.900
 Such movement 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.500
 We will try to introduce the of that training to pull out the habit that go by far the the 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.410
 I will 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.190
 What do you do? Well I use in the lesson quite a bit weird slip 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.740
 I will 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.960
 a 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.120
 When sliding out, the movement of the foot is already basically the same 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.740
 the first 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 You left 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.239
 Yes 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.100
 It will feel like I'm going to slide to the left all the time 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.120
 As a way, for example , we will publicize in basic stance 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.180
 From where I took the position with the ski also facing forward 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.629
 the a right arm 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.280
 Put on skis 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:15.090
 In the left arm the left arm opens with the right angle breathing every time you say 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.720
 It is right next to you , so you can turn it right next to you and your body should be in the middle of its open arms. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 Turn to 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 In the waist at this time also a please a little open 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:30.930
 It's the other side, it's not open to this side, it's not going straight ahead, it's a little 45 degrees diagonally 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:37.530
 It's about meeting and 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:45.600
 I think that the top of the ski naturally comes out a little ahead of the right foot brain when I try to get in 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.810
 Yes, if you start with this attitude, I will go to both ends in a row. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.950
 The left hand goes sideways as it slides 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 Right hand on skis 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:01.290
 So let's go inside that ski in reverse 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 I always looked right above the skis to avoid going outside 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.200
 Open 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.570
 Turn to the middle of the street 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:17.770
 In remains towards the top top also all the time the right foot of the ski came out a little this is in go all that 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:21.070
 By the lift of the turn by the inclination of the slope, the evidence of morning skill moves 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.100
 The ski on the right foot can slide forward 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:28.970
 Especially the waist is 5 so that the waist does not turn round and round 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:36.200
 Please try to aware that go all those facing left to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.700
 Yes If you're going to be in diplomacy what to do with this, it's always here during that turn 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.470
 Then look out 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 The big of the one pattern body which says that it will turn over already if it enters into the end of 8 here 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 It has become an unpatterned it 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.000
 Not to say I can also be directed to anywhere their high body soft and elsewhere in Germany 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.980
 I dare a little in order to use soften the body 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.400
 One side 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.150
 Which of the terms belt while facing 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.390
 Leave the pattern to so is Toka switched here opposite to the normally 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:13.910
 Hip in a direction which can not be there in the direction was all up to and Enma now to go all this 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.970
 Finished 5-turn until the opposite is not Damn I mean is it basic now or the when going into the next turn 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.500
 Maybe a floor 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:26.220
 All round I think that would peeled Cala of there way to the moment you enter in Konan 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:29.670
 It is the end of the turn that it is the practice now, and next time I enter the turn, I will keep looking forward to the next 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.960
 Wind say so because facing sideways going into the turn 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:42.160
 A little bit different from how I used to use my body 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.970
 If you make that first place easy to move anywhere you will remember to the body the movement of the waist that is different from before until now 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.040
 Let me 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.819
 Slip in and let's facing such Well the middle from where did both this as you face 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.639
 I will 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:58.060
 When I usually slip, I 'm slipping in front of me with ease and without holding it again 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:06.270
 It is but it is I think its identity is made easier 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:12.690
 This kind of movement that was doing now had slipped outside off-premises groove interchanged way to that now 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:18.330
 As I did the bell that moved to look at one cheek outside, I made the waist move, so 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.440
 I think it would be easier to go straight ahead and slide, so I ordered after doing it 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:25.920
 Please try it all 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.260
 Yes I actually move in the direction of the video I tried to take a sliding movement so by all means 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.500
 Measure 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.500
 Please take a look and move to the video if you enter 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:44.729
 We will continue to the description in the way of moving in yes, but the video of you taken to No 8 This considerably before combed 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:50.069
 But after the top Toka orientation of the arm just described of Mars key open to 90 degrees 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.820
 I'm going to turn to the side of the waist, and I'm just going to turn sideways 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:59.830
 Because there are all schools in the training that 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:03.560
 In fact, when you do , put your arm on the ski and the opposite left arm opens 90 degrees sideways. 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.750
 Please try using as a guide 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:15.139
 Yes I feel this way If you put your right arm forward and open your left side 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:18.600
 Yes, according to it, the direction of the chest also turns to the side and the waist is open as much as possible 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:24.600
 I will slide to the left 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:26.249
 Yes, this time again the opposite is osce on the left, so the right arm is open 90 degrees horizontally and the waist is also oriented 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.670
 Mini as possible 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.090
 Yes 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.500
 It is good before and after as much as possible 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:40.400
 Please try to adjust 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:45.680
 Yes, I will go straight after this, but I will slip with the stock on top of both skis 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.990
 Always go all so as to keep its stock from the top of the butt when we slipped in the mass 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.810
 It is the movement of the waist by 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:56.419
 Body orientation or waist orientation 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:58.780
 It will be training that all goes in order by the body even if it likes not to go to diplomacy 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.780
 I will 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.270
 It feels like one 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:11.939
 Especially I think it would be better to look at the stock ring, but my ski top 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.939
 I think it is easy to try to put the ring on top of 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:19.400
 How is it? It feels like it's like this, I'm going to slide all the way while facing one side 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:25.220
 It's kind of unbalanced nurse berry but this 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:29.030
 Since Well practice body with the fact that such a thing try doing a little break dare cormorant slip 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.100
 By but of you a chance to move as unlike until now 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:38.010
 a by all means do please try wearing Dating 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:43.650
 Since this rate it is is I just decided let's go simply of cold weather, for example, a me in your previous 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:46.050
 The arms opposite the large skis on the back skis can be turned to the side of the skis 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.700
 It is good if you look at the sideways too 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.090
 Well , I think it's good to try it in various directions that are easy to do, so arrange it 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.990
 By all means practice 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.260
 Thank you for seeing the video today by say entered Why not try to 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.260
 Was
