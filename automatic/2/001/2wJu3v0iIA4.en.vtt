 here you control 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.630
 and you 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.780

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.660
 competition felipe our layer of 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.740

 with them they are companions 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.189
 the time and the brand are still 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.539
 registered by our judges and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.820
 we are solving an inconvenience 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.619
 technician is well done they are medicated for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.619

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.569
 time please 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.859
 the judges continue to record the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.780
 chimes of the yellow team so that 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:31.550
 do not worry and also the time 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.480
 I would like to know that what happens with the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.140
 red team 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.879
 what is happening katy contreras is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.209
 it was from the study to read I do not know if I 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.209
 listeners 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.440
 if you liked jean-philippe you listen 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.090
 also if it 's perfect afterwards 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.420
 treat it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.840
 Contreras is also going, we are not going to 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.069
 go the audio because unfortunately 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.720
 permission for the same prisoner here 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.030
 because I would like to talk to the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.290
 Andy red team please explain 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.810
 faith that what happens because the team 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.130
 red is taking this determination that 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.600
 generates quite a problem of 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.580
 competition 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.560
 Katy presented that she did not want to compete in 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.319
 the complementary gymnastics for the theme 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.180
 that the head was dizzy and already entered 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.190
 with this description a moment that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.400
 shared they said 321 and stayed 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.410
 Looking at me, it's not up to me 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.660
 I have truth and now I did not make the decision 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.980
 of competing the trunks out 6 the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.110
 clique is from right 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.569
 André to have made it very clear to 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.549
 inconveniences here of course katy 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.560
 against the simple ere she lets compete 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:40.110
 we lose the day and if it is fair and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.140
 yes before going with the yellow team 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.910
 because it is a drawback of red 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.250
 mainly you meet and count 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.280
 and 100 in the is and what do you think about 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.380
 this 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.750
 the session of catí contreras and obviously 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.080
 that affects you to 30 months 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.640
 I believe or better I'm going to say this myself 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.380
 I do not have anything personal against the CND and 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.080
 contreras is a very good companion very 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.580
 good friend however as a competitor 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.010
 at this moment he is not giving what 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810
 I should do clearly and diaz be a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.819
 man nominated and for us equal 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.190
 We are fighting or competing in 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.330
 set to not go then is 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.310
 unfortunate for us that when 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.540
 they ask us to help me 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.240
 and the commitment of all your arguments 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.950
 felipe inform me that katy contreras 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.440
 is locked up does not want to talk nor 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.030
 co-production or with part of their 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.760
 team is constant federico in the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.320
 Shabby dressing rooms because always with 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.389
 the dialogue will solve things 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.430
 charly something I wanted to say about the team 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.710
 yellow let's see if katie manages 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.990
 return and manages to retake the competition 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.120
 but the clear result is that almost 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.669
 sometimes he is being very responsible 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.370
 with your team with us with everything 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.370
 cast with the street 7 audience left 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.080
 your team fully voted voted 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.970
 we can not deliver a 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.919
 competition if she is not ready follow 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.479
 is not ready to compete and do the 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.120
 effort for your team I think very 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.650
 goat girl looks like katy contreras 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.750
 have personal problems all 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.610
 days but you have to leave it at 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.410
 side and compete because we do not 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.870
 we can compete I'm wet because 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.050
 we compete well that was and left 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.120
 his team behaved very badly very badly 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.580
 the federico captain costa mind 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.800
 they know what strikes me 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.590
 that there are many people giving a month 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.110
 for the final 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.920
 that are removed from in your boyfriend 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.810
 or they get angry then fernando 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.520
 dashing for example and if I'm in the 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.639
 banking I do not want to compete even though 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.650
 Katy be your best in your opinion 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.479
 Katy see and seize the opportunity that 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.310
 has to compete not all of us have the 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.539
 possibility of doing it so nothing if 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.800
 he does not want to compete that is his place 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.139
 because we have highs that we want 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.490
 to compete 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.289
 what will happen to this 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.300
 competition you meet federer 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.099
 Federico quite upset I do not want 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.599
 talk a lot but I insist federico 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.969
 we make the program for the people the 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.259
 that every day thanks us what happens 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.200
 with chants 3 what about the team 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.970
 Red 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.040
 everything we know what happens with 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.150
 katie contreras 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.070
 internally the partners know by 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.440
 what cons we are up to date on this one 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.120
 personal problem which has not 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.030
 end on 7th street but it has it 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.860
 completely the head pulls out 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.390
 unfortunately he had the error of leaving 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.980
 the drawer to that from where because still 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.860
 does not appear the helmet cat and contreras or 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.440
 At least I still do not see it and 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.610
 sorry come on 81 down I think I do not 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.920
 is good to continue competing is 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.920
 The result is irremovable 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.020
 let me ask you the red team 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.480
 leave the competition or continue in 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.840
 competition 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.770
 and I personally do not follow 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.610
 competing for lepe or reason I think 181 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.960
 and impossible to make us much advantage not 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.760
 is that we are competing badly 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.470
 directly they took us many laps 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.660
 because they delayed us because a 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.220
 partner did not have the guilt helmet that 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.690
 this group but it seems that the criterion 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.850
 that is applying capital is not a 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.960
 report because android know it says no me 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.090
 the result matters what I want 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.560
 compete or we always say that the 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.730
 there is competition really the same 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.260
 if contreras does not want to compete 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.510
 let's finish the test by more than 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.340
 lose color theme with a red 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.130
 we combine with blood fuck let's go 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.880
 6 the capi the captain has the last 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.880
 word only 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:25.420
 continue or not follow in faith 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.870
 they want to compete again 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.940
 that is not who I personally am 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.220
 I prefer to save myself for the last test 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.350
 that we have defined the day to try 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:39.210
 trace something that we all know is 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:41.220
 irremovable you are captain you decide 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.350
 as data I can tell you that there are two 

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.860
 minutes of competition we abandon the 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.740
 ayayay test leaves then the 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.650
 competition 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.300
 this as a result of which katy contreras 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.460
 withdrew from the test the red team 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.780
 he decides not to follow the triumph he goes to 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.150
 the yellow team that has won all 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.150
 the tests 

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.960
 the present day 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.960
 the product
