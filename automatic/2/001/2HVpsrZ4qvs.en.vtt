 this is the dining room space 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.789
 It is also a place where we meet 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.039
 to eat as a family or when you are 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.090
 making a little cold we take advantage of 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.920
 slaves and nothing to share a while together 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.020
 and have a great time 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.290
 I am fortunate to have a kitchen 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.820
 spacious and with a view of nature 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.159
 so I think it's a great blessing 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.250
 and a great pleasure to be able to lift all of them 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.899

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.659
 I am not to say the most fond of the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.799
