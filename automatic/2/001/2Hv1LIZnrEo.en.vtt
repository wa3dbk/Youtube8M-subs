carbon<00:00:18.140> 2075<00:00:19.490> mountain<00:00:20.490> bike<00:00:20.630> some<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
carbon 2075 mountain bike some of the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.330 
carbon 2075 mountain bike some of the
unique<00:00:21.990> features<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.130> really

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
unique features on this one we really

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.849 
unique features on this one we really
wanted<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.789> true<00:00:24.720> all-mountain<00:00:24.900> geometry<00:00:25.769> on

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
wanted a true all-mountain geometry on

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.800 
wanted a true all-mountain geometry on
here<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> kept<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.550> 67<00:00:27.210> degree<00:00:27.449> headtube

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
here so we kept a 67 degree headtube

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
here so we kept a 67 degree headtube
angle<00:00:27.920> 12<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> 1/2<00:00:29.189> inch<00:00:29.519> bottom<00:00:29.880> bracket

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
angle 12 and 1/2 inch bottom bracket

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.110 
angle 12 and 1/2 inch bottom bracket
height<00:00:30.359> 72<00:00:30.929> 73<00:00:31.529> degrees<00:00:31.920> suit<00:00:32.130> tube<00:00:32.309> angle<00:00:32.669> one

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
height 72 73 degrees suit tube angle one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
height 72 73 degrees suit tube angle one
of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.270> bike<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.600> could<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.899> really

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
of the bike that you could really really

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
of the bike that you could really really
throw<00:00:35.070> around<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> fun<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> we

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
throw around have a lot of fun on we

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
throw around have a lot of fun on we
really<00:00:37.079> emphasize<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> weight<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.129> bike

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
really emphasize the weight on this bike

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
really emphasize the weight on this bike
so<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.300> kept<00:00:39.510> things<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> full<00:00:40.140> carbon

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so we kept things like the full carbon

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.520 
so we kept things like the full carbon
fiber<00:00:40.530> rocker<00:00:40.980> link<00:00:41.809> also<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
fiber rocker link also with the the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.930 
fiber rocker link also with the the
molding<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.129> running<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.520> our<00:00:44.550> frames

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
molding that we're running on our frames

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.940 
molding that we're running on our frames
we<00:00:45.360> use<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> cool<00:00:45.750> system<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.230> 3d<00:00:46.559> printers<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we use a cool system with 3d printers to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
we use a cool system with 3d printers to
create<00:00:47.360> mandrels

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
create mandrels

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.920 
create mandrels
to<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.379> our<00:00:49.500> carbon<00:00:50.360> layup<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.600> wrap<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to get our carbon layup when we wrap the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350 
to get our carbon layup when we wrap the
carbon<00:00:52.289> doing<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> little

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
carbon doing so we can get get a little

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
carbon doing so we can get get a little
extra<00:00:55.199> resin<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.949> frames<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.699> our

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
extra resin out of the frames so our

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.069 
extra resin out of the frames so our
smooth<00:00:57.000> interiors<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> way<00:00:57.780> through<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
smooth interiors all the way through you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.720 
smooth interiors all the way through you
don't<00:00:58.230> have<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.070> carbon<00:00:59.399> ripples<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
don't have the the carbon ripples that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.560 
don't have the the carbon ripples that
you<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.539> find<00:01:00.899> sometimes<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:02.010> layups

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
you do so you find sometimes with layups

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.759 
you do so you find sometimes with layups
doing<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> were<00:01:03.960> able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> get

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
doing that we were able to get the get

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
doing that we were able to get the get
the<00:01:04.890> weight<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> frame<00:01:05.659> down<00:01:06.659> quite<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> bit

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the weight on the frame down quite a bit

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
the weight on the frame down quite a bit
we're<00:01:08.189> at<00:01:08.280> four<00:01:08.520> point<00:01:08.790> nine<00:01:08.970> pounds<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.479> our

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
we're at four point nine pounds on our

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
we're at four point nine pounds on our
frame<00:01:09.840> weight<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> incredibly<00:01:11.189> light

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
frame weight which is incredibly light

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.679 
frame weight which is incredibly light
really<00:01:12.360> stiff<00:01:12.659> frame<00:01:12.960> running<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:14.150> 142<00:01:15.150> by<00:01:15.330> 12

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

rear<00:01:15.930> axle<00:01:17.150> on<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.570> bike<00:01:18.920> really<00:01:19.920> excited

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
rear axle on this bike really excited

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.990 
rear axle on this bike really excited
about<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
about this one

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.609 
about this one
I<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.170> geometry<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.880> suspension<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
I the geometry of the the suspension is

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.840 
I the geometry of the the suspension is
really<00:01:25.619> been<00:01:25.740> fantastic

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
really been fantastic

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.749 
really been fantastic
a<00:01:26.880> lot<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> penalty<00:01:27.750> efficiency<00:01:28.430> but<00:01:29.430> really

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
a lot of penalty efficiency but really

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.249 
a lot of penalty efficiency but really
something<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.450> plush<00:01:30.720> we're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
something that's really plush we're

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
something that's really plush we're
really<00:01:31.680> utilizing<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> height<00:01:32.880> adjust<00:01:33.180> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
really utilizing the height adjust on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
really utilizing the height adjust on
the<00:01:33.390> suspension<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> bike<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.590> bike<00:01:34.740> will

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the suspension on the bike the bike will

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.179 
the suspension on the bike the bike will
be<00:01:35.070> coming<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> 34<00:01:36.119> talus<00:01:36.619> from<00:01:37.619> Fox<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
be coming with a 34 talus from Fox and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
be coming with a 34 talus from Fox and
so<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> changes<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> height<00:01:39.900> adjust

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so with the changes on the height adjust

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.499 
so with the changes on the height adjust
with<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> talus<00:01:41.700> suspension<00:01:42.119> we're

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
with the with the talus suspension we're

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
with the with the talus suspension we're
really<00:01:42.630> getting<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:42.990> characteristics<00:01:43.619> out

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
really getting two characteristics out

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
really getting two characteristics out
of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> bike<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.549> bike<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> descends<00:01:45.270> very

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
of the bike one bike that descends very

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.100 
of the bike one bike that descends very
very<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:45.930> well<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> want

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
very very well but then you know we want

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.690 
very very well but then you know we want
you<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> earn<00:01:49.860> those<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.460> those

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you to want you to earn those in those

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
you to want you to earn those in those
descents<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.570> change<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.619> height<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
descents so change the the height on the
