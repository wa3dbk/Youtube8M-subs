plate and this is what we have okay it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.430 
plate and this is what we have okay it
is<00:02:41.520> not<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.240> did<00:02:42.420> not<00:02:42.570> cut<00:02:42.900> all<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> way

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
is not it did not cut all the way

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.400 
is not it did not cut all the way
through<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:45.000> now<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.780> need<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.020> do<00:02:46.170> is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
through so now what we need to do is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.970 
through so now what we need to do is
switch<00:02:46.740> over<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.430> C<00:02:47.700> plate<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
switch over to the C plate to do the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.850 
switch over to the C plate to do the
cutting<00:02:50.310> part<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.240> first<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.810> embosses<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
cutting part so first it embosses and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.730 
cutting part so first it embosses and
then<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.670> cuts<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.260> now<00:02:55.410> we're<00:02:55.620> gonna

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
then it cuts and then now we're gonna

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.170 
then it cuts and then now we're gonna
run<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.250> through<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.700> you'll<00:02:56.790> hear<00:02:57.030> the
