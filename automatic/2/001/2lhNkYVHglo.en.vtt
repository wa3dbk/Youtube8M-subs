you get a high definition AV cable you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.410 
you get a high definition AV cable you
see<00:02:34.950> right<00:02:35.070> over<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.490> side<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
see right over there on the side it's we

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780 
see right over there on the side it's we
works<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> regular<00:02:37.200> TV<00:02:37.380> or<00:02:37.680> an<00:02:38.250> HDTV

works with the regular TV or an HDTV

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.120 
works with the regular TV or an HDTV
signal<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.750> way<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.080> works<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.500> let<00:02:40.980> me<00:02:41.040> show

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
signal the way that works is let me show

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.990 
signal the way that works is let me show
you<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> connectors<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.760> these<00:02:41.940> are

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
you the connectors here these are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.850 
you the connectors here these are
composites<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> standard<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.740> know

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
composites for the standard you know

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.830 
composites for the standard you know
definition<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.460> then<00:02:44.850> these<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.150> components

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
definition and then these are components

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.060 
definition and then these are components
you<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.050> they've<00:02:46.200> separated<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.680> color<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
you see they've separated the color the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.920 
you see they've separated the color the
red<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> green<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.820> blue<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.630> have

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
red the green in the blue so you have

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.480 
red the green in the blue so you have
component<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.530> composite<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:50.400> you're

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
component or composite and when you're

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.680 
component or composite and when you're
using<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> composite<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.330> need<00:02:51.510> audio

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
using the composite if you need audio

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.000 
using the composite if you need audio
and<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.050> will<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> surrounds<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.740> system

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and you will have a surrounds a system

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.980 
and you will have a surrounds a system
right<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> back<00:02:53.910> there<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.900> an

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
right on the back there that is an

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.280 
right on the back there that is an
optical<00:02:55.500> audio<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.610> full

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
optical audio out so you can get full

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.570 
optical audio out so you can get full
5.1<00:02:58.290> channel<00:02:58.440> surround<00:02:58.710> sound<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.310> one

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
5.1 channel surround sound with one

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000 
5.1 channel surround sound with one
cable<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.810> very<00:03:01.170> cool<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.800> comes

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
cable that is very cool and that comes

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.890 
cable that is very cool and that comes
