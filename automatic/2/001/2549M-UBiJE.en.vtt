00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this one oh look it's off already look

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.320 
this one oh look it's off already look
at<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:10.490> how<00:01:11.490> quick<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
at that how quick was that and then

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
at that how quick was that and then
that's<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> its<00:01:13.170> fact<00:01:13.920> its

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that's just back to its fact its

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
that's just back to its fact its
original<00:01:14.490> size<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.509> simply<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.960> need<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
original size and that simply we need to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
original size and that simply we need to
do<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.490> couple<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.210> Hoops<00:01:22.970> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
do then is just a couple of Hoops that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
do then is just a couple of Hoops that
we've<00:01:24.119> got<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.689> look<00:01:25.170> at<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
we've got here look at these this is the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.910 
we've got here look at these this is the
other<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> up<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> wall<00:01:33.920> she's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
other way this is up on the wall she's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
other way this is up on the wall she's
not<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:35.310> or<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.939> solution<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
not good or this solution here with the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.580 
not good or this solution here with the
kinks<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
kinks in it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
kinks in it
I<00:01:37.829> mean<00:01:38.009> sometimes<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.030> these

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I mean sometimes when you take these

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.399 
I mean sometimes when you take these
runs<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.110> pull<00:01:40.290> these

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
runs out as well when you pull these

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
runs out as well when you pull these
runs<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.759> end<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.000> kinked<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.420> then

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
runs out they end up kinked and then

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
runs out they end up kinked and then
occasionally<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.439> when<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> wind<00:01:44.189> them

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
occasionally you know when you wind them

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
occasionally you know when you wind them
back<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.729> sometimes<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
back on sometimes they do this kind of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
back on sometimes they do this kind of
thing<00:01:46.439> where<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> side<00:01:47.280> they've

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
thing where they go on the side they've

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310
