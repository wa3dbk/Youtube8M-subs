00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
inside the case and take a closer look

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.960 
inside the case and take a closer look
so<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> duro<00:02:30.740> folio<00:02:31.100> with<00:02:31.340> my<00:02:31.520> iPad

so this is the duro folio with my iPad

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.150 
so this is the duro folio with my iPad
Mini<00:02:32.270> inside<00:02:32.840> as<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.320> can<00:02:33.470> see<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> front<00:02:34.040> is

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
Mini inside as you can see the front is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.220 
Mini inside as you can see the front is
completely<00:02:34.280> protected<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.540> bottom<00:02:35.810> offers<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
completely protected the bottom offers a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.940 
completely protected the bottom offers a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
perforations for the speakers so the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.730 
perforations for the speakers so the
speakers<00:02:41.780> are<00:02:41.930> actually<00:02:42.260> behind<00:02:42.590> the

material but the sound can come through
which<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.260> actually<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> very<00:02:45.800> nice<00:02:46.010> design

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
which is actually a very nice design

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.270 
which is actually a very nice design
approach<00:02:47.080> here<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> side<00:02:48.590> what<00:02:49.130> you'll

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

is no lay on the table protection for

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.229 
is no lay on the table protection for
this<00:03:48.620> mine<00:03:49.250> comes<00:03:49.550> up<00:03:49.730> just<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:50.000> little<00:03:50.030> bit

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
this mine comes up just a little bit

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.120 
this mine comes up just a little bit
over<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.140> edge<00:03:51.260> here<00:03:51.500> but<00:03:51.709> that's<00:03:51.860> because<00:03:52.010> I

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
over the edge here but that's because I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.949 
over the edge here but that's because I
have<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.340> glass<00:03:52.550> screen<00:03:52.700> protector<00:03:53.209> on<00:03:53.360> my<00:03:53.570> iPad

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
have a glass screen protector on my iPad

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.570 
have a glass screen protector on my iPad
Mini<00:03:54.200> now<00:03:54.739> where<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.010> becomes<00:03:55.400> really

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
Mini now where this becomes really

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.820 
Mini now where this becomes really
helpful<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.600> this<00:03:56.930> back<00:03:57.230> corner<00:03:57.530> piece

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
helpful is that this back corner piece

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.670 
helpful is that this back corner piece
separates<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.420> creates<00:03:59.870> a<00:04:00.020> very<00:04:00.350> very

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
separates and it creates a very very

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.930 
separates and it creates a very very
nice<00:04:00.830> very<00:04:01.489> very<00:04:01.820> functional<00:04:02.390> multi<00:04:03.380> angle

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
nice very very functional multi angle

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.940 
nice very very functional multi angle
stand<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.660> this<00:04:05.989> is<00:04:06.170> actually<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.650> steepest

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
stand so this is actually the steepest

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.250 
stand so this is actually the steepest
angle<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.550> you<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.850> get<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.330> then<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.140> will

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
angle that you can get and then it will

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.420 
angle that you can get and then it will
actually<00:04:09.670> go<00:04:10.670> down<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.870> by<00:04:12.019> one<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:13.250> case

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
actually go down one by one and the case

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.030 
actually go down one by one and the case
actually<00:04:13.790> sits<00:04:14.030> inside<00:04:14.540> these<00:04:15.410> perforations

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
actually sits inside these perforations

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.099 
actually sits inside these perforations
that<00:04:16.340> are<00:04:16.549> here<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.750> actually<00:04:18.049> a

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
that are here and this is actually a

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.449 
that are here and this is actually a
very<00:04:18.320> very<00:04:18.560> comfortable<00:04:18.769> let's<00:04:19.100> rotate<00:04:19.310> this

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
very very comfortable let's rotate this

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.780 
very very comfortable let's rotate this
around

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.910 

and<00:04:23.790> this<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:24.990> very<00:04:25.350> very<00:04:25.560> comfortable

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
and this is a very very comfortable

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.880 
and this is a very very comfortable
viewing<00:04:26.730> angle<00:04:27.240> if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.440> are<00:04:28.650> watching

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
viewing angle if you are watching

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.150 
viewing angle if you are watching
something<00:04:29.580> even<00:04:30.390> better<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.170> up<00:04:31.650> like

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
something even better if it's up like

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.360 
something even better if it's up like
that<00:04:32.640> so<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.810> lot<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:34.860> different<00:04:35.190> viewing

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
that so a lot of different viewing

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.610 
that so a lot of different viewing
angles<00:04:35.730> offered<00:04:36.180> by<00:04:36.390> this<00:04:36.450> case<00:04:36.960> which<00:04:37.410> is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
angles offered by this case which is

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.840 
angles offered by this case which is
really<00:04:38.520> quite<00:04:38.970> nice<00:04:39.390> in<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.650> folio<00:04:41.190> case<00:04:41.490> like

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
really quite nice in a folio case like

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.360 
really quite nice in a folio case like
this<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.960> holds<00:04:43.350> very<00:04:43.470> very<00:04:44.010> well<00:04:44.220> it's

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
this and it holds very very well it's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.010 
this and it holds very very well it's
actually<00:04:44.700> not<00:04:44.820> going<00:04:44.880> anywhere<00:04:45.480> until<00:04:45.690> you
