00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.780 

as<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> closure<00:01:38.250> goes<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
as you can see the closure goes all the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.920 
as you can see the closure goes all the
way<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> closure<00:01:39.720> is

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
way back here and the closure is

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.130 
way back here and the closure is
actually<00:01:40.500> pretty<00:01:40.770> wide<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:43.049> here

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
actually pretty wide it goes from here

actually pretty wide it goes from here
to<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.470> wide

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
to here so it's actually pretty wide

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.230 
to here so it's actually pretty wide

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
better you know unfortunately the 22s

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.270 
better you know unfortunately the 22s
was<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.829> enough<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.490> make<00:01:59.729> my<00:02:00.920> u<00:02:01.920> part<00:02:02.219> wig

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.850 
was not enough to make my u part wig
with<00:02:02.670> closures<00:02:03.210> deal<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> usually

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
with closures deal that I usually

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
with closures deal that I usually
you<00:02:05.430> know<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.730> longer<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.240> length<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
you know the longer the length the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.560 
you know the longer the length the
longer<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.290> hair<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.100> less<00:02:08.369> wet<00:02:08.759> wet<00:02:09.539> wet

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
longer the hair is the less wet wet wet

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.780 
longer the hair is the less wet wet wet
wet<00:02:10.370> since<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.570> get<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
wet since you you actually get so I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.430 
wet since you you actually get so I
should<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.390> got<00:02:15.620> four<00:02:16.620> bundles<00:02:16.920> but

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
should have got four bundles but

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.860 
should have got four bundles but
whenever<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> three<00:02:19.770> bundles<00:02:20.040> were<00:02:20.870> like

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
whenever the three bundles were like

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.800 
whenever the three bundles were like
again<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.380> was<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.830> enough<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.820> actually<00:02:24.240> had

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
again it was it enough so I actually had

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.070 
again it was it enough so I actually had
a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.710> bit<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.340> some<00:02:26.850> deep<00:02:27.420> curly<00:02:27.810> hair

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
a little bit of some deep curly hair

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.310 
a little bit of some deep curly hair
that<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.860> put<00:02:29.130> at<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> top<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
that I just put at the top and as you

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.470 
that I just put at the top and as you
can<00:02:31.410> see<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.860> looks<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.370> same<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:32.970> there's<00:02:33.209> no

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
can see it looks the same so there's no

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
can see it looks the same so there's no
real<00:02:33.900> big<00:02:34.080> difference<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:35.730> textures<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.620> yep<00:02:38.100> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
real big difference in textures so yep I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.780 
real big difference in textures so yep I
guess<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.660> really<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.290> three<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
guess so really I have three and a

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
guess so really I have three and a
quarter<00:02:44.420> bundles<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.510> my<00:02:45.600> head<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
quarter bundles in my head and then the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.949 
quarter bundles in my head and then the
closure<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.910> hair<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.330> jet<00:02:48.630> black<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
closure so this hair is jet black I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.940 
closure so this hair is jet black I
actually<00:02:49.290> had<00:02:50.190> bought<00:02:50.430> some<00:02:51.530> jet<00:02:52.530> black<00:02:52.709> dye

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
actually had bought some jet black dye

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.740 
actually had bought some jet black dye
because<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.489> love<00:02:54.230> jet<00:02:55.230> black<00:02:55.530> curly<00:02:56.100> hair<00:02:56.750> but

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
because I love jet black curly hair but

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.540 
because I love jet black curly hair but
when<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.989> got<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> bundles<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.160> seen<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
when I got the bundles I seen that the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.280 
when I got the bundles I seen that the
hair<00:02:59.670> was<00:02:59.790> already<00:03:00.030> jet<00:03:00.510> black<00:03:00.750> which<00:03:01.020> was

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
hair was already jet black which was

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.620 
hair was already jet black which was
great<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.190> me<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> site<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.600> think

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
great for me now on the site I think

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.780 
great for me now on the site I think
that<00:03:03.959> they<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.410> different<00:03:05.070> colors<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.610> can

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that they have different colors you can

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.420 
that they have different colors you can
