questions about decaffeinated teas the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.060 
questions about decaffeinated teas the
easiest<00:01:02.670> question<00:01:03.090> first<00:01:03.530> which<00:01:04.530> teas<00:01:04.830> have

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
easiest question first which teas have

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.429 
easiest question first which teas have
caffeine<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.240> answer<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.799> next<00:01:08.549> question

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
caffeine the answer all do next question

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.100 
caffeine the answer all do next question
actually<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.920> teas<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.640> caffeine<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.450> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
actually all teas have caffeine as this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
actually all teas have caffeine as this
is<00:01:13.290> naturally<00:01:13.740> occurring<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> plant<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is naturally occurring in the plant and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
is naturally occurring in the plant and
all<00:01:15.360> teas<00:01:15.750> come<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> same<00:01:16.619> plant

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
all teas come from the same plant

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.580 
all teas come from the same plant
so<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.090> teas<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.570> caffeine<00:01:19.549> okay<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.970> much

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
so all teas have caffeine okay how much

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
so all teas have caffeine okay how much
this<00:01:22.590> question<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.610> difficult<00:01:23.670> as

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
this question is a bit more difficult as

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
this question is a bit more difficult as
the<00:01:24.570> amount<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.170> caffeine<00:01:25.920> varies<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the amount of caffeine varies with the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.480 
the amount of caffeine varies with the
type<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> tea<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.900> variety<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> plant<00:01:28.860> the

general rule tea has about half or less
the<00:01:37.799> amount<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.220> caffeine<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.750> cup<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
coffee the caffeine and teas is most

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
coffee the caffeine and teas is most
concentrated<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.430> buds<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> young

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
concentrated in the buds and the young

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
concentrated in the buds and the young
leaves<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> plant<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.220> larger<00:01:47.610> leaves

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
leaves of the plant the larger leaves

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
leaves of the plant the larger leaves
and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> stems<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> plant<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.079> much

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and the stems of the plant have much

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.069 
and the stems of the plant have much
less<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.490> teas<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> higher<00:01:51.720> portion

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
less so teas that have a higher portion

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
less so teas that have a higher portion
of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.979> bud<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> tender<00:01:53.729> leaves<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.630> have

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of the bud and tender leaves will have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.679 
of the bud and tender leaves will have
more<00:01:55.049> caffeine<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.850> example<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> finest

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
more caffeine for example the finest

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
more caffeine for example the finest
white<00:01:57.930> teas<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.500> made<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:58.950> buds<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.399> young

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
white teas are made from buds and young

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
white teas are made from buds and young
leaves<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> follows<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.560> more

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
leaves so it follows that they have more

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.819 
leaves so it follows that they have more
caffeine<00:02:02.100> than<00:02:02.579> many<00:02:02.790> other<00:02:03.030> teas<00:02:03.619> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
caffeine than many other teas this is a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.310 
caffeine than many other teas this is a
surprise<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.549> white<00:02:06.030> teas<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> light

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
