00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
holes that penetrate here and also when

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
holes that penetrate here and also when
you<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.229> plug<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.650> soil<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:09.119> water

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you take this plug of soil out the water

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.719 
you take this plug of soil out the water
is<00:01:09.509> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> penetrate<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.290> your<00:01:10.409> lawn<00:01:10.770> to

is going to penetrate into your lawn to
where<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> root<00:01:12.150> zone<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.130> if<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
where the root zone is and if you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.469 
where the root zone is and if you
fertilize<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.790> lawn<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> get

fertilize your lawn it's going to get
into<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> root<00:01:15.990> zone<00:01:16.020> better<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> basically

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
into the root zone better so basically

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
into the root zone better so basically

there's little microscopic organisms
that<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.409> inside<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.040> soil<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.930> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that are inside of this soil here that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
that are inside of this soil here that
will<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.490> soil<00:01:35.729> breaks<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.270> they're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
will as the soil breaks down they're

lawn so it's kind of like a
beneficial<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.120> a<00:01:44.180> few<00:01:44.360> different<00:01:44.690> ways<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
beneficial in a few different ways so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.620 
beneficial in a few different ways so
you're<00:01:45.260> gonna<00:01:46.120> your<00:01:47.120> law<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.360> gonna<00:01:47.540> be

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you're gonna your law is gonna be

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.730 
you're gonna your law is gonna be
greener<00:01:47.900> throughout<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> summer<00:01:48.560> because

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
greener throughout the summer because

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.010 
greener throughout the summer because
the<00:01:49.190> root<00:01:49.640> zone<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:50.030> going<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.270> get<00:01:50.390> nutrients

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
the root zone is going to get nutrients

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.820 
the root zone is going to get nutrients
air<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.100> water<00:01:52.310> better<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.390> as<00:01:54.200> these<00:01:54.380> soil

air and water better and as these soil

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.780 
air and water better and as these soil
plugs<00:01:55.640> break<00:01:56.510> down<00:01:57.010> they're<00:01:58.010> going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.550> feed

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
plugs break down they're going to feed

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.160 
plugs break down they're going to feed
on<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.030> Thacher<00:01:59.240> your<00:01:59.479> lawn<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.050> going

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
same time the only downside is a lot of

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.370 
same time the only downside is a lot of
times<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.729> mow<00:02:08.000> your<00:02:08.030> lawn<00:02:08.360> right<00:02:09.050> after

times if you mow your lawn right after
some<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.679> these<00:02:09.770> are<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.640> sucked<00:02:10.910> up

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
some of these are going to get sucked up

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.810 
some of these are going to get sucked up
in<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.209> mower<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:12.350> some<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.800> them<00:02:12.920> will<00:02:13.130> stay

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
in the mower but some of them will stay

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.390 
in the mower but some of them will stay
on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> lawn<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:16.450> we're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:18.370> show<00:02:19.370> a
