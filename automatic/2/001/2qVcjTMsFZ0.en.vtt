00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.830
 Goodmorning everyone 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.089
 I'm roberto here is another roberto 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 preliminary operations change spring here 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:25.260
 we have an undefined mono not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 we know what what is written 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 diva in writing viva viva monster a little 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.550
 of but should be a divo rr then 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.230
 pro you have to change it spring because I was 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.520
 these nos ate a sheep there 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 chain is a dense look 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.940
 so we need a spring more 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.160
 great 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 this is a 72 we put a 75 what 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.789
 we have here we have another hand 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.789
 all the destination 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 this is where we want to try 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 the mono is an uphill path with 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.640
 of the crisis steps if we want to give the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 maximum information in the ascent then 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.640
 slopes of the land 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.619
 look at what door look state of 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 ground to good football good and good 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.659
 not great another we are the height of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.189
 We are postponing the steps 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 slope of the slope and the stony m 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.659
 hides behind or anything else the set is now 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.659
 possible but we want to measure 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.920
 this is the first step 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.200
 I can't understand why we have to 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.510
 suffer in this way 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.050
 wait wait a moment that arrives at 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.210
 therefore 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 this is the first step that seas 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.410
 more normal than all 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.150
 read how much we have when we have 36 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.150
 an attic that I can't see 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 yes we have about 36 38 80 mt per bubble 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.960
 from 37 and a half still a moment that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.650
 let's check the ok level 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:30.330
 it's called a bubble, yes, but not always 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:30.330
 okay the battleground 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.560
 from here it's all nice smooth is who 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:41.930
 it is that by chance and listen but it will be the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:49.459
 land as I had been of the land and here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:56.409
 in half good you pass chocolate not 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.409
 put well ok let's go ahead Jun 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.560
 the bikes are still there 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.440
 never ever 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.350
 see that the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.850
 climb is bent over to the hoax 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.850
 rip uphill ever 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.040
 which is a show 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.040
 then look at it with a mono ohlins 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.340
 we are back with a bit of work 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.340
 and fork 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:05.020
 or for this effect because this 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.560
 climb and throwing when he died exit 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.150
 rises remains hanged then balances 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.190
 quietly even on the slimy bottom 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.220
 via the compression start again 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.870
 quietly plan excellent salts 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.819
 perfect traction for me is perfect 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.220
 the other mono works first by comparison 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.789
 over straight fact when I arrived 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.400
 up at the top it packs a bit it can too 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.740
 that I could not regulate it 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.509
 or it does not regulate but then it is 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.419
 so complicated i think it takes one 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.349
 scientist here manages to adjust 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:51.080
 great for me very well with a few with 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.210
 you can find a few tricks 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.629
 the right setup 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:00.680
 after the hard they would like a little less 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:04.250
 well exercises have perhaps veni 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.500
 but more I challenge anyone to these 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.199
 conditions and come on stronger gesture 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:16.779
 extreme we will see two lines above one 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:21.199
 moto2 85 kg calves on the bonus of 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:23.770
 to be doing all this same ease 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.770
 I know for what 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.889
 Today I want to see if you are worthy of 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.090
 stop no it does n't stop 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.090
 not even this time 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.650
 but just because of a defect agreement yes 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:22.130
 9 finish a gas tank I 'm here 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.889
 do never stopped precisely because of the excess 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.220
 my mom alone 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:30.650
 maximum had regards maximum glory 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.419
 listen we want to go curia eat 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.940
 something that a family came to me 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:38.900
 her now like taking a steak 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:41.150
 maybe I'll even eat red as a true reminder 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.470
 the money and the usual sheep with a rent 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.650
 chain chain for the Marche region 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:51.729
 subtitled I don't know as a nation 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.729
 let's try eating
