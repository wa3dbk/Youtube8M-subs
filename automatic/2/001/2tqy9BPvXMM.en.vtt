effects<00:00:20.400> well<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.210> he<00:00:21.300> looked<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.600> these

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
effects well when he looked at these

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.630 
effects well when he looked at these
images<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.380> probably<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:24.470> Norwegian

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
images so probably have some Norwegian

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.189 
images so probably have some Norwegian
exclamation<00:00:26.640> he's<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.000> minnesota<00:00:27.150> oh<00:00:27.689> yeah

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
exclamation he's from minnesota oh yeah

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
exclamation he's from minnesota oh yeah
we<00:00:29.130> were<00:00:29.189> worried<00:00:29.369> about<00:00:29.609> his<00:00:30.230> exactly<00:00:32.300> yeah

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
we were worried about his exactly yeah

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
we were worried about his exactly yeah
yeah<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.840> several<00:00:34.440> people<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
yeah I know several people from that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.170 
yeah I know several people from that
part<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> country<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.820> always<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
part of the country they always is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
part of the country they always is
saying<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.719> verbiage<00:00:37.079> seems<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.649> he'll<00:00:38.160> be

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
saying the verbiage seems like he'll be

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240 
saying the verbiage seems like he'll be
a<00:00:38.340> sounded<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.750> amazed<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.500> what's<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
a sounded and amazed at what's going I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.520 
a sounded and amazed at what's going I
would<00:00:41.399> imagine<00:00:41.579> he<00:00:41.850> live<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.960> concerned<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
would imagine he live a bit concerned I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
would imagine he live a bit concerned I
was<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.890> yes<00:00:44.309> yes<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.120> would<00:00:45.270> imagine<00:00:45.450> he

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
was like yes yes I would imagine he

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
was like yes yes I would imagine he
would<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.410> pretty<00:00:46.950> remarkable<00:00:49.969> so

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
would be that's pretty remarkable so

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.279 
would be that's pretty remarkable so
when<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.449> hear<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> you're

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
when you hear about this and you're

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
when you hear about this and you're
looking<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> site<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.789> what

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
looking on the site right now and what

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.729 
looking on the site right now and what
do<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
do you see and what do you think that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.389 
do you see and what do you think that
this<00:00:55.860> means<00:00:56.660> well<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.949> tell<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this means well I have to tell you that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.520 
this means well I have to tell you that
I've<00:00:59.699> been<00:00:59.730> having<00:01:00.270> power<00:01:00.449> fluctuations<00:01:01.320> all

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I've been having power fluctuations all

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
I've been having power fluctuations all
day<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.879> didn't<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.420> eat<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> too

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
day and I didn't know what to eat it too

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.840 
day and I didn't know what to eat it too
but<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:05.010> exactly<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.790> were

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
but now I know exactly what they were

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
but now I know exactly what they were
attributed<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.330> very<00:01:07.140> powerful<00:01:07.590> actuations

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
attributed to very powerful actuations

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.950 
attributed to very powerful actuations
which<00:01:08.189> by<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> way<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.790> blow<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.750> power

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
which by the way can blow out the power

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.420 
which by the way can blow out the power
grid<00:01:10.110> somewhere<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.860> earth<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.310> don't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
grid somewhere on earth and we don't

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
grid somewhere on earth and we don't
know<00:01:11.640> where<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.930> I'm<00:01:13.080> sure<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
know where it will be but I'm sure that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
know where it will be but I'm sure that
the<00:01:13.650> power<00:01:13.830> stations<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.490> companies<00:01:14.820> are

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the power stations and companies are

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.219 
the power stations and companies are
doing<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.240> kinds<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.960> keep<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
doing all kinds of things to keep the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.450 
doing all kinds of things to keep the
power<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> background<00:01:16.920> grid<00:01:17.310> because

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
power on the background grid because

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
power on the background grid because
these<00:01:18.270> fields<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.840> inductive<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> power

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
these fields are inductive to the power

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
these fields are inductive to the power
grid<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:21.119> they're<00:01:21.240> reductive<00:01:21.689> they

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
grid and because they're reductive they

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
grid and because they're reductive they
can<00:01:21.960> also<00:01:22.110> change<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> peril<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> grid<00:01:23.580> or

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
can also change the peril on the grid or

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
can also change the peril on the grid or
change<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> phase<00:01:24.479> most<00:01:25.290> people<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.560> right

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
change the phase most people are right

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.679 
change the phase most people are right
where<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> maintain<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
where this but you have to maintain the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
where this but you have to maintain the
phase<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> alternating<00:01:29.100> current<00:01:29.369> along

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
phase of the alternating current along

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
phase of the alternating current along
the<00:01:29.670> grid<00:01:29.850> otherwise<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.450> blows<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:32.810> yeah<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the grid otherwise it blows it yeah and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840 
the grid otherwise it blows it yeah and
I<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.950> you're<00:01:35.130> observant<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I think that if you're observant you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.580 
I think that if you're observant you
when<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.240> notice<00:01:36.420> things<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.320> then

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
when you notice things like that then

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
when you notice things like that then
you<00:01:37.710> probably<00:01:37.950> ought<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> hat<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.000> if

you probably ought to put a hat on if

you probably ought to put a hat on if
you<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.479> outside<00:01:40.549> which<00:01:41.549> means<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.060> you're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you go outside which means that you're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.480 
you go outside which means that you're

increased ultraviolet light because it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.530

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
earthquake because they're detecting

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.380 
earthquake because they're detecting
these<00:03:22.209> flux<00:03:22.480> line<00:03:23.160> rapid<00:03:24.160> changes<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
these flux line rapid changes and the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
these flux line rapid changes and the
animals<00:03:25.780> start<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.109> get<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.290> agitated<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
animals start to get very agitated and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.460 
animals start to get very agitated and
don't<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.489> what's<00:03:27.640> going<00:03:27.880> on<00:03:28.000> or<00:03:28.150> they

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
don't know what's going on or they

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.410 
don't know what's going on or they
miscalculate<00:03:29.470> distances<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.250> they<00:03:31.180> don't

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
miscalculate distances and they don't

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.610 
miscalculate distances and they don't
their<00:03:31.660> flight<00:03:31.840> patterns<00:03:32.230> are<00:03:32.350> messed<00:03:32.380> up

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
their flight patterns are messed up

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.930 
their flight patterns are messed up
because<00:03:32.739> they<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.130> magnetite<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.819> they

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
because they have magnetite that they

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.599 
because they have magnetite that they
use<00:03:34.060> birds<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.959> ocean-going<00:03:35.609> creatures

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
use birds and the ocean-going creatures

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.809 
use birds and the ocean-going creatures
use<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.970> navigate<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.660> bees<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.819> these

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
use to navigate and bees so these

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819 
use to navigate and bees so these
changes<00:03:40.510> are<00:03:40.540> affect<00:03:41.109> these<00:03:41.230> animals<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.799> they

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
changes are affect these animals so they

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.030 
changes are affect these animals so they
get<00:03:42.010> they<00:03:42.280> lose<00:03:42.459> their<00:03:42.609> orientation<00:03:43.920> yeah<00:03:44.920> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
get they lose their orientation yeah and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.650 
get they lose their orientation yeah and
I<00:03:45.160> think<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.549> you'll<00:03:45.730> find<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.180> people<00:03:46.389> of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
I think that you'll find that people of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.629 
I think that you'll find that people of
the<00:03:46.750> higher<00:03:46.959> altitudes<00:03:47.739> will<00:03:48.069> be<00:03:48.190> affected

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
the higher altitudes will be affected

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.960 
the higher altitudes will be affected
more<00:03:48.790> than<00:03:48.850> people<00:03:49.329> at<00:03:49.540> sea<00:03:49.900> level<00:03:50.049> well<00:03:51.040> any

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
more than people at sea level well any

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.270 
more than people at sea level well any

much tell you what's happening with the
bees<00:04:32.870> all<00:04:33.259> these<00:04:33.440> people<00:04:33.620> trying<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.009> figure

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
bees all these people trying to figure

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.920 
bees all these people trying to figure
out<00:04:34.340> why<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.520> bees<00:04:34.789> are<00:04:34.819> disappearing<00:04:35.060> well

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
out why the bees are disappearing well

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.749 
out why the bees are disappearing well
bees<00:04:36.169> navigate<00:04:36.800> through<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.340> Sun<00:04:37.580> and

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
bees navigate through the Sun and

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.580 
bees navigate through the Sun and
through<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.030> magnetic<00:04:38.360> field<00:04:38.780> exactly<00:04:39.470> well

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
through the magnetic field exactly well

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.320 
through the magnetic field exactly well
they're<00:04:39.740> not<00:04:39.770> sighted<00:04:40.340> they're<00:04:40.759> not<00:04:40.909> finding

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
they're not sighted they're not finding

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.390 
they're not sighted they're not finding
any<00:04:41.449> be<00:04:41.720> carcasses<00:04:42.440> at<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.830> nest<00:04:43.099> because

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
any be carcasses at the nest because

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.879 
any be carcasses at the nest because
what's<00:04:43.759> happening<00:04:43.849> is<00:04:44.389> Abby<00:04:45.080> has<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.319> very<00:04:45.680> high

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
what's happening is Abby has a very high

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.640 
what's happening is Abby has a very high
metabolism<00:04:46.699> beige<00:04:47.000> sugar<00:04:47.449> if<00:04:47.780> they<00:04:48.169> don't<00:04:48.409> eat

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
metabolism beige sugar if they don't eat

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.499 
metabolism beige sugar if they don't eat
every<00:04:49.009> single<00:04:49.370> day<00:04:49.580> they<00:04:49.940> die<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.240> starvation

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
every single day they die of starvation

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.390 
every single day they die of starvation
so<00:04:51.319> what's<00:04:51.500> happening<00:04:51.919> is<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:52.159> bees<00:04:52.370> are

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
so what's happening is the bees are

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.490 
so what's happening is the bees are
leaving<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> nest<00:04:53.270> they're<00:04:53.930> getting<00:04:54.259> lost

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
leaving the nest they're getting lost

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.990 
leaving the nest they're getting lost
and<00:04:54.949> they're<00:04:55.099> not<00:04:55.219> finding<00:04:55.699> their<00:04:55.819> way<00:04:55.849> back

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and they're not finding their way back

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.640 
and they're not finding their way back
to<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.569> source<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:57.020> food<00:04:57.199> and<00:04:57.530> they're

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
to the source of food and they're

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.230 
to the source of food and they're
starving<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.250> death<00:04:58.280> that's<00:04:58.639> why<00:04:58.819> nobody's

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
starving to death that's why nobody's

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.510 
starving to death that's why nobody's
finding<00:04:59.539> any<00:04:59.840> dead<00:05:00.110> need<00:05:00.319> at<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.590> dead<00:05:00.770> right

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
finding any dead need at the dead right
