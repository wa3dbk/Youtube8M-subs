00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.300
 do not 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.690
 Welcome to this terrifying crit and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690
 pasta 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.220
 wheat 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.400
 Was born dead 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.390
 this story begins in North jameson 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.759
 a cold and dark place where trevor 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.640
 a psychopath with existential problems 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.890
 was born one night in October although the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.500
 only problem is that he was born dead 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.480
 after that night something strange happened a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.339
 strange symptom was contagious to the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
 people who had ever passed 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.300
 out there michael townley one of the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.129
 first people infected by the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 symptom which consisted in seeing 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 trevor in its adult form which you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.320
 would kill after a while doing 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.150
 that you commit suicide 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 michael interpreted the words of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.620
 clover 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.470
 since he did not say anything really and without 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.080
 know this michael befriended 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.050
 Shamrock not being afraid of him was what 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.470
 saved even the one who was not so lucky 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.420
 a motorcyclist named don johnny was 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 schizophrenic so the symptom was 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619
 stronger in him unlike michael 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.630
 I was not a friend of Trevor and always 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.750
 I was looking for this nonexistent being 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.550
 but trevor always ignored me or not 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 I endure this situation more and I try 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.360
 killed brutally making me not even know 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.040
 hang himself and then break 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.170
 a glass bottle fracturing the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.540
 skull and that's how he died bleeding 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 in the middle of nowhere they tried to help him 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.320
 but it was too late 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.050
 after that all his friends cried 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.119
 for him and so it was like clover who had 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.220
 born dead he took his first 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560
 victim 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.070
 forgotten 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 do not 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.680
 and after that we have became 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
 a billionaire founding his own 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.049
 and security company trucks and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.930
 well it would also have happened if not 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.860
 I was born dead 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 forever
