lower as well that's going to give us
access<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.329> bottom<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> frame<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.379> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
access to the bottom of the frame so we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
access to the bottom of the frame so we
can<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.649> our<00:00:43.739> hitch<00:00:43.860> installed<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.879> want

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can get our hitch installed so we want

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
can get our hitch installed so we want
to<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.149> ahead<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> first<00:00:46.079> time<00:00:46.280> okay<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to go ahead do that first time okay to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
to go ahead do that first time okay to
easing<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> removal<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> rubber<00:00:48.780> hangers

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
easing the removal of the rubber hangers

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.490 
easing the removal of the rubber hangers
from<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> studs<00:00:50.160> definitely<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.539> looking

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
from the studs definitely you go looking

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.779 
from the studs definitely you go looking
for<00:00:52.680> take<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
for take them up with some kind of a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
for take them up with some kind of a
spray<00:00:54.030> lubricant<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> wd-40<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> make

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
spray lubricant like a wd-40 and make

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
spray lubricant like a wd-40 and make
the<00:00:56.969> removal<00:00:57.930> much<00:00:58.350> easier<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.129> our

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the removal much easier and you see our

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
the removal much easier and you see our
exhaust<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> lowered<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.180> bit<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.660> two

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
exhaust is lowered a little bit the two

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.539 
exhaust is lowered a little bit the two
hangers<00:01:04.409> removed<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.949> filming<00:01:05.309> purposes

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
hangers removed for filming purposes

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
hangers removed for filming purposes
I've<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.060> ahead<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> remove<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> exhaust<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
I've got ahead and remove the exhaust so

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
I've got ahead and remove the exhaust so
it's<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:07.979> better<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.700> essentially

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's a little bit better but essentially

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's a little bit better but essentially
the<00:01:10.170> two<00:01:10.320> mounting<00:01:10.619> points<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> hitch

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the two mounting points for the hitch

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
the two mounting points for the hitch
are<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.869> behind<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.140> plug<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
are going to be behind this plug and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.640 
are going to be behind this plug and
this<00:01:14.369> ploy<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:15.380> we're<00:01:16.380> gonna<00:01:16.470> actually

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
this ploy as well we're gonna actually

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.550 
this ploy as well we're gonna actually
fish<00:01:17.009> bolts<00:01:17.820> into<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> frame<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.170> pull<00:01:19.409> them

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fish bolts into the frame and pull them

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.510 
fish bolts into the frame and pull them
down<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.280> each<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.610> those<00:01:20.700> locations<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> we're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
down in each of those locations so we're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.770 
down in each of those locations so we're
in<00:01:23.580> order<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> hitch<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> sit<00:01:24.330> flat<00:01:24.570> at

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
in order for the hitch to sit flat at

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
in order for the hitch to sit flat at
the<00:01:24.840> bottom<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.200> frame<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:26.340> need<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> go

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the bottom of the frame we need to go

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
the bottom of the frame we need to go
ahead<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.030> remove<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.540> forward<00:01:27.930> most<00:01:28.080> screw

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
ahead and remove this forward most screw

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
ahead and remove this forward most screw
here<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> bottom<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> frame<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.939> both

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here at the bottom of the frame on both

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.720 
here at the bottom of the frame on both
sides<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> vehicle

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
sides of the vehicle

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.590 
sides of the vehicle
then<00:01:33.730> after<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.090> we're<00:01:34.270> going<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> remove

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
then after that we're going to remove

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.890 
then after that we're going to remove
both<00:01:34.780> plugs<00:01:35.280> from<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.460> frame<00:01:36.670> rail<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.120> again

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
both plugs from the frame rail and again
those<00:01:38.050> are<00:01:38.080> going<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.380> provide<00:01:38.530> bar<00:01:39.070> to

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
those are going to provide bar to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.490 
those are going to provide bar to
attachment<00:01:40.360> points<00:01:40.600> for<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.810> hitch<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.290> order

are going to need to do some drilling

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.800 
are going to need to do some drilling
we're<00:01:45.100> going<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.280> actually<00:01:45.550> drill<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:46.030> 3/8<00:01:46.630> inch

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
we're going to actually drill a 3/8 inch

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.620 
we're going to actually drill a 3/8 inch
hole<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.710> this<00:01:47.890> side<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.940> on<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.330> side<00:01:49.390> as

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
hole on this side and on this side as

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.020 
hole on this side and on this side as
well<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:51.070> shows<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.340> lot<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.640> difference

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
well and it shows a lot the difference

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.700 
well and it shows a lot the difference
and<00:01:52.690> that's<00:01:52.900> going<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.140> make<00:01:53.260> a<00:01:53.290> large<00:01:53.530> enough

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
and that's going to make a large enough

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.680 
and that's going to make a large enough
hole<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.220> for<00:01:54.670> us<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.850> get<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.090> block<00:01:55.330> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
hole for it for us to get the block and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.290 
hole for it for us to get the block and
the<00:01:56.260> carriage<00:01:56.440> bolt<00:01:56.740> inside<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.310> frame<00:01:57.580> so

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
the carriage bolt inside the frame so

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.520 
the carriage bolt inside the frame so
that's<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.870> next<00:01:59.050> thing<00:01:59.170> we're<00:01:59.260> going<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.410> do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
that's the next thing we're going to do

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.830 
that's the next thing we're going to do
go<00:02:00.490> ahead<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.700> drill<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> 3/8<00:02:01.270> inch<00:02:01.450> hole<00:02:01.690> on

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
go ahead to drill a 3/8 inch hole on

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.690 
go ahead to drill a 3/8 inch hole on
each<00:02:01.960> side<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.770> chisel<00:02:03.130> out<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.340> difference

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
each side and chisel out the difference

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.550 
each side and chisel out the difference
and<00:02:04.270> then<00:02:04.660> we'll<00:02:04.780> fish<00:02:04.930> our<00:02:05.050> hardware<00:02:05.380> into

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
and then we'll fish our hardware into

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:24.720 
and then we'll fish our hardware into
the<00:02:05.590> frame

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.280 

on<00:02:25.730> some<00:02:25.940> instances<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.660> may<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.900> able<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.170> get

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
on some instances you may be able to get

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
on some instances you may be able to get
away<00:02:27.380> with<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.620> really<00:02:27.830> one<00:02:28.130> whole<00:02:28.310> one

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
away with just really one whole one

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.450 
away with just really one whole one
three<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.810> each<00:02:30.050> side<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.400> it

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
three and so on on each side so it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.530 
three and so on on each side so it
wouldn't<00:02:31.700> hurt<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.880> check<00:02:31.970> after<00:02:32.330> you've

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
wouldn't hurt to check after you've

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.630 
wouldn't hurt to check after you've
drawn<00:02:32.750> your<00:02:32.900> first<00:02:33.110> hole<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:33.710> I<00:02:33.860> have<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.490> see

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
drawn your first hole like I have to see

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.580 
drawn your first hole like I have to see
if<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> heart<00:02:34.940> bro<00:02:35.090> go<00:02:35.240> ahead<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.450> fit<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
if the heart bro go ahead and fit and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.520 
if the heart bro go ahead and fit and
you<00:02:37.460> know<00:02:37.580> since<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.060> real<00:02:38.410> bolt<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you know since it's a real bolt the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.100 
you know since it's a real bolt the
block<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.850> carriage<00:02:41.000> bolt<00:02:41.330> hold<00:02:41.780> sit<00:02:42.020> in

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
block and the carriage bolt hold sit in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.450 
block and the carriage bolt hold sit in
the<00:02:42.170> hole<00:02:42.320> so<00:02:42.740> there's<00:02:42.950> no<00:02:43.010> need<00:02:43.190> for<00:02:43.250> me<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
the hole so there's no need for me to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.600 
the hole so there's no need for me to
drill<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> second<00:02:44.060> hole<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.390> other<00:02:44.450> side

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
drill the second hole on the other side

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.950 
drill the second hole on the other side
so<00:02:46.610> I'm<00:02:47.180> gonna<00:02:47.270> go<00:02:47.390> ahead<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.630> drill<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> hole

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
so I'm gonna go ahead and drill the hole

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.300 
so I'm gonna go ahead and drill the hole
on<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.260> other<00:02:48.380> side<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:48.740> well<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:48.920> check-in

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.800 
on the other side as well and check-in
it<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.940> then<00:02:50.120> we'll<00:02:50.210> go<00:02:50.330> ahead<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.480> fish<00:02:50.690> our

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
it and then we'll go ahead and fish our

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.210 
it and then we'll go ahead and fish our
bolts<00:02:51.050> through<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.230> frame<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.709> next<00:02:54.920> step<00:02:55.070> is

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
bolts through the frame the next step is

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.600 
bolts through the frame the next step is
to<00:02:55.370> fix<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.790> bolts<00:02:56.030> into<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.300> frame<00:02:56.950> what<00:02:57.950> go

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
to fix the bolts into the frame what go

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.500 
to fix the bolts into the frame what go
ahead<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.790> note<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.180> there<00:02:59.300> are<00:02:59.330> two

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
back down you also want to note that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.590 
back down you also want to note that
there<00:03:22.220> are<00:03:22.400> again<00:03:22.910> two<00:03:23.150> different<00:03:23.270> size

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
there are again two different size

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.170 
there are again two different size
blocks<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.140> well<00:03:24.430> there<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.550> half-inch<00:03:25.910> size

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
blocks as well there is a half-inch size

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.699 
blocks as well there is a half-inch size
and<00:03:27.080> then<00:03:27.470> there's<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> 7/16<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:30.170> may<00:03:30.290> want<00:03:30.650> to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
and then there's a 7/16 you may want to

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.040 
and then there's a 7/16 you may want to
make<00:03:30.830> sure<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:31.220> get<00:03:31.370> those<00:03:32.050> put

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
make sure that you get those put

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.630 
make sure that you get those put
together<00:03:33.170> appropriately<00:03:33.890> otherwise<00:03:34.370> you'll

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
together appropriately otherwise you'll

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.280 
together appropriately otherwise you'll
have<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:35.000> bad<00:03:35.209> combination<00:03:35.510> for<00:03:35.930> something

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
have a bad combination for something

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.220 
have a bad combination for something
there<00:03:36.860> are<00:03:37.010> also<00:03:37.130> different<00:03:37.850> size<00:03:38.000> fish<00:03:38.989> wires

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
there are also different size fish wires

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.479 
there are also different size fish wires
we're<00:03:39.590> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.769> use<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.040> fish<00:03:40.190> into<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489
