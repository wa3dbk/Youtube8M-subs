from shoes on obviously I am quite
skinny<00:00:32.930> on<00:00:33.930> help<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.350> way<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> want

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
skinny on help it's way down but I want

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700

to<00:00:36.360> give<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:36.750> sort<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> idea<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.559> I

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to give you some sort of idea of what I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240 
to give you some sort of idea of what I
measure<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.230> relate<00:00:40.590> when

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
measure so but you can then relate when

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
measure so but you can then relate when
I<00:00:41.340> try<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:41.850> boots<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.719> relate<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I try these boots on you can relate to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
I try these boots on you can relate to
how<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> might<00:00:44.070> fit<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> important<00:00:45.960> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
how it might fit you so it's important I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
how it might fit you so it's important I
think<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.620> able<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> measure<00:00:47.070> yourself<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
think to be able to measure yourself so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.279 
think to be able to measure yourself so
you<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> good<00:00:48.360> idea<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.960> some

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you get a good idea because some

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.470 
you get a good idea because some
websites<00:00:49.770> might<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.850> able<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.120> give<00:00:51.270> some

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
websites might be able to give some

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
websites might be able to give some
information<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.680> circumference<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
information on the circumference of the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
information on the circumference of the
leg<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.969> sort<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> thing<00:00:54.750> while<00:00:55.350> you're

doing this so you can actually see the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.149

and measure that off you don't need to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210 
and measure that off you don't need to
pull<00:01:15.720> tight<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.140> anything<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:17.189> that

pull tight or anything like that on that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
pull tight or anything like that on that
bit<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> should<00:01:18.060> say<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.450> manager<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> 29

bit I should say at manager of 29
centimeters<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.290> biggest

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
centimeters you then take the biggest

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.859 
centimeters you then take the biggest
fullest<00:01:23.369> part<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.880> life<00:01:24.030> again<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a good place to sort of start looking in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
a good place to sort of start looking in
the<00:01:26.460> mirror<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.750> whether<00:01:27.930> for

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the mirror so you can see whether for

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.390 
the mirror so you can see whether for
this<00:01:28.290> part<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.979> leg<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.549> mine<00:01:30.509> somewhere

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
this part but leg is mine somewhere

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.090 
this part but leg is mine somewhere
they're<00:01:32.260> on<00:01:33.260> centimeters<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:35.620> again<00:01:36.620> we<00:01:36.890> take

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
they're on centimeters and again we take

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.780 
they're on centimeters and again we take
it<00:01:37.340> there<00:01:37.580> I<00:01:37.820> am<00:01:38.530> 31<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.070> half<00:01:40.280> centimeters

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
it there I am 31 and a half centimeters

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.820 
it there I am 31 and a half centimeters
then<00:01:43.790> again<00:01:44.450> take<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.050> ankle<00:01:45.200> because

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
then again take the ankle because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.920 
then again take the ankle because
surprising<00:01:46.490> how<00:01:46.640> many<00:01:46.820> times<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.570> think<00:01:47.720> it

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
surprising how many times I think it

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.300 
surprising how many times I think it
could<00:01:48.110> be<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.410> really<00:01:48.560> well<00:01:48.830> here

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
could be you really well here

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.310 
could be you really well here
but<00:01:49.640> then<00:01:49.790> it's<00:01:49.970> really<00:01:50.090> badly<00:01:50.630> on<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.960> ankle

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
but then it's really badly on the ankle

I'm as you can see I've got plenty of
space<00:06:26.390> there<00:06:28.090> pull<00:06:29.090> that<00:06:29.210> over<00:06:29.560> so<00:06:30.560> it<00:06:30.680> is<00:06:30.770> a

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
space there pull that over so it is a

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:46.030 
space there pull that over so it is a
bit<00:06:31.010> on<00:06:31.100> the<00:06:31.160> big<00:06:31.280> side<00:06:31.870> for<00:06:32.870> me
