aunt Hawthorne here will answer a quick
question<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.590> question<00:00:11.070> was<00:00:12.740> what<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.890> my

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
question the question was what is my

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.859 
question the question was what is my
programming<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.059> do<00:00:15.210> i<00:00:15.420> program<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:17.869> do

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
programming and how do i program I do

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.480 
programming and how do i program I do
have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.200> lot<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> different<00:00:19.830> views<00:00:20.039> from<00:00:20.190> a<00:00:20.340> lot

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
have a lot of different views from a lot

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.439 
have a lot of different views from a lot
of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> powerlifters<00:00:22.520> my<00:00:23.520> programming<00:00:24.270> is

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of the powerlifters my programming is

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.260 
of the powerlifters my programming is
usual<00:00:25.039> usually<00:00:26.039> eight<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.570> ten<00:00:28.289> weeks<00:00:28.320> long

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
usual usually eight to ten weeks long

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.309 
usual usually eight to ten weeks long
and<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.969> simple

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:34.319 
and it's very simple

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.989 
and it's very simple
I<00:00:34.489> start<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.699> my<00:00:36.420> training<00:00:36.929> my<00:00:37.469> training<00:00:37.999> cycle

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
I start my my training my training cycle

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.520 
I start my my training my training cycle
with<00:00:39.319> 10<00:00:40.319> teams<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.460> 10<00:00:41.850> sets<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> 10<00:00:42.479> all<00:00:43.050> three

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
with 10 teams so 10 sets of 10 all three

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
with 10 teams so 10 sets of 10 all three
lifts<00:00:43.999> I<00:00:45.559> don't<00:00:46.559> go<00:00:46.679> by<00:00:46.859> percentages<00:00:47.519> so<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.479> go

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lifts I don't go by percentages so I go

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.729 
lifts I don't go by percentages so I go
from<00:00:49.229> 10<00:00:50.069> tens<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> second<00:00:51.510> week<00:00:51.659> being<00:00:51.989> 4

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
from 10 tens to the second week being 4

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
from 10 tens to the second week being 4
sets<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> 8<00:00:53.339> the<00:00:53.879> third<00:00:54.179> week<00:00:54.479> also<00:00:54.780> being<00:00:55.289> 4

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sets of 8 the third week also being 4

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.340 
sets of 8 the third week also being 4
set<00:00:55.859> to<00:00:55.979> 8<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.620> fourth<00:00:58.620> week<00:00:58.979> would<00:00:59.489> be<00:01:00.109> 3<00:01:01.109> sets

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
set to 8 the fourth week would be 3 sets

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
set to 8 the fourth week would be 3 sets
of<00:01:01.499> 6<00:01:02.359> then<00:01:03.359> 3<00:01:03.839> sets<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> threes<00:01:04.880> three<00:01:05.880> sets<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
of 6 then 3 sets of threes three sets of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.150 
of 6 then 3 sets of threes three sets of
six<00:01:06.530> three<00:01:07.530> sets<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> threes<00:01:08.960> then<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.410> have<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
six three sets of threes then I have a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.520 
six three sets of threes then I have a
opening<00:01:12.150> opener<00:01:12.960> week<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.120> then<00:01:15.120> I'll<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
opening opener week and then I'll have a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.460 
opening opener week and then I'll have a
about<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> week<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.730> half<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.420> weeks

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
about a week and a half to two weeks

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.720 
about a week and a half to two weeks
rest<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.800> then<00:01:20.160> I'll<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:21.350> meat

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
rest and then I'll have the meat

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.660 
rest and then I'll have the meat
like<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.570> said<00:01:25.400> gradually<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:29.340> start

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like I said gradually going up you start

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
like I said gradually going up you start
off<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.210> reps<00:01:30.710> more<00:01:31.710> sets<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.080> then<00:01:34.080> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
off with more reps more sets and then it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.040 
off with more reps more sets and then it
just<00:01:34.800> trickled<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:38.390> 230<00:01:39.390> sets<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:39.810> six

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
just trickled on down to 230 sets of six

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.110 
just trickled on down to 230 sets of six
and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:41.010> three<00:01:41.220> sets<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.550> three<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.940> going

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
and then three sets of three is going

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.810 
and then three sets of three is going
back<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> forth<00:01:43.340> climbing<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> weight

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
back and forth climbing up and weight

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.950 
back and forth climbing up and weight
each<00:01:45.090> week<00:01:47.300> that's<00:01:48.300> pretty<00:01:48.570> much<00:01:48.750> my

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
each week that's pretty much my

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.060 
each week that's pretty much my
programming

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
programming

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.860 
programming
I<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.640> by<00:01:50.820> feel<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.540> train<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.630> no

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
I go by feel when I train so so as no

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.920 
I go by feel when I train so so as no
percentages<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:56.360> just<00:01:57.360> depending<00:01:57.900> on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
percentages in there just depending on

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.880 
percentages in there just depending on
how<00:01:58.560> Mondego<00:01:59.659> how<00:02:00.659> my<00:02:01.020> eating<00:02:01.350> goes<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.890> just

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
how Mondego how my eating goes and just

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.059 
how Mondego how my eating goes and just
from<00:02:05.490> set<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.180> set<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.840> reps<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.440> rep<00:02:07.710> I'll

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
from set to set or reps a rep I'll

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.110 
from set to set or reps a rep I'll
choose<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.659> my<00:02:09.659> weight<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:10.649> simple<00:02:11.249> I<00:02:11.400> find

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
choose my my weight very simple I find

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.920 
choose my my weight very simple I find
it<00:02:12.389> very

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
it very

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.069 
it very
very<00:02:13.019> very<00:02:13.700> very<00:02:15.920> very<00:02:17.000> successful<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
very very very very successful for the

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.970 
very very very very successful for the
past<00:02:20.209> I'll<00:02:21.209> say<00:02:21.569> past<00:02:21.989> ten<00:02:22.379> years<00:02:22.409> I've<00:02:22.950> been

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
past I'll say past ten years I've been

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.759 
past I'll say past ten years I've been
on<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.340> same<00:02:23.549> program<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:27.359> said<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.870> go

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
on the same program so like I said I go

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.119 
on the same program so like I said I go
from<00:02:29.549> anywhere<00:02:30.030> between<00:02:30.269> eight<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.319> ten<00:02:31.829> weeks

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
from anywhere between eight to ten weeks

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.459 
from anywhere between eight to ten weeks
and<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:33.030> depends<00:02:33.389> on<00:02:33.569> how<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:33.989> rest<00:02:34.319> I

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
and that just depends on how much rest I

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.970 
and that just depends on how much rest I
want<00:02:34.709> before<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.219> actual<00:02:35.639> meet<00:02:35.909> so<00:02:36.680> that's<00:02:37.680> my

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
want before the actual meet so that's my

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.940 
want before the actual meet so that's my
programming<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:40.469> have<00:02:40.620> any<00:02:40.829> more

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
programming and if you have any more

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.739 
programming and if you have any more
questions<00:02:41.159> about<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:42.409> give<00:02:43.409> me<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> holler
