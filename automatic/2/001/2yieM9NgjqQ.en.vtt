00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.449
 Kowa Temzac at the Tokyo Motor Show 2011 

00:00:06.449 --> 00:00:08.380
 Electric car concept model 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.900
 We announced "KOBOT (Cobot)" 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.450
 The one-seater was announced 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.599
 With "KOBOT ((Cobot New)" 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:15.940
 "KOBOT beta (Cobot beta)" 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 In two models of "KOBOTπ (Cobot pie)" 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 One-seater KOBOT と and β are for smartphones 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.730
 Has the ability to deform in operation 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.079
 The chair is folded and the wheel base is shrunk 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.150
 The part of the panel is hidden 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 Thinking about security 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.409
 Such a concept 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.050
 Let me express a little 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.509
 About 30 cm in green (KOBOT β) 

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:40.569
 The wheel base shrinks about 30 cm 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.409
 About 40 cm in red (KOBOT)) 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.500
 The wheel base is in a shrinking shape 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.780
 Kowa Temzac is a pharmaceutical manufacturer 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.359
 Kowa and Temzac of robot maker 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.909
 In a new company created jointly 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.050
 It will be entry from different industries 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.939
 Instead of developing only the hard of the vehicle 

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.649
 Car sharing etc. in town 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.789
 We also propose how to use it 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.750
 I have no intention of making cars for intercity traffic 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.400
 A little shopping or something in the city 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 Outpatients of elderly people 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.340
 In such a city 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 In an image like a choy ride 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 I am designing a car 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.010
 When saving the parking space 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.770
 It will be compact 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.180
 This is also considered car sharing 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.750
 Put as many cars as possible in a small space 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.080
 One thing that you need to stop 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 Then one more thing 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560
 I'm thinking of "pedestrian mode" 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.040
 In this show in pedestrian mode 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.820
 I am allowed to exhibit 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 Because you need to coexist with the pedestrian a little 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 A mode that allows you to run well at slow speeds 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.880
 Then "run mode" 30 km out 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.390
 In the three that run by running 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.540
 Once a transformer bull shape 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.500
 I imagined and started designing 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.550
 If possible, we are also from different industries 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.020
 Partnership with several different companies 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.010
 I also think that I want to assemble 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.160
 So for those partners 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.909
 Have a look and get an opinion 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:11.939
 Such a partner if possible 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.400
 I think that I want to find 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.479
 Somehow as a goal in the fall of next year 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.809
 Let me announce the first release model 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.889
 I think that I want to receive
