00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.920 
really kind of evaluate the best ideas
from<00:00:50.380> all<00:00:50.829> of<00:00:50.980> our<00:00:51.130> talent<00:00:51.579> around<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.180> world

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.970 

it's<00:00:56.470> a<00:00:56.530> very<00:00:56.710> competitive<00:00:57.070> marketplace<00:00:57.670> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it's a very competitive marketplace and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.560 
it's a very competitive marketplace and
of<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.130> automobiles<00:01:00.640> just<00:01:01.060> it's<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.360> major

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
of the automobiles just it's a major

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.990 
of the automobiles just it's a major
part<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:02.050> culture<00:01:02.650> so<00:01:03.130> I<00:01:03.160> think<00:01:03.310> there's<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.700> lot

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
part of culture so I think there's a lot

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.020 
part of culture so I think there's a lot
at<00:01:04.180> stake<00:01:04.410> when<00:01:05.410> you<00:01:05.530> discuss<00:01:06.040> what<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> vehicle

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
at stake when you discuss what a vehicle

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.280 
at stake when you discuss what a vehicle
is<00:01:07.090> going<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.360> look<00:01:07.510> like<00:01:07.540> for<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> particular

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290
