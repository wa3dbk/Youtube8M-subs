00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
much more I never say small I call it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
much more I never say small I call it
compact<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> different<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> thinking

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110

compact it's a different way of thinking
about<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.309> start<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.969> focused<00:00:48.210> rim

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
about it we start on a more focused rim

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.470 
about it we start on a more focused rim
like<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> 7<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> 5<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.340> again<00:00:51.030> using<00:00:51.300> Bach

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480

numbers as a general rule and young
players<00:00:55.140> feel<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.340> order

to<00:00:56.610> really<00:00:56.789> evolve<00:00:57.120> end<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.660> playing<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> big

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

true<00:01:00.449> professionals<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.219> there's

I'm<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.500> telling<00:01:07.860> people<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.240> play

I'm not telling people you have to play
something<00:01:09.900> smaller<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.530> am<00:01:11.070> saying<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.820> can

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
something smaller I am saying you can

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
something smaller I am saying you can
play<00:01:12.930> something<00:01:13.200> smaller

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
play something smaller

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.070 
play something smaller
it's<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.549> choice<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.299> let<00:01:15.509> anybody

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's your choice and don't let anybody

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
tell you otherwise and as a result I'm

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
tell you otherwise and as a result I'm
very<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.110> fond<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:20.700> working<00:01:21.150> with

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
very very fond of of working with

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.789 
very very fond of of working with
students<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> hear<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:24.799> more

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
students when I hear that there's more

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.429 
students when I hear that there's more
effort<00:01:26.250> needed<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.060> playing<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> trumpet

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
effort needed in playing the trumpet

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
effort needed in playing the trumpet
specifically<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.520> say<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> g'<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
specifically from say a g' on top of the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
specifically from say a g' on top of the
treble<00:01:30.900> clef<00:01:31.020> staff<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.130> they're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
treble clef staff and up if they're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.370 
treble clef staff and up if they're
working<00:01:33.060> harder<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.780> they<00:01:34.110> need<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
working harder than I think they need to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
working harder than I think they need to
be<00:01:34.590> working<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.640> tend<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> scale<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
be working we tend to scale it back and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
be working we tend to scale it back and
nine<00:01:37.020> times<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.530> 10<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> comes

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
nine times out of 10 what that comes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.840 
nine times out of 10 what that comes
down<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> size<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> mouthpiece<00:01:40.229> so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
down to is the size of the mouthpiece so

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.480 
down to is the size of the mouthpiece so
I<00:01:41.850> encourage<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.110> compact<00:01:43.619> rim<00:01:43.920> size<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I encourage a more compact rim size and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
I encourage a more compact rim size and
then<00:01:44.610> messing<00:01:44.909> around<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> cup<00:01:45.509> depth

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
then messing around with the cup depth
