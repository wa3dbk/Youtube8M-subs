00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.700
 the most common causes of 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.710
 overheating of the engines 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 to the lack of water circulation by the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 circuit or lack of refrigeration 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.320
 around 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 of the circuit water then several 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.610
 several various types of failures but 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.070
 we can correct 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.830
 making sure that the grids that 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.560
 we have in the front radiator that 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.630
 is in this case inside this case 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.460
 be 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 completely uncovered these are going 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.590
 clogging because of for example 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.050
 small particles in suspension of 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.380
 leafy mosquitoes that are staying 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.379
 in the fan grilles this creates 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.059
 generates a wall therefore the water the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 air can not circulate through it 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.220
 then the temperature increases 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.560
 automatically 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.630
 it is advisable from time to time I could 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.370
 use the grid with pressurized water 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.790
 of the activator to avoid this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.670
 to avoid this problem another of the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.880
 causes is that we say interrupted the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.070
 water circulation 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 [Music] 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 I can see the causes of the water 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.320
 it is decomposing the circuit 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.140
 closed 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 the thermostat he got stuck 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.180
 have a malfunction therefore 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 in the circular increases the temperature 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.210
 of the water or even 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
 that we have some kind of problems in 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.369
 the water pump 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.610
 by the internal part of the pump that is 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.820
 the thrust or the rifling that this 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.340
 It is defective and does not rotate in tune 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.439
 with the rotation of the water pump 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 to be able to avoid part of these 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:55.030
 anomalies what we should do is every 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.799
 23 years maximum replace the water 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.289
 of the radiator circuit that is 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:04.380
 advisable practically by all 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.380
 plastics vehicle manufacturers
