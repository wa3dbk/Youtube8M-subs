00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
and more honestly more having more

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.190 
and more honestly more having more
control<00:01:57.790> certainly<00:01:58.330> makes<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.659> difference<00:01:59.020> and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
control certainly makes a difference and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.350 
control certainly makes a difference and
is<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.740> one<00:02:00.010> reason<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.520> game<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.940> worth

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
is just one reason this game is worth

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600 
is just one reason this game is worth
while<00:02:01.710> another<00:02:02.710> being<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.250> awesome<00:02:03.580> game

modes<00:02:03.970> included<00:02:04.540> of<00:02:04.690> course<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.560> game<00:02:05.740> is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
modes included of course so the game is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
team this one could be potentially a bit

team this one could be potentially a bit
slower<00:02:28.780> paced<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.160> cool<00:02:30.489> I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
slower paced but it's just really cool I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.130 
slower paced but it's just really cool I
love<00:02:30.940> what<00:02:31.180> they<00:02:31.209> did<00:02:31.330> with<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.110> can

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
love what they did with it you can

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.620 
love what they did with it you can
either<00:02:32.709> eliminate<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.760> each<00:02:33.970> other's<00:02:34.330> teams

either eliminate the each other's teams

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.110 
either eliminate the each other's teams
or<00:02:34.900> completely<00:02:35.800> objective<00:02:36.010> which<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.970> have

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
or completely objective which you have

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.850 
or completely objective which you have
to<00:02:37.300> complete<00:02:37.780> for<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.050> mission<00:02:38.140> modes<00:02:38.440> so

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
to complete for the mission modes so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.640 
to complete for the mission modes so
while<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> game<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.370> fast-paced<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.690> lot<00:02:41.440> of

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
while the game is fast-paced as a lot of

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.650 
while the game is fast-paced as a lot of
strategy<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.220> place<00:02:42.340> which<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.850> implemented

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
strategy in place which is implemented

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.660 
strategy in place which is implemented
without<00:02:43.959> making<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.709> rounds<00:02:44.860> stalling<00:02:45.550> or

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
without making the rounds stalling or

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.390 
without making the rounds stalling or
taking<00:02:46.090> longer<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.650> genuinely

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
taking longer and this is genuinely

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.940 
taking longer and this is genuinely
genius<00:02:49.000> what<00:02:49.120> they<00:02:49.239> do<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:49.780> done<00:02:50.739> by<00:02:50.920> a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
genius what they do here it's done by a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.370 
genius what they do here it's done by a
number<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.489> ways<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:52.360> one<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:53.019> which<00:02:53.200> is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
number of ways but one of which is

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.770 
number of ways but one of which is
letting<00:02:53.920> players<00:02:54.070> select<00:02:54.820> where<00:02:55.209> they<00:02:55.420> spawn

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
letting players select where they spawn

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.110 
letting players select where they spawn
so<00:02:56.140> they<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.440> spawn<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.980> sort<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.670> different

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so they can spawn in sort of different

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.090 
so they can spawn in sort of different
spawn<00:02:58.420> sections<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.560> know<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.769> they<00:02:59.890> can<00:03:00.010> get

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
spawn sections you know so they can get

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.699 
spawn sections you know so they can get
two<00:03:00.220> areas<00:03:00.579> quicker<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.299> this<00:03:02.290> way<00:03:02.440> players

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
two areas quicker and this way players

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.140 
two areas quicker and this way players
could<00:03:02.980> go<00:03:03.070> where<00:03:03.220> they<00:03:03.310> want<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.730> faster

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
could go where they want to you faster

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.789 
could go where they want to you faster
and<00:03:04.329> initiate<00:03:04.720> their<00:03:04.900> strategies<00:03:05.530> quicker

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
and initiate their strategies quicker

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.100 
and initiate their strategies quicker
with<00:03:06.400> less<00:03:06.430> delay<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.360> while<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.870> really

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
with less delay and while it's a really

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.569 
with less delay and while it's a really
small<00:03:08.260> thing<00:03:08.890> okay<00:03:09.130> it's<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.280> really<00:03:09.459> small

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
small thing okay it's a really small

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.890 
small thing okay it's a really small
thing<00:03:09.970> because<00:03:10.150> normally<00:03:10.480> games<00:03:10.660> have<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
thing because normally games have a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.590 
thing because normally games have a
spawn<00:03:11.200> where<00:03:11.470> we<00:03:11.590> want<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.180> having<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.239> spawn

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
spawn where we want but having a spawn

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.410 
spawn where we want but having a spawn
where<00:03:14.290> we<00:03:14.440> want<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:15.070> going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.610> certain<00:03:16.030> areas

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
where we want and going to certain areas

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
where we want and going to certain areas
faster<00:03:16.840> that's<00:03:17.079> that's<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.470> huge<00:03:17.739> thing<00:03:17.799> even

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
faster that's that's a huge thing even

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.590 
faster that's that's a huge thing even
though<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:18.549> not<00:03:18.610> too<00:03:18.970> big<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.390> difference

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
though it's not too big of a difference

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.300 
though it's not too big of a difference
it<00:03:20.019> will<00:03:20.260> make<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.530> difference<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.130> long

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it will make a difference in the long

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.920 
it will make a difference in the long
run<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.820> match<00:03:22.030> especially<00:03:22.269> when<00:03:22.780> these

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
run of a match especially when these

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.840 
run of a match especially when these
matches<00:03:23.350> don't<00:03:23.560> really<00:03:23.829> last<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.190> long<00:03:24.519> um

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
matches don't really last that long um

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.780 
matches don't really last that long um
this<00:03:25.810> way<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.980> makes<00:03:27.130> strategy<00:03:27.610> so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
this way it just it makes strategy so

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.789 
this way it just it makes strategy so
much<00:03:27.940> prettier<00:03:28.329> ain't<00:03:28.810> them<00:03:29.079> all<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.560> can

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
much prettier ain't them all so you can

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.229 
much prettier ain't them all so you can
see<00:03:30.010> where<00:03:30.430> your<00:03:30.549> teammates<00:03:30.700> are<00:03:31.000> going<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
see where your teammates are going to

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.670 
see where your teammates are going to
spawn<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.720> if<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.930> want<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.110> spawn<00:03:32.320> with<00:03:32.560> your

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
