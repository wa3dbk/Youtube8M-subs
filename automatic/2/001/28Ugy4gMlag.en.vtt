00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it take to drive from one end to the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.440 
it take to drive from one end to the
other<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.610> instance<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.890> try<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.820> like

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
other for instance and try like like

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
other for instance and try like like
explicitly<00:00:49.289> driving<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.190> side<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
explicitly driving from one side to the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
explicitly driving from one side to the
other<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.809> game<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.230> sounds<00:00:52.530> crazy<00:00:52.770> or

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
other in the game which sounds crazy or

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.569 
other in the game which sounds crazy or
like<00:00:53.610> bullshit<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.770> reason<00:00:56.039> why<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.250> didn't

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
like bullshit the reason why it didn't

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
like bullshit the reason why it didn't
is<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.030> didn't<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.329> pay<00:00:57.739> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
is because we didn't really pay that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
is because we didn't really pay that
much<00:00:59.210> importance<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> scales<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:02.070> been<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
much importance to scales I've been I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.469 
much importance to scales I've been I
did<00:01:03.710> open<00:01:04.710> long<00:01:04.949> games<00:01:05.189> before<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
did open long games before and and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.630 
did open long games before and and
that's<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.080> own<00:01:07.229> personal<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.310> like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that's my own personal take on it like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's my own personal take on it like
it<00:01:08.880> size<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.380> trap

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it size can be a trap

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
it size can be a trap
like<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.060> mechanics<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.810> content<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like any other mechanics or content in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
like any other mechanics or content in
the<00:01:13.560> game<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> create<00:01:14.659> what<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the game you want to create what you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
the game you want to create what you
mean<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
mean you don't want to do just for the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.020 
mean you don't want to do just for the
sake<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> doing<00:01:18.270> it

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
sake of doing it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.180 
sake of doing it
and<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.480> side<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.080> something<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.770> matters

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and the side of something that matters

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.190 
and the side of something that matters
when<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.550> need<00:01:21.730> it<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.210> if<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.840> take<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.140> game

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
when you need it so if you take it game

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.620 
when you need it so if you take it game
like<00:01:23.380> GTA<00:01:23.680> 5<00:01:23.980> for<00:01:24.280> example<00:01:24.370> it's<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.120> massive

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
like GTA 5 for example it's a massive

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
like GTA 5 for example it's a massive
well<00:01:25.870> but<00:01:26.410> they<00:01:26.530> have<00:01:26.680> jets<00:01:27.900> hey<00:01:28.900> jet<00:01:29.740> speeds

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
well but they have jets hey jet speeds

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.000 
well but they have jets hey jet speeds
so<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.690> think<00:01:31.960> there's<00:01:32.140> there's<00:01:32.500> totally

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
so like I think there's there's totally

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.370 
so like I think there's there's totally
illegitimate<00:01:33.220> way<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.120> doing<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.540> there<00:01:34.840> in

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
illegitimate way of doing it there in

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.410 
illegitimate way of doing it there in
ours<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:35.860> our<00:01:36.100> case<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.760> have<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> lot<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.150> that

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
ours in our case we have a lot of that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.390 
ours in our case we have a lot of that
we<00:01:38.020> want<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.440> want<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.650> play<00:01:38.800> for<00:01:38.950> 20<00:01:39.160> minutes

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
we want we want to play for 20 minutes

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.780 
we want we want to play for 20 minutes
and<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.850> roadblock<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.770> were<00:01:41.950> focusing<00:01:42.670> a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
and the roadblock so we were focusing a

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.790 
and the roadblock so we were focusing a
lot<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.150> them<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.960> making<00:01:44.470> sure<00:01:44.650> we

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
lot on that them and making sure we

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.270 
lot on that them and making sure we
don't<00:01:44.920> add<00:01:46.020> extra<00:01:47.020> space<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.710> would<00:01:47.860> cause<00:01:48.250> a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
don't add extra space that would cause a

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.240 
don't add extra space that would cause a
problem<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.270> desire<00:01:49.720> at<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.590> game<00:01:51.070> is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
problem to that desire at the game is

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.450 
problem to that desire at the game is
massive<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.820> Chicago's<00:01:52.509> massive<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:54.250> don't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
massive and Chicago's massive but don't

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.940 
massive and Chicago's massive but don't
expect<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:55.450> know<00:01:55.570> like<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.930> biggest<00:01:56.380> open

the kind of guys who have the balls to

the kind of guys who have the balls to
try<00:03:11.109> something<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:11.680> CTOs<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.239> we<00:03:13.359> wanted<00:03:13.599> a

it's<00:03:16.390> also<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.840> great<00:03:17.109> way<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.349> bring<00:03:17.769> players

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
it's also a great way to bring players

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.860

to<00:03:18.280> discover<00:03:18.430> maybe<00:03:18.879> a<00:03:19.030> different<00:03:19.450> part<00:03:19.660> of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
to discover maybe a different part of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so proactive with problems but that's

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.610 
so proactive with problems but that's
how<00:03:33.639> they<00:03:33.849> became<00:03:34.209> strong<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:34.810> burn<00:03:35.079> almost

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
how they became strong they burn almost

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.940 
how they became strong they burn almost
to<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.160> ground<00:03:36.400> and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
to the ground and

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.830 
to the ground and
built<00:03:37.280> itself<00:03:37.640> they<00:03:37.849> have<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.150> riots<00:03:38.569> they

built itself they have the riots they
reinvented<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.770> leaves<00:03:40.010> forces<00:03:40.520> as<00:03:40.640> they

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
reinvented the leaves forces as they

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.589 
reinvented the leaves forces as they
near<00:03:42.019> constantly<00:03:43.180> surviving<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.330> becoming

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
stronger with those things and they're

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.979 
stronger with those things and they're

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
think it's a great place to explore for

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.900 
think it's a great place to explore for
a<00:03:50.090> game<00:03:50.269> like<00:03:50.300> watch<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.250> have<00:03:52.760> this

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
a game like watch it so you have this

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.270

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
goes beyond what you can actually

goes beyond what you can actually
activate<00:04:17.299> in<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.570> game<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:18.079> like<00:04:18.139> if<00:04:18.350> they

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
activate in the game it's like if they

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.379 
activate in the game it's like if they
want<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.799> talk<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.100> each<00:04:19.250> other<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.790> create

do<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.350> think<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.650> was<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.729> nice

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
do it and I think it was just a a nice

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.170 
do it and I think it was just a a nice
nod<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.680> part<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.160> what<00:04:28.370> game<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.790> like

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
nod that that part of what game is like

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.480 
nod that that part of what game is like
we<00:04:29.450> tend<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.810> do<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> lot<00:04:30.260> of<00:04:30.500> constraint<00:04:31.010> in

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
we tend to do a lot of constraint in

we tend to do a lot of constraint in
video<00:04:31.790> games<00:04:32.030> these<00:04:32.180> things<00:04:32.450> for<00:04:32.630> good

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
video games these things for good

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.780 
video games these things for good
reasons<00:04:33.139> but<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.979> have<00:04:34.160> a<00:04:34.190> place<00:04:34.490> where<00:04:34.669> they

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
reasons but to have a place where they

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.270 
reasons but to have a place where they
can<00:04:34.940> go<00:04:35.150> in<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.419> pure<00:04:35.630> sandbox<00:04:36.110> it<00:04:36.320> in<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.919> go

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
can go in the pure sandbox it in and go

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.159 
can go in the pure sandbox it in and go
beyond<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.760> rules<00:04:37.940> we<00:04:38.120> give<00:04:38.300> them<00:04:38.510> create

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
beyond the rules we give them create

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.379 
beyond the rules we give them create
their<00:04:39.290> own<00:04:39.350> constraints<00:04:40.220> it's<00:04:40.820> just<00:04:41.150> another

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
their own constraints it's just another

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.920 
their own constraints it's just another
way<00:04:41.600> for<00:04:41.630> them<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:43.250> give<00:04:43.430> back<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.970> us<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.660> to

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
way for them to to give back to us to to

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.050 
way for them to to give back to us to to
to<00:04:45.200> blow<00:04:45.680> us<00:04:45.860> away<00:04:45.889> with<00:04:46.580> what<00:04:46.760> they<00:04:46.789> would

to blow us away with what they would

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.270 
to blow us away with what they would
have<00:04:47.150> done<00:04:47.330> with<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:48.740> think<00:04:48.860> it's<00:04:49.190> a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
have done with it and I think it's a

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.340 
have done with it and I think it's a
great<00:04:49.490> place<00:04:49.729> for<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.479> furry<00:04:50.690> exploring

lot like everybody else in the game of
what<00:05:29.489> it<00:05:29.579> needs<00:05:29.819> to<00:05:29.909> act<00:05:30.179> everything<00:05:30.599> around

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:30.809 
what it needs to act everything around

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:33.709 
what it needs to act everything around
you<00:05:31.049> and<00:05:31.469> now<00:05:32.309> that<00:05:32.339> we<00:05:32.729> have<00:05:32.939> a<00:05:32.969> canvas<00:05:33.539> that

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
you and now that we have a canvas that
