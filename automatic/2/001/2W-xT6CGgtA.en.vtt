forward stop

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.790 
forward stop
well<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> buttons<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.320> same<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
well the buttons are the same on all the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
well the buttons are the same on all the
different<00:00:47.100> machines<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.520> why<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> like

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
different machines that's why so like

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
different machines that's why so like
this<00:00:48.539> has<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> auger<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.949> lathe<00:00:50.219> has

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this has the auger that is the lathe has

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
this has the auger that is the lathe has
a<00:00:50.460> conveyor<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.180> buttons<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> same<00:00:51.870> yes

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a conveyor the buttons are the same yes

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
a conveyor the buttons are the same yes
sometimes<00:00:52.800> they're<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:52.980> different<00:00:53.250> positions

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
sometimes they're in different positions

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.010 
sometimes they're in different positions
yeah<00:00:54.059> whether<00:00:54.300> it'll<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> thorough<00:00:54.809> mill

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
yeah whether it'll a thorough mill

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
yeah whether it'll a thorough mill
they'd<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.230> swapped<00:00:55.500> yeah<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.670> there's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
they'd be swapped yeah but it's there's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
they'd be swapped yeah but it's there's
a<00:00:57.239> big<00:00:57.480> screw<00:00:58.170> auger<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> Archimedean<00:00:59.039> spiral

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a big screw auger and Archimedean spiral

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.630 
a big screw auger and Archimedean spiral
yep<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:01.199> you're<00:01:01.680> you're<00:01:02.190> running<00:01:02.519> your

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
yep and when you're you're running your

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.860 
yep and when you're you're running your
machine<00:01:02.910> you're<00:01:03.059> making<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.390> chip<00:01:03.539> stuff

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
machine you're making your chip stuff

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.340 
machine you're making your chip stuff
falls<00:01:04.080> down<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:05.429> works<00:01:05.929> it's<00:01:06.929> not<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
falls down and this works it's not the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.600 
falls down and this works it's not the
same<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.649> a<00:01:07.679> coolant<00:01:08.009> system<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.399> it<00:01:08.460> works

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
same as a coolant system but it works

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
same as a coolant system but it works
hand-in-hand<00:01:08.910> wit<00:01:09.330> again<00:01:09.630> system<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
hand-in-hand wit again system it's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
hand-in-hand wit again system it's
because<00:01:10.800> like<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.190> back<00:01:11.399> there's<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
because like on the back there's the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.050 
because like on the back there's the
nozzle<00:01:12.840> thing<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.679> flushes

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
nozzle thing in the back that flushes

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.430 
nozzle thing in the back that flushes
the<00:01:15.060> chips<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.840> chips<00:01:16.080> come<00:01:16.259> down

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
the chips out all the chips come down

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380 
the chips out all the chips come down
forward<00:01:16.860> their<00:01:17.310> screens<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.030> coolant<00:01:18.360> gets

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
forward their screens the coolant gets

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
forward their screens the coolant gets
recycled<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> chips<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:20.009> carried

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
recycled back in the chips get carried

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.080 
recycled back in the chips get carried
on<00:01:20.429> out<00:01:20.580> yep

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
on out yep

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
on out yep
so<00:01:21.300> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.899> that<00:01:22.800> there's<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.399> manual

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
so to do this that there's the manual

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
so to do this that there's the manual
way<00:01:23.910> which<00:01:24.149> is<00:01:24.360> chip<00:01:24.660> forward<00:01:25.020> yep<00:01:25.319> and<00:01:25.500> then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
way which is chip forward yep and then

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
way which is chip forward yep and then
they<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.670> yeah<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.240> runs<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.990> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
they come on yeah that runs now if you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.969 
they come on yeah that runs now if you
open<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.530> doors

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
open the doors

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.880 
open the doors
it'll<00:01:29.340> stop<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.789> going<00:01:30.060> it'll<00:01:30.300> stop<00:01:30.569> but<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it'll stop is going it'll stop but it's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
it'll stop is going it'll stop but it's
a<00:01:31.979> safety<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.759> safety<00:01:32.970> thing<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> stops

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a safety it's a safety thing so it stops

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.479 
a safety it's a safety thing so it stops
but<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> hit<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.410> button<00:01:34.619> again<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.099> can

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:35.489 
but if you hit the button again you can

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.130 
but if you hit the button again you can
turn<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.789> on<00:01:35.910> it'll<00:01:36.360> come<00:01:36.599> back<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.929> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
turn it back on it'll come back out and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
turn it back on it'll come back out and
this<00:01:37.440> will<00:01:37.619> allow<00:01:37.709> you<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.099> clean<00:01:38.789> chips<00:01:39.119> if

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this will allow you to clean chips if

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
this will allow you to clean chips if
you<00:01:39.479> were<00:01:39.569> to<00:01:39.660> use<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> broom<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.349> something

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you were to use a broom or something

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.160 
you were to use a broom or something
well<00:01:40.860> there's<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.759> hose<00:01:42.750> always

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
well there's a there's a hose always

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.870 
well there's a there's a hose always
under<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.440> holes<00:01:43.709> in<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.920> nozzle<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
under the holes in the nozzle so and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.639 
under the holes in the nozzle so and
that's<00:01:45.330> how<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.539> do<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.959> we<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.410> out<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that's how we do it we we get out the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.430 
that's how we do it we we get out the
hose<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.099> hose<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.429> down<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.030> goes<00:01:48.209> out

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
hose and hose it down it all goes out

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.529 
hose and hose it down it all goes out
and<00:01:49.440> there's<00:01:49.709> a<00:01:49.800> reverse<00:01:50.160> in<00:01:50.880> case<00:01:51.090> chips<00:01:51.420> get

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
and there's a reverse in case chips get

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.029 
and there's a reverse in case chips get
stuck<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.989> got<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> watch<00:01:52.349> yeah<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.860> what<00:01:52.979> I

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
stuck you got a watch yeah that's what I

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.740 
stuck you got a watch yeah that's what I
figured<00:01:53.069> if<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.940> if<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.300> get<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> rat's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
figured if you get if you get a rat's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
figured if you get if you get a rat's
nest<00:01:54.869> especially<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.679> lathe<00:01:55.830> but<00:01:56.129> if<00:01:56.190> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
nest especially on the lathe but if you

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.339 
nest especially on the lathe but if you
get<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.429> rat's<00:01:56.670> nest<00:01:56.819> or<00:01:57.209> a<00:01:57.239> giant<00:01:57.599> steel<00:01:58.050> wool

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
get a rat's nest or a giant steel wool

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.109 
get a rat's nest or a giant steel wool
ball<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.580> careful<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
ball you got to be careful of what you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
ball you got to be careful of what you
pack<00:02:00.420> through<00:02:00.720> there<00:02:00.899> okay<00:02:01.080> all<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.739> yeah

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
pack through there okay all right yeah

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.979 
pack through there okay all right yeah
and<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.849> should<00:02:02.879> run<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> chip<00:02:03.599> auger

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
and you should run the chip auger

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.930 
and you should run the chip auger
because<00:02:04.379> it<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:04.649> run<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> program<00:02:05.429> m31

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
because it will run it a program m31

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
because it will run it a program m31
turns<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.539> on<00:02:07.129> 3233<00:02:08.129> shuts<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.520> off<00:02:08.670> okay<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.229> 31

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
turns it on 3233 shuts it off okay so 31

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
turns it on 3233 shuts it off okay so 31
turns<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> 933<00:02:11.550> shuts<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> off<00:02:12.000> okay<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.900> can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
turns a 933 shuts it off okay so you can

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.540 
turns a 933 shuts it off okay so you can
put<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.560> program<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> run

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
put that in the program to have it run

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.920 
put that in the program to have it run
every<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.270> then<00:02:15.330> while<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.599> running

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
every now and then while it's running

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.170 
every now and then while it's running
parts<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.220> any<00:02:17.340> reason<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.879> have<00:02:18.090> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
parts is there any reason to not have it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.309 
parts is there any reason to not have it
run<00:02:18.300> continuously<00:02:19.520> noisy<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.180> no<00:02:21.780> that's<00:02:22.109> it

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
run continuously noisy okay no that's it

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.229 
run continuously noisy okay no that's it
yeah<00:02:22.560> there's<00:02:23.280> no<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.819> don't<00:02:23.939> see<00:02:24.090> why<00:02:24.180> you

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
yeah there's no you don't see why you

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.310 
yeah there's no you don't see why you
couldn't

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
couldn't

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.440 
couldn't
right<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.340> turn<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.240> through

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
right but you turn it on and off through

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.970 
right but you turn it on and off through
the<00:02:27.570> program<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> help<00:02:28.230> keep<00:02:28.470> things<00:02:28.740> clean

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the program to help keep things clean

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.530 
the program to help keep things clean
because<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.760> run<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.120> day<00:02:30.270> without

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
because if you run it all day without

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.030 
because if you run it all day without
turning<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:30.930> now<00:02:31.320> you've<00:02:31.470> got<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> mess<00:02:31.860> you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
turning it on now you've got a mess you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.860 
turning it on now you've got a mess you
got<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> push<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.580> these<00:02:32.790> chips<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
got to push all these chips out of the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.090 
got to push all these chips out of the
machine<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:34.530> better<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
machine so it's better to have a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
machine so it's better to have a
constant<00:02:35.640> light<00:02:36.030> stream<00:02:36.720> exactly<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:38.120> where

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
constant light stream exactly now where

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.150 
constant light stream exactly now where
do<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.330> chips<00:02:39.570> go<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.410> chips<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.800> down<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
do the chips go the chips go down the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.860 
do the chips go the chips go down the
end<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.520> they<00:02:41.580> go<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.970> chute<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.420> then

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
end and they go out of chute and then

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.060 
end and they go out of chute and then
you<00:02:42.960> have<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> have<00:02:43.290> something<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.650> catch<00:02:43.860> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
you have to have something to catch the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.830 
you have to have something to catch the
chips<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.850> dump<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.150> right<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> floor

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
chips or just dump it right on the floor

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.500 
chips or just dump it right on the floor
now<00:02:46.680> most<00:02:47.010> shops<00:02:47.280> tend<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> variety<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
now most shops tend to have a variety of

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
now most shops tend to have a variety of
containers<00:02:48.960> for<00:02:49.290> chips<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.590> don't<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.130> one

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
containers for chips I don't have one

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.910 
containers for chips I don't have one
for<00:02:50.430> aluminum<00:02:50.850> one<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.600> steel<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.710> brass

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
for aluminum one for steel one for brass

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.070 
for aluminum one for steel one for brass
yes<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.360> chips<00:02:54.900> get

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
yes you can do that because chips get

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680 
yes you can do that because chips get
recycled<00:02:55.320> yes<00:02:55.800> money<00:02:56.010> their<00:02:56.280> money<00:02:56.790> out<00:02:57.360> of

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
recycled yes money their money out of

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.720 
recycled yes money their money out of
machine<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.410> somebody<00:02:59.010> wants<00:02:59.280> most<00:02:59.520> of

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
machine but somebody wants most of

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.790 
machine but somebody wants most of
today's<00:03:00.060> steel<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.600> recycled<00:03:00.870> material

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
today's steel is recycled material

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.310 
today's steel is recycled material
really<00:03:02.400> yeah<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.780> ridiculous

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
really yeah it's like a ridiculous

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560 
really yeah it's like a ridiculous
number<00:03:04.410> for<00:03:04.680> cars<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.370> 92<00:03:06.210> percent<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
number for cars it's like 92 percent of

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.500 
number for cars it's like 92 percent of
a<00:03:06.630> cars<00:03:06.810> recycled<00:03:07.440> okay<00:03:07.830> yeah<00:03:08.100> cool<00:03:08.730> okay<00:03:09.000> so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
a cars recycled okay yeah cool okay so

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.020 
a cars recycled okay yeah cool okay so
we<00:03:10.410> covered<00:03:10.650> software<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.280> covered<00:03:11.580> manual

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
we covered software we covered manual

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.520 
we covered software we covered manual
what<00:03:12.510> else<00:03:12.660> do<00:03:12.810> we<00:03:12.840> get<00:03:12.990> well<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:13.500> a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
what else do we get well you have a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.380 
what else do we get well you have a
reverse<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.250> case<00:03:14.460> you<00:03:14.580> get<00:03:14.670> chips<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.090> stuck

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
reverse in case you get chips get stuck

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.510 
reverse in case you get chips get stuck
okay<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.140> gets<00:03:16.290> jammed<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.980> won't<00:03:17.040> go<00:03:17.310> any

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
okay it gets jammed up it won't go any

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.610 
okay it gets jammed up it won't go any
farther<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.880> will<00:03:17.970> actually<00:03:18.300> lock<00:03:18.510> up<00:03:18.780> will<00:03:19.500> it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
farther it will actually lock up will it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
farther it will actually lock up will it
turn<00:03:19.770> itself<00:03:20.010> off<00:03:20.220> yes<00:03:20.670> let's<00:03:20.970> stop<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:21.330> it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
turn itself off yes let's stop so it's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.420 
turn itself off yes let's stop so it's
stuck<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.830> reverse<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.340> you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
stuck so now you have to reverse it you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.680 
stuck so now you have to reverse it you
could<00:03:23.580> back<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> out<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.240> get<00:03:24.600> in

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
could back it out you have to get in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.510 
could back it out you have to get in
there<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.050> clean<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.560> whatever<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.280> making

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
it's stuck and you can go back and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
it's stuck and you can go back and
finish<00:03:28.290> cleaning<00:03:28.560> them<00:03:28.770> up<00:03:28.830> sounds<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.340> a

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
finish cleaning them up sounds like a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.890 
finish cleaning them up sounds like a
job<00:03:29.550> for<00:03:29.610> an<00:03:29.820> intern<00:03:31.790> okay<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.270> that's<00:03:33.420> that's

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
job for an intern okay but that's that's
the<00:03:34.080> basics<00:03:34.440> now<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.800> works<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.310> coolant

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the basics now this works with coolant

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.640 
the basics now this works with coolant
so<00:03:35.940> usually<00:03:36.420> let's<00:03:36.660> close<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> doors<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.470> this
