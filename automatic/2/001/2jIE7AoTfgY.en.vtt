i<00:04:03.000> can't<00:04:03.510> really<00:04:03.660> wait<00:04:03.900> for<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.200> pouch<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.560> be

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
i can't really wait for the pouch to be

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.070 
i can't really wait for the pouch to be
revealed<00:04:04.950> exactly<00:04:05.610> what<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:06.000> gonna<00:04:06.570> be

game I think dollar a lot of the black
lab<00:04:15.030> players<00:04:15.330> really<00:04:15.780> deserve<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.530> they

reach another new level in terms of

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.110 
reach another new level in terms of

you<00:05:42.540> can<00:05:42.690> get<00:05:42.990> away<00:05:43.110> with<00:05:43.320> exposed<00:05:43.830> being

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
you can get away with exposed being

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.390 
you can get away with exposed being
exposed<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.790> having<00:05:45.390> no<00:05:45.510> cover<00:05:45.810> or<00:05:46.260> you<00:05:47.190> can

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
exposed and having no cover or you can

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.220 
exposed and having no cover or you can
get<00:05:47.490> away<00:05:47.580> with<00:05:47.790> pretty<00:05:48.300> crappy<00:05:48.600> gun<00:05:48.930> skills

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
get away with pretty crappy gun skills

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.740 
get away with pretty crappy gun skills
and<00:05:49.560> whatnot<00:05:49.920> when<00:05:50.190> you're<00:05:50.340> playing<00:05:50.670> in<00:05:51.090> a

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
and whatnot when you're playing in a

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.720 
and whatnot when you're playing in a
public<00:05:52.140> match<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:52.680> keep<00:05:52.860> Tom<00:05:53.100> my<00:05:53.250> clanmates

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
public match and I keep Tom my clanmates

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.450 
public match and I keep Tom my clanmates
that<00:05:53.970> that<00:05:54.270> hey<00:05:54.680> public<00:05:55.680> matches<00:05:55.860> are<00:05:56.220> great

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
that that hey public matches are great

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.790 
that that hey public matches are great
once<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.390> while<00:05:57.570> but<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.200> really<00:05:58.470> want<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
once in a while but you really want to

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.980 
once in a while but you really want to
play<00:05:58.950> with<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.880> best<00:06:00.060> people<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.570> find

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
play with the best people you can find

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.780 
play with the best people you can find
especially<00:06:01.680> for<00:06:02.250> something<00:06:02.520> like<00:06:02.730> a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
especially for something like a

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.360 
especially for something like a
tournament<00:06:03.360> because<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:04.440> raises<00:06:04.890> your<00:06:05.070> bar

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
tournament because that raises your bar

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.550 
tournament because that raises your bar
that<00:06:05.640> raises<00:06:05.940> your<00:06:06.090> level<00:06:06.540> of<00:06:06.630> gameplay<00:06:07.080> and

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
that raises your level of gameplay and

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.890 
that raises your level of gameplay and
um<00:06:07.890> because<00:06:08.430> when<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:09.060> play<00:06:09.090> against<00:06:09.720> them

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
um because when you play against them

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.470 
um because when you play against them
pub<00:06:10.740> matches<00:06:11.190> and<00:06:11.400> public<00:06:11.700> players<00:06:11.970> I<00:06:12.300> mean

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
pub matches and public players I mean

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.880 
pub matches and public players I mean
let's<00:06:12.600> be<00:06:12.870> honest<00:06:13.380> you're<00:06:13.530> pretty<00:06:13.800> much

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
let's be honest you're pretty much

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.010 
let's be honest you're pretty much
you're<00:06:14.730> lowering<00:06:15.090> your<00:06:15.270> level<00:06:15.630> of<00:06:15.690> play

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
you're lowering your level of play

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.840 
you're lowering your level of play
because<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.770> don't<00:06:16.950> have<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.130> play<00:06:17.460> as<00:06:17.640> hard

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
because you don't have to play as hard

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.480 
because you don't have to play as hard
or<00:06:18.120> you'd<00:06:18.270> have<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.540> play<00:06:18.810> as<00:06:19.160> careful<00:06:20.160> as<00:06:20.280> you

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
or you'd have to play as careful as you

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.850 
or you'd have to play as careful as you
would<00:06:20.700> in<00:06:20.940> a<00:06:21.030> clan<00:06:21.270> match<00:06:21.650> so<00:06:22.650> that's

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
would in a clan match so that's

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.530 
would in a clan match so that's
something<00:06:23.100> we<00:06:23.280> really<00:06:23.400> emphasizing<00:06:24.150> when

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
something we really emphasizing when

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.390 
something we really emphasizing when
we're<00:06:24.690> doing<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:24.900> lot<00:06:24.990> of<00:06:25.050> closed<00:06:25.440> practice

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
we're doing a lot of closed practice

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.600 
we're doing a lot of closed practice
matches<00:06:26.610> with<00:06:26.970> each<00:06:27.180> other<00:06:27.530> a<00:06:28.530> lot<00:06:28.980> of<00:06:29.100> 2<00:06:29.250> v2<00:06:29.400> is

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
matches with each other a lot of 2 v2 is

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.030 
matches with each other a lot of 2 v2 is
one<00:06:29.850> be<00:06:30.030> ones<00:06:30.240> that<00:06:30.570> matches<00:06:31.140> like<00:06:31.260> I<00:06:31.410> said<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
one be ones that matches like I said and

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.100 
one be ones that matches like I said and
I'll<00:06:32.220> we're<00:06:32.940> just<00:06:33.150> getting<00:06:33.330> prepared<00:06:33.450> I<00:06:33.900> think

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
I'll we're just getting prepared I think

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.920 
I'll we're just getting prepared I think
ultimately<00:06:34.669> if<00:06:35.669> we're<00:06:36.000> if<00:06:36.210> we're<00:06:36.360> if<00:06:36.810> we're

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
ultimately if we're if we're if we're

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.690 
ultimately if we're if we're if we're
going<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.140> be<00:06:37.260> prepared<00:06:37.650> and<00:06:37.890> we<00:06:38.070> have<00:06:38.310> at

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
going to be prepared and we have at

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.490 
going to be prepared and we have at
least<00:06:38.760> a<00:06:39.150> mindset<00:06:39.930> will

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
least a mindset will

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.310 
least a mindset will
not<00:06:40.800> really<00:06:41.460> under<00:06:42.420> estimating<00:06:43.020> any<00:06:43.140> other

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
not really under estimating any other

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.700 
not really under estimating any other
clan<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:43.980> think<00:06:44.340> we'll<00:06:44.520> be<00:06:44.880> okay<00:06:45.360> but<00:06:46.320> i<00:06:46.350> think

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
clan I think we'll be okay but i think

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.010 
clan I think we'll be okay but i think
if<00:06:46.920> we<00:06:46.950> get<00:06:47.130> too<00:06:47.280> complacent<00:06:47.550> though<00:06:48.030> that'll

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
if we get too complacent though that'll

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.750 
if we get too complacent though that'll
just<00:06:49.170> throw<00:06:49.350> everything<00:06:49.470> out<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:49.950> window<00:06:50.280> but

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
just throw everything out the window but

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.670 
just throw everything out the window but
