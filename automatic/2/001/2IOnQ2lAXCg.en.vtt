00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.890
 Yes it's a snafkin theme Moomin's insertion song 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:15.620
 Now with even we will easily by the heavy snow but is this song and first now songs pig only 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.770
 Race that is the main melody by using 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.000
 I'm fond of it but Code Strong 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.780
 It will be both a typical ship tree style of 5- 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.930
 Honest for beginners who have just learned the code 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:36.530
 It may be difficult but to some extent 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 I feel from there Kedomo code can be subtracted previous peeling Toka Meeting stroke is the kana imaichi 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 Shake picking for those who are 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:49.949
 I think it is a task song that will be studied very much to cultivate a sense of rhythm Let's go now 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.210

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 It is dropped 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.620
 Nara Let's say drop the cram school thunder have dropped about 70 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.450
 I hope while slowly accurately grasp the position 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:31.860

 As per each school, you can add melody to simple chords 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.170
 Known method It is an engineering black method often used with wire 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:54.090
 It is the basis of the right hand to play this song 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:57.690
 Let's tell of the base 1 universe has become seemed out with removal here 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.910
 Six years in this one minor

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.500
 q 2 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.050
 In the current state 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:33.120
 Well it is one bullet this 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.120

 The last story is the pick is felt that the pottery is back or 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:10.240
 Although the forest leaving the six years I think to 6 end 94 good Nemonemo 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.770
 I 'm not worried about this Anyway, let's just as well call it 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.460
 6 strings etc 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.460
 me 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:26.070
 The following is one of Te basis for that expression to this lecture 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.640
 I mean the hammer ring was added to say hammering standing sound nerd like a comma 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.729
 It is the meaning 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:34.999
 Specifically this day is minor and 2 frets of 5 strings 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.600
 I first bulletin magazine etymology in light of 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.910
 Hmmm 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.230
 Who is the straight leaf manual 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.720
 Get as N rain 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.740
 It is this first 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.330
 me 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.909
 I do not have such a story 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.909
 5-string 6-string, which will continue to put in a base running of cry this 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.110
 I feel like this 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.110
 Let's continue 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.110
 34 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:22.849
 From one another half century will pull a face and pet stroke at the same time 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.790
 Eee eh How to hair one may be considered at the time of the volume in this 6 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.960
 Another pro ii 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:32.650
 How about the same sound as the 321 ? 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:38.260
 Also the role of 321 is loud and the sound is also high 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:42.630
 So if anything, cut the notes on the bass well. 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.630
 2 to plan after the can 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.810

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:00.680
 If you change your mind or overwhelm you 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.680
 Lightly 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.690
