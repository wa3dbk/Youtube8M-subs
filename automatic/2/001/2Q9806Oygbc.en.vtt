hello my friends this is Eric merit at

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.249 
hello my friends this is Eric merit at
des<00:00:05.370> 3d<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.479> this<00:00:06.569> video<00:00:06.839> we're<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.169> to

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
des 3d and in this video we're going to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.390 
des 3d and in this video we're going to
talk<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.980> parameters<00:00:08.549> tab<00:00:08.870> now<00:00:10.400> there

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
talk about the parameters tab now there

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940 
talk about the parameters tab now there
are<00:00:11.519> many<00:00:11.610> tabs<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.299> show<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.200> properties

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
are many tabs that show you properties

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.089 
are many tabs that show you properties
that<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.250> can<00:00:14.429> edit<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.320> instance<00:00:16.770> we've

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:17.099 
that you can edit so for instance we've

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.790 
that you can edit so for instance we've
got<00:00:17.130> Genesis<00:00:17.970> selected<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.689> and<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.590> want

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
got Genesis selected here and if I want

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
got Genesis selected here and if I want
to<00:00:19.830> move<00:00:20.010> her<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.970> why<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.420> can

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to move her up and down and why I can

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.439 
to move her up and down and why I can
just<00:00:21.869> grab<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.350> slider<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.920> move<00:00:23.359> it<00:00:24.359> around

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
just grab this slider and move it around

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.060 
just grab this slider and move it around
so<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.289> its<00:00:25.590> ex<00:00:25.890> translate<00:00:26.789> property

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
so that is its ex translate property

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.540 
so that is its ex translate property
let's<00:00:29.070> undo<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.539> there's<00:00:30.720> all

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
let's undo that and so there's all

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
let's undo that and so there's all
varieties<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.629> properties<00:00:33.629> if<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.960> slide<00:00:34.710> down

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
varieties of properties if we slide down

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.090 
varieties of properties if we slide down
here<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.210> say<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.839> have<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.769> basic

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
here we can say that we have this basic

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.660 
here we can say that we have this basic
female<00:00:38.820> morph<00:00:39.180> slider<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.989> property<00:00:40.670> dialed

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
female morph slider or property dialed

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
female morph slider or property dialed
up<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.449> make<00:00:42.600> her<00:00:42.720> look<00:00:42.839> more<00:00:42.900> female<00:00:43.760> we've

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
up to make her look more female we've

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.210 
up to make her look more female we've
got<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.870> different<00:00:46.500> types<00:00:46.680> we've<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:47.040> these

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
got all different types we've got these

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.729 
got all different types we've got these
toggle<00:00:47.549> controls<00:00:48.299> color<00:00:49.260> controls<00:00:50.089> and<00:00:51.739> this

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
toggle controls color controls and this

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.880 
toggle controls color controls and this
list<00:00:53.070> shows<00:00:53.460> them<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.909> except<00:00:54.600> anything<00:00:55.589> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
list shows them all except anything that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
list shows them all except anything that
deals<00:00:56.040> with<00:00:56.369> the<00:00:56.580> surface<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.239> let<00:00:57.330> me<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.540> in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
deals with the surface and let me go in

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.969 
deals with the surface and let me go in
here<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> surface<00:00:59.070> tab<00:00:59.339> and<00:01:00.920> show<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
here to the surface tab and show you

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.640 
here to the surface tab and show you
this<00:01:02.250> list<00:01:02.519> this<00:01:03.119> list<00:01:03.479> does<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.140> ever<00:01:04.379> show

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this list this list does not ever show

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
this list this list does not ever show
up<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> parameters<00:01:05.489> tab<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.939> anywhere

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
up in the parameters tab or anywhere

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260 
up in the parameters tab or anywhere
else<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.690> only<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> show<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.160> in<00:01:08.340> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
else it's only going to show up in this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.930 
else it's only going to show up in this
surface<00:01:09.750> tab<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.220> deals<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
surface tab so it deals with all the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.110 
surface tab so it deals with all the
color<00:01:12.210> items<00:01:12.660> right<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.260> diffuse<00:01:13.710> color

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
color items right so diffuse color

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.700 
color items right so diffuse color
specular<00:01:15.120> color<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.660> then<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.470> they're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
specular color and then how much they're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.460 
specular color and then how much they're
dialed<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.850> glossiness<00:01:18.390> anything<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
dialed on the glossiness anything that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.040 
dialed on the glossiness anything that
deals<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> surface<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.850> an<00:01:20.970> object<00:01:21.090> all

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
deals with the surface of an object all

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.360 
deals with the surface of an object all
the<00:01:22.200> stuff<00:01:22.410> over<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.650> parameters<00:01:22.980> tab<00:01:23.160> is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
the stuff over in parameters tab is

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.710 
the stuff over in parameters tab is
really<00:01:23.610> deals<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.940> things<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> live<00:01:24.690> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
really deals with things that live on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.130 
really deals with things that live on
the<00:01:25.050> skeleton<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.770> bones<00:01:26.660> so<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.840> changed

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the skeleton or bones so it changed

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.260 
the skeleton or bones so it changed
their<00:01:28.290> shape<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.130> show<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.700> but

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
their shape things that show up here but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.180 
their shape things that show up here but
surfaces<00:01:30.990> are<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.409> off<00:01:31.590> by<00:01:31.800> itself

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
surfaces are kind of off by itself

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.810 
surfaces are kind of off by itself
alright<00:01:32.970> let's<00:01:33.210> let's<00:01:33.570> show<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.870> something

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
alright let's let's show you something

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
alright let's let's show you something
the<00:01:35.820> comparison<00:01:36.360> between<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.659> shaping<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the comparison between the shaping and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.460 
the comparison between the shaping and
the<00:01:37.920> parameters<00:01:38.430> tabs<00:01:38.750> all<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.230> we've

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the parameters tabs all right so we've

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.680 
the parameters tabs all right so we've
got<00:01:40.500> Genesis<00:01:41.159> selected<00:01:41.580> here<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.570> you'll

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
got Genesis selected here and you'll

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.030 
got Genesis selected here and you'll
notice<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> top<00:01:43.110> over<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.590> an<00:01:43.680> actor

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
notice at the top over here is an actor

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.910 
notice at the top over here is an actor
now<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.690> hierarchy<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> property

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
now this is just a hierarchy of property

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.440 
now this is just a hierarchy of property
groups<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.280> these<00:01:47.400> are<00:01:47.550> called<00:01:47.729> regions<00:01:48.180> but

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
groups now these are called regions but

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.350 
groups now these are called regions but
it's<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.560> type<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.950> property<00:01:50.580> group<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.970> we

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's just a type of property group if we

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
it's just a type of property group if we
open<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:51.720> actor<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.490> are

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
open up actor over here right these are

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.430 
open up actor over here right these are
all<00:01:53.640> property<00:01:54.180> groups<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.720> left<00:01:55.050> column

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
all property groups in this left column

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.990 
all property groups in this left column
you'll<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> you've<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.820> some

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you'll see that you've got some

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
you'll see that you've got some
hierarchy<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.900> lower<00:01:58.140> body<00:01:58.440> you've<00:01:58.710> got

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
hierarchy here lower body you've got

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.090 
hierarchy here lower body you've got
feed<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.340> hip<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> legs<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.680> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.830> over

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
feed to hip and legs and if you over

talk about the filtering all right

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.930 
talk about the filtering all right
before<00:03:05.110> we<00:03:05.230> actually<00:03:05.430> filter<00:03:06.430> something<00:03:06.700> with

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
before we actually filter something with

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.430 
before we actually filter something with
a<00:03:06.970> keyword<00:03:07.239> let's<00:03:07.599> talk<00:03:07.840> about<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.230> little

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
a keyword let's talk about this little

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.520 
a keyword let's talk about this little
scene<00:03:08.860> drop-down<00:03:09.370> right<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> side

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
scene drop-down right here on the side

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.009 
scene drop-down right here on the side
if<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.430> select<00:03:12.610> sub<00:03:13.030> dragon<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.480> course<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.900> gets

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
if I select sub dragon of course it gets

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.460 
if I select sub dragon of course it gets
selected<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> scene<00:03:15.450> we<00:03:16.450> can<00:03:16.480> dig<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:17.110> in

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
selected in the scene we can dig down in

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.729 
selected in the scene we can dig down in
something<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:19.209> go<00:03:19.810> all<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.140> way<00:03:20.170> down<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
something and go all the way down in the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.949 
something and go all the way down in the
skeleton<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.730> if<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:21.880> want<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.120> select<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
skeleton and like if I want to select a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.800 
skeleton and like if I want to select a
head<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> can<00:03:23.500> do<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.769> right<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:25.570> works

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
head I can do that right so this works

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.330 
head I can do that right so this works
really<00:03:25.870> well<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.410> navigate<00:03:27.040> through<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
really well to navigate through the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.270 
really well to navigate through the
scene<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.790> select<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.350> specific<00:03:29.350> node<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:29.890> item

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
scene and select a specific node or item

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.059 
scene and select a specific node or item
so<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:31.150> adjust<00:03:31.660> its<00:03:31.870> properties<00:03:32.410> now

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
so you can adjust its properties now

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.080 
so you can adjust its properties now
let's<00:03:33.340> add<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.470> keyword<00:03:35.470> filter<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.130> we'll<00:03:37.000> do

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
let's add a keyword filter and we'll do

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.900 
let's add a keyword filter and we'll do
this<00:03:37.239> filter<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:37.989> all<00:03:38.260> every<00:03:39.130> single<00:03:39.459> property

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
this filter on all every single property

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.599 
this filter on all every single property
for<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.150> head<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.769> let's<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:41.890> type<00:03:42.100> inside

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
for the head and let's just type inside

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.940 
for the head and let's just type inside
and<00:03:43.060> we<00:03:44.049> get<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> nice<00:03:44.470> list<00:03:44.859> of<00:03:46.500> every<00:03:47.500> property

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
and we get a nice list of every property

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.930 
and we get a nice list of every property
that's<00:03:48.160> got<00:03:48.400> side<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:49.209> its<00:03:49.389> name<00:03:49.680> okay

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's got side in its name okay

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.840 
that's got side in its name okay
now<00:03:51.940> let's<00:03:52.180> open<00:03:52.299> this<00:03:52.540> up<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.930> talk<00:03:53.139> about

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
now let's open this up and talk about

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.620 
now let's open this up and talk about
this<00:03:54.850> tri-state<00:03:56.430> text<00:03:57.430> here<00:03:57.670> all<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:58.299> these

this tri-state text here all of these

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.900 
this tri-state text here all of these
property<00:03:59.260> groups<00:03:59.470> look<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.370> little<00:04:00.489> different

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
property groups look a little different

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.340 
property groups look a little different
right<00:04:01.000> we've<00:04:01.209> got<00:04:01.389> some<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.750> are<00:04:01.870> gray

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
we've got some that are white and some

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.110 
we've got some that are white and some
that<00:04:03.760> are<00:04:03.880> very<00:04:04.030> light<00:04:04.329> gray<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:06.280> let's<00:04:07.000> talk

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that are very light gray and let's talk

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.020 
that are very light gray and let's talk
about<00:04:07.299> each<00:04:07.540> one<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:07.900> those<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.769> this<00:04:09.370> one<00:04:09.670> if<00:04:09.910> I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
about each one of those so this one if I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.789 
about each one of those so this one if I
select<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:10.510> you'd<00:04:10.750> probably<00:04:10.780> guess<00:04:11.440> that

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
select it you'd probably guess that

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.099 
select it you'd probably guess that
there's<00:04:11.950> not<00:04:12.069> going<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> be<00:04:12.400> any<00:04:13.109> properties

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
there's not going to be any properties

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.819 
there's not going to be any properties
in<00:04:14.350> this<00:04:14.500> group<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.190> when<00:04:15.340> we<00:04:15.489> do<00:04:15.609> our<00:04:15.760> search

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
in this group so when we do our search

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.500 
in this group so when we do our search
it<00:04:17.829> lets<00:04:18.039> us<00:04:18.190> know<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.400> there<00:04:19.180> are<00:04:19.359> no

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
it lets us know that there are no

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.509 
it lets us know that there are no
properties<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.260> came<00:04:20.859> up<00:04:21.010> in<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.190> search

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
properties that came up in that search

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.000 
properties that came up in that search
that<00:04:21.549> live<00:04:22.030> here<00:04:22.530> that's<00:04:23.530> right<00:04:23.740> there's

or subgroups now we can see that further
if<00:04:43.040> we<00:04:43.610> turn<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.060> off<00:04:44.300> well<00:04:44.600> let's<00:04:44.750> click<00:04:45.350> on

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
if we turn this off well let's click on

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.130 
if we turn this off well let's click on
that<00:04:45.500> one<00:04:45.800> if<00:04:45.980> we<00:04:46.520> turn<00:04:47.030> this<00:04:47.210> show<00:04:47.570> sub-items

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
off this side side side is gonna go away

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.670 
off this side side side is gonna go away
because<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.420> doesn't<00:04:53.690> actually<00:04:53.810> live<00:04:54.200> here<00:04:54.500> it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680

display group and if you click on that
you'll<00:05:45.800> see<00:05:46.040> that<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.340> controls<00:05:46.940> things<00:05:47.150> like

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
you'll see that it controls things like

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.410 
you'll see that it controls things like
whether<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:48.200> object<00:05:48.520> cast<00:05:49.520> shadows<00:05:50.030> or<00:05:50.300> is

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
whether this object cast shadows or is

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.340 
whether this object cast shadows or is
visible<00:05:50.750> in<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> render<00:05:51.370> and<00:05:53.110> things<00:05:54.110> like

visible in the render and things like

whether it's selectable or visible at

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.330 
whether it's selectable or visible at
all<00:05:56.600> in<00:05:56.840> scene<00:05:57.200> so<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.800> turn<00:05:57.980> that<00:05:58.130> off<00:05:58.310> you

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
all in scene so I turn that off you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.470 
all in scene so I turn that off you
can't<00:05:58.700> really<00:05:58.820> see<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.060> but<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.360> head

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
can't really see it but the head

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.170 
can't really see it but the head
disappears<00:06:00.140> so<00:06:00.950> anyway<00:06:01.580> that's<00:06:01.850> not

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
disappears so anyway that's not

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.640 
disappears so anyway that's not
available<00:06:02.600> anywhere<00:06:02.780> else<00:06:02.900> so<00:06:03.230> you<00:06:03.290> do<00:06:03.530> need

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
available anywhere else so you do need

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.470 
available anywhere else so you do need
to<00:06:03.740> come<00:06:03.920> parameters<00:06:04.370> tab<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:05.150> mess<00:06:05.330> with

to come parameters tab to mess with
these<00:06:05.720> type<00:06:06.230> of<00:06:06.260> properties<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:06.860> they're<00:06:06.950> a

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
these type of properties and they're a

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.290 
these type of properties and they're a
little<00:06:07.100> more<00:06:07.280> advanced<00:06:07.550> just<00:06:07.910> whether<00:06:08.090> or<00:06:08.180> not

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
little more advanced just whether or not

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.760 
little more advanced just whether or not
anywhere<00:06:08.600> else<00:06:08.660> but<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.320> can<00:06:09.440> find<00:06:09.620> those

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
anywhere else but you can find those

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.500 
anywhere else but you can find those
right<00:06:09.950> here<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.340> think<00:06:11.180> that's<00:06:11.270> about

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
right here I think that's about

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.270 
right here I think that's about
everything<00:06:11.630> now<00:06:12.560> let's<00:06:12.800> just<00:06:12.950> do<00:06:13.070> a<00:06:13.100> little

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
everything now let's just do a little

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.430 
everything now let's just do a little
summary<00:06:13.670> we<00:06:14.240> understand<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.780> relationship

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
summary we understand the relationship

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.110 
summary we understand the relationship
now<00:06:15.650> between<00:06:15.980> the<00:06:16.190> parameters<00:06:16.610> tab<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.030> other

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
now between the parameters tab and other

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.530 
now between the parameters tab and other
tabs<00:06:17.420> like<00:06:17.630> shaping<00:06:17.960> and<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:18.520> posing<00:06:19.520> and<00:06:20.480> the

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
tabs like shaping and and posing and the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.740 
tabs like shaping and and posing and the
fact<00:06:20.870> that<00:06:21.080> none<00:06:21.530> of<00:06:21.560> the<00:06:21.740> parameters<00:06:22.250> here

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
fact that none of the parameters here

deal with surfaces you've got to go

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.240 
deal with surfaces you've got to go
under<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.460> surface<00:06:25.640> tab<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.800> change<00:06:27.800> any<00:06:28.130> of

under the surface tab to change any of

under the surface tab to change any of

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
the properties of the surface we have

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.980 
the properties of the surface we have
good<00:06:31.310> filtering<00:06:31.760> just<00:06:31.970> like<00:06:32.090> another<00:06:32.270> tabs<00:06:32.660> we

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
good filtering just like another tabs we

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.230 
good filtering just like another tabs we
have<00:06:33.140> this<00:06:33.290> scene<00:06:33.560> drop-down<00:06:34.010> to<00:06:34.640> select<00:06:34.820> an

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
have this scene drop-down to select an

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.890 
have this scene drop-down to select an
item<00:06:35.690> or<00:06:36.080> node

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
item or node

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.950 
item or node
and<00:06:38.900> we<00:06:39.830> have<00:06:40.069> the<00:06:40.910> three<00:06:41.419> different<00:06:41.449> states

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
and we have the three different states

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.559 
and we have the three different states
of<00:06:42.169> text<00:06:42.680> that<00:06:43.370> help<00:06:43.639> you<00:06:43.789> determine<00:06:44.120> where<00:06:44.539> a

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
of text that help you determine where a

of text that help you determine where a
certain<00:06:45.080> property<00:06:45.500> will<00:06:45.710> reside<00:06:46.099> and<00:06:46.340> that's

certain property will reside and that's

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.219 
certain property will reside and that's
it<00:06:47.150> and<00:06:47.360> we'll<00:06:47.479> talk<00:06:47.659> to<00:06:47.690> you<00:06:47.810> next<00:06:47.900> time

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229 
it and we'll talk to you next time
