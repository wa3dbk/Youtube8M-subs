00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
in the make in this system really

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.290 
in the make in this system really
influences<00:02:40.630> how<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.890> scenario<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.820> D<00:02:43.000> you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
influences how the scenario you D you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.390

personally<00:04:09.760> most<00:04:09.879> excited<00:04:10.330> about<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.480> think<00:04:10.599> is

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
personally most excited about I think is

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.309 
personally most excited about I think is
that<00:04:10.959> mix<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.739> vehicle<00:04:12.250> combat<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.930> ground

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
that mix of vehicle combat and on ground

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.140 
that mix of vehicle combat and on ground
combat<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.860> well<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.400> how<00:04:15.610> seamless<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
combat as well and how seamless the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.940 
combat as well and how seamless the
transitions<00:04:16.720> between<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.109> two<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.440> up<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.829> me

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
transitions between the two is up to me

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.890 
transitions between the two is up to me
that<00:04:17.980> is<00:04:18.280> very<00:04:18.310> unique<00:04:18.790> for<00:04:19.180> example<00:04:19.780> you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
that is very unique for example you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.890 
that is very unique for example you
engage<00:04:20.229> other<00:04:20.560> vehicles<00:04:21.040> in<00:04:21.609> car<00:04:22.120> combat<00:04:22.389> and

engage other vehicles in car combat and
