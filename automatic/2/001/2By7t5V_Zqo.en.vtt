between<00:03:37.720> those<00:03:38.080> legs<00:03:38.760> okay<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:39.820> my<00:03:40.060> guess<00:03:40.270> is<00:03:40.300> a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
between those legs okay so my guess is a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.450 
between those legs okay so my guess is a
boy<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.930> girl<00:03:40.960> but<00:03:41.530> I've<00:03:41.890> been<00:03:42.280> wrong

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
boy and a girl but I've been wrong

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.510 
boy and a girl but I've been wrong
before<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.890> shouldn't<00:03:45.160> buy<00:03:45.340> any

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
before so I think you shouldn't buy any
