00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.680
 Hello everyone and if you eat before 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.290
 people today we are going to analyze the music that 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.780
 it comes out when we die in individual mode 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.090
 in te mode when it came out in a 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.280
 principle we all said our theories 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.890
 thought we had about this and 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.590
 it was always said that well, that 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.480
 hinted at ham when we were 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.660
 in the world and that we would go back love 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.880
 that's what we said and what I said 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.130
 my theory at first when it came out 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.820
 a new baby but you know that 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.290
 as time goes on we go 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.060
 noticing things that we did not 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.730
 we could realize we could not 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.810
 see them and then it was given then 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.270
 its 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.160
 we can be able to get there 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.710
 beyond what in the beginning 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.700
 we could get to see 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.700
 let's analyze it let's see it and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 later I will tell you what I think of everything 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.970
 this 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.840
 to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.850
 as was being said at the beginning 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.790
 we all thought because this was 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.860
 allusion that we were going back to the world and 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.220
 let's go back to see the characters in 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.990
 a following dlc but we were 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.700
 wrong according to me and according to the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.670
 another day with the a to that the other video that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.360
 I've been talking about the importance 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.940
 of the cinematics of the trailers 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.940
 the small trailers made in white and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.560
 black that tell you important parts of 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.380
 this story 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 clear as normal there are things that still 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.950
 we can not understand is impossible 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.130
 but you are leaving clues about that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.790
 Well, this was precisely what was 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.330
 talking about that the importance of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 moon of that night that night of 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.150
 storm that night in which they 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.390
 the characters these tried to escape 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.350
 of that cursed night in which the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.010
 demon escaped from there so that 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.580
 that hex that something that still 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.790
 we can not understand it became a reality 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.830
 which I repeat was on that night in the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
 mons to see but that for some 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.220
 sure circumstance that for some 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.620
 some key thing in the prophecy were 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.110
 going 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.769
 of map on map of place place 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.010
 jumping from time to time and years 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.010
 in years because that is the great enigma 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.760
 I still do not know yet we do not know 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.310
 but with time we will discover it and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.750
 who will be behind that brand so 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.280
 important in history 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.280
 until the next video 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.129
 the types 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 Y
