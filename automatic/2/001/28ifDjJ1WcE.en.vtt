little<00:00:41.250> features<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.790> thought<00:00:42.000> were<00:00:42.120> really

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
little features I thought were really

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.330

pretty<00:00:42.540> cool<00:00:42.840> number<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.680> sits<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.129> pretty

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

quick<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> would<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.539> even<00:00:45.840> though<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
quick I would say I think even though I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
quick I would say I think even though I
didn't<00:00:46.320> even<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.530> who<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.829> doing<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.430> set

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
didn't even know who I was doing I set

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
didn't even know who I was doing I set
this<00:00:48.149> whole<00:00:48.360> thing<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.670> 15<00:00:50.670> minutes

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
this whole thing up in about 15 minutes

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.779 
this whole thing up in about 15 minutes
you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.280> sure<00:00:53.489> I'll<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.610> able<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you know and so I'm sure I'll be able to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.619 
you know and so I'm sure I'll be able to
get<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.030> down<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.480> 10<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.930> less<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:56.629> the

some<00:01:49.920> examples<00:01:50.460> some<00:01:50.880> downsides<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.899> I've

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
some examples some downsides I see I've

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
some examples some downsides I see I've
been<00:01:52.110> using<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> Cobra<00:01:52.829> crank<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.280> see<00:01:53.399> I've

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
been using the Cobra crank you see I've

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 
been using the Cobra crank you see I've
got<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> floor<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> Cobra

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
got here in the floor and the Cobra

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
got here in the floor and the Cobra
crane<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.770> very<00:01:56.040> good

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
crane is also very good

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
crane is also very good
there's<00:01:57.000> some<00:01:57.149> things<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.840> about

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
there's some things I don't like about

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.859 
there's some things I don't like about
some<00:01:58.409> things<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:59.060> from<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.540> plate

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
some things I do from one this plate

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
some things I do from one this plate
down<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> bottom<00:02:01.939> I've<00:02:02.939> been

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
down here on the bottom I've been

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.389 
down here on the bottom I've been
shooting<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.509> line<00:02:03.719> my<00:02:04.229> cranes<00:02:04.860> death<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
shooting on line my cranes death and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.570 
shooting on line my cranes death and
that<00:02:05.939> plate<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.659> little<00:02:07.079> lilliput<00:02:07.740> mounts

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that plate this little lilliput mounts

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.910 
that plate this little lilliput mounts
really<00:02:08.819> nicer<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.470> plate<00:02:10.739> when

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
really nicer to it and that plate when

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.460 
really nicer to it and that plate when
it's<00:02:11.039> mounted<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.790> and

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
it's mounted up on this and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.210 
it's mounted up on this and
fortunately<00:02:12.830> if<00:02:12.890> he's<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.130> big<00:02:13.750> bogan

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
fortunately if he's this big bogan

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.350 
fortunately if he's this big bogan
tripod<00:02:16.220> here<00:02:16.370> which<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.610> very<00:02:16.850> heavy<00:02:17.210> but

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
tripod here which is very heavy but

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.790 
tripod here which is very heavy but
that's<00:02:17.510> what<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.840> takes<00:02:18.020> to<00:02:18.230> support<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
that's what it takes to support the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.780 
that's what it takes to support the
weight<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.430> one<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> mount<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.580> on

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
weight of this one when I mount this on

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.910 
weight of this one when I mount this on
it<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.630> mounts<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:24.380> great<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.770> this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
it that mounts really great on this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.500 
it that mounts really great on this
right<00:02:25.130> here<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> stay<00:02:25.580> stationary<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.360> don't

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
right here you stay stationary I don't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.720 
right here you stay stationary I don't
see<00:02:26.660> any<00:02:26.900> way<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.710> take<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.490> put

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
see any way that I can take this and put

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360 
see any way that I can take this and put
it<00:02:28.820> on<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.290> any<00:02:30.290> chip<00:02:30.620> I've<00:02:30.800> also<00:02:30.950> been<00:02:31.160> using

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
it on the any chip I've also been using

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.450 
it on the any chip I've also been using
the<00:02:31.490> best<00:02:31.730> core<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:33.320> go<00:02:33.440> left<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.890> right<00:02:33.950> I'm

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
the best core to go left and right I'm

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.760 
the best core to go left and right I'm
over<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:35.060> Rocking<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.960> hook<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.560> up

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
over there Rocking you know hook that up

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.310 
over there Rocking you know hook that up
mount<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.400> camera<00:02:37.580> on<00:02:37.760> top<00:02:37.970> turn<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.960> on<00:02:39.080> it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
mount the camera on top turn it on it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.380 
mount the camera on top turn it on it
because<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:40.070> know<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:40.940> I'm<00:02:41.090> able<00:02:41.240> to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
because you know it's like I'm able to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.170 
because you know it's like I'm able to
get<00:02:41.540> left<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:41.990> right<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.610> there's<00:02:44.030> no

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
get left and right and so there's no

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.330 
get left and right and so there's no
place<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.690> as<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.959> can<00:02:45.140> see<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.590> not<00:02:45.950> confuse

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
place really as I can see to not confuse

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.830 
place really as I can see to not confuse
the<00:02:46.490> best<00:02:46.670> core<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.209> end<00:02:47.360> out<00:02:47.540> here

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
the best core on the end out here

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.690 
the best core on the end out here
there's<00:02:48.110> no<00:02:48.260> doubt<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> could<00:02:48.620> use<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.640> I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
there's no doubt I could use that and I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120 
there's no doubt I could use that and I
could<00:02:50.090> use<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.990> remote<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.800> strain

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
could use the remote for it and strain

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.960 
could use the remote for it and strain
the<00:02:52.280> wires<00:02:52.490> across<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.150> no<00:02:53.810> problem<00:02:54.970> so

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the wires across this no problem so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.640 
the wires across this no problem so
maybe<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.420> best<00:02:56.450> core<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.990> an<00:02:57.080> option<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.530> just

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
maybe the best core is an option I just

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.920 
maybe the best core is an option I just
don't<00:02:57.770> see<00:02:57.890> how<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.160> mount<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.930> monitor

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
don't see how I can mount the monitor

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.260 
don't see how I can mount the monitor
but<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.530> know<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.640> can<00:03:01.820> see<00:03:02.030> these

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
but you know what you can see these

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.190 
but you know what you can see these
monitors<00:03:02.750> on<00:03:02.870> these<00:03:03.020> new<00:03:04.540> HfG<00:03:05.540> tens<00:03:05.810> pretty

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
monitors on these new HfG tens pretty

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.180 
monitors on these new HfG tens pretty
well<00:03:08.050> even<00:03:09.050> from<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.410> great<00:03:09.620> distance<00:03:10.070> of

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
well even from the great distance of

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.460 
well even from the great distance of
back<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.540> other<00:03:11.660> thing<00:03:11.900> too<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.170> you

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
back here the other thing too is you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.440 
back here the other thing too is you
know<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.680> lot<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:12.830> times<00:03:13.100> I'll<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.120> almost

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
know a lot of times I'll just almost

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.420 
know a lot of times I'll just almost
operate<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.200> camera<00:03:15.770> crane<00:03:15.980> from<00:03:16.190> this

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
operate the camera crane from this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.000 
operate the camera crane from this
position<00:03:16.820> right<00:03:16.910> here<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.720> try<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.709> get<00:03:18.890> those

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
position right here and try to get those

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.790 
position right here and try to get those
very<00:03:19.220> subtle<00:03:19.700> moves<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.209> way<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:21.590> I'm<00:03:21.650> up

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
very subtle moves that way so I'm up

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.850 
very subtle moves that way so I'm up
here<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.130> end<00:03:22.310> anyway<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.790> could<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:23.860> you

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
here on this end anyway I could just you

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.410 
here on this end anyway I could just you
know<00:03:24.890> do<00:03:25.160> some<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.550> control<00:03:25.940> things<00:03:26.300> that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
know do some of the control things that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.970 
know do some of the control things that
I<00:03:26.480> typically<00:03:26.870> would<00:03:27.080> do<00:03:27.260> from<00:03:27.380> way<00:03:27.560> back<00:03:27.739> on

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
I typically would do from way back on

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.530 
I typically would do from way back on
the<00:03:28.100> end<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.489> right<00:03:28.670> up<00:03:28.790> here<00:03:28.970> from<00:03:29.180> in<00:03:29.269> front

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
the end just right up here from in front

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
there that keeps it all level now

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.770 
there that keeps it all level now
everything<00:03:42.920> would<00:03:43.040> move<00:03:43.190> level<00:03:43.610> I'll<00:03:44.600> walk

number<00:04:08.060> one<00:04:08.569> here<00:04:08.930> there<00:04:09.110> are<00:04:09.230> actually<00:04:09.410> two

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
number one here there are actually two

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.790 
number one here there are actually two
more<00:04:10.550> holes<00:04:10.850> down<00:04:11.180> here<00:04:11.240> it<00:04:11.990> with<00:04:12.290> me<00:04:12.530> inside

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
more holes down here it with me inside

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.559 
more holes down here it with me inside
it<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.100> I<00:04:13.160> could<00:04:13.310> pull<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:13.640> pin<00:04:13.970> out<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.390> one

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
it so I could pull this pin out if I one

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.390 
it so I could pull this pin out if I one
two<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:14.990> raise<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.709> whole<00:04:15.920> thing<00:04:16.220> up

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
two and raise this whole thing up

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.509 
two and raise this whole thing up
another<00:04:16.760> probably<00:04:17.120> she<00:04:18.109> you<00:04:18.530> know<00:04:18.560> foot<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
another probably she you know foot and a

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.680 
another probably she you know foot and a
half<00:04:19.700> anyway<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:21.140> no<00:04:22.100> problem<00:04:22.550> going<00:04:22.790> from

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
half anyway so no problem going from

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.440 
half anyway so no problem going from
ground<00:04:24.020> level<00:04:24.640> all<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.700> way<00:04:25.940> down<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.300> that

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
ground level all the way down to that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.520 
ground level all the way down to that
well<00:04:26.570> you<00:04:26.690> know<00:04:26.810> if<00:04:26.870> I<00:04:27.020> can<00:04:27.140> get<00:04:27.260> about<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.470> foot

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
well you know if I can get about a foot

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.570 
well you know if I can get about a foot
off<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:27.950> ground

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
off the ground

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.080 
off the ground
I<00:04:28.750> could<00:04:29.750> probably<00:04:29.900> reverse<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:31.090> bracket

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
I could probably reverse that bracket

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.850 
I could probably reverse that bracket
there<00:04:32.270> too<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.900> go<00:04:33.050> all<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.320> way<00:04:33.350> down<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.770> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
there too and go all the way down to the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.240 
there too and go all the way down to the
ground<00:04:34.390> but<00:04:35.390> stealing<00:04:36.350> here's<00:04:36.740> about<00:04:36.950> nine

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
ground but stealing here's about nine

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.990 
ground but stealing here's about nine
and<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.669> half<00:04:37.700> feet<00:04:38.240> high<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:39.280> that's<00:04:40.280> not<00:04:40.580> even

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
and a half feet high so that's not even

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.020 
and a half feet high so that's not even
and<00:04:41.600> we're<00:04:41.750> not<00:04:41.870> even<00:04:42.050> probably<00:04:42.700> are<00:04:43.700> we<00:04:43.850> even

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
and we're not even probably are we even

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.110 
and we're not even probably are we even
sixty<00:04:44.720> degrees<00:04:45.020> here<00:04:45.380> probably<00:04:45.800> not<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.400> could

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
sixty degrees here probably not I could

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.030 
sixty degrees here probably not I could
I<00:04:47.300> think<00:04:47.480> I<00:04:47.540> could<00:04:47.720> clearly<00:04:48.260> go<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.830> raise

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
I think I could clearly go if I raise

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.930 
I think I could clearly go if I raise
the<00:04:49.190> set<00:04:49.430> 14<00:04:50.030> feet<00:04:50.300> high<00:04:50.330> down<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.050> ground

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
the set 14 feet high down to the ground

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.760 
the set 14 feet high down to the ground
so<00:04:52.940> I'm<00:04:53.030> kind<00:04:53.300> of<00:04:53.360> digging<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:54.790> pretty<00:04:55.790> sweet

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
so I'm kind of digging it pretty sweet

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.890 
so I'm kind of digging it pretty sweet
little<00:04:57.770> camera<00:04:58.250> crane<00:04:58.520> set<00:04:58.820> up<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.210> Indy<00:04:59.660> jib

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
little camera crane set up the Indy jib

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.590 
little camera crane set up the Indy jib
and<00:05:00.230> I<00:05:00.980> will<00:05:01.160> throw<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.880> few<00:05:02.180> pieces<00:05:02.360> of
