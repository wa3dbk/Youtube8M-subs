00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 Welcome to another video here in my 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 channel and today staff talk about 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 matter a little unexpected, but 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 extremely important as you saw there 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.449
 the video title has already given notice to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 That's a very serious matter, right? 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 good guys some time ago for who 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 follow us on Twitter so much 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.040
 I, how many others youtuber if you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
 will know about what happened on 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 a top 5 that rolled and on the channel Sunday 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 games I do not know if you remember what 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 boy who appeared in the top 5 was 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 Stopping with the channel and very dissatisfied 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.530
 with everything in life he decided to apply the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.629
 strike the flash in the Sunday and old video 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 they were unable to do 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.829
 there and saw video program for a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.239
 period of six months thanks to God 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.250
 through contacts I listened to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.230
 say they have managed to make it so 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 got that strike that was 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 on their channel so this is very good, right? 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 and we hope it does not come 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280
 happen to them as well as to any 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 another and October because this really is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.939
 very boring good people for those who do not know 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.040
 I have a series on the channel called top 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.049
 5 plays which by the way is a good 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.000
 stopped and old time was a series that 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.470
 You fucking liked it, it was a series. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.939
 I also confess to you that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.580
 It was hard work to make it ride. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.500
 select videos and make a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 Nice edition that pleases you. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 I work but I liked enough 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.330
 bring because the return was very big 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.950
 good but finally now that of a 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.240
 Loose in things because my life 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.350
 I was pretty racing, I'm 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.420
 managing to make this video here to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 You and put things in order the top 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 five moves of the channel can continue 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 people but because of this because I've seen 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.710
 things happen as well as extracts that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.509
 It will happen in the nest games I prefer 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.009
 avoid my channel so I can're 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.110
 accepting more videos from anyone 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.670
 Who just sent video who knows 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 one day the person revolts against 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.000
 me or even play for fun 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 me the staff downstairs to see a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.840
 annoying person applies the damage who 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.520
 You know even a flat in the video so do not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.380
 I want this to happen to the channel I 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.759
 I never took streck for nothing. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.500
 I assure you that I should take 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.149
 I would be very annoyed to know what 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.549
 to do then, on account of that, I want 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.259
 to know of you what I do I continue 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
 toxics thrown by I'll work out a 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 the image condition term in which each 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.239
 participant who went to see me the video goes 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.160
 have to fill this term by claiming 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.690
 which authorizes the right of his image from the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.110
 video so that future problems do not 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.600
 come with 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
 or just definitely ended up 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.470
 series here we already have almost 15 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.060
 episodes and old was a series that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.220
 really changed a lot in my 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 channel and owe everything to her and all of you. 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.540
 continued then I'll leave two 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.610
 comments in the video saying if I 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.050
