 god bless the weekly Mediterranean diet the irreplaceable sex 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.730
 also in the field of nutrition 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 important studies have also been done online that we see what has 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.099
 discovered ours 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 the solemn patrician schisa falls 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.369
 today we have 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.489
 cooked a dish 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.489
 based on cereals and legumes 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.830
 barossa favorite diet because the diet that in all the peoples of the world 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.150
 men eat 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.550
 a brown rice 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 with vegetables and with sesame seeds 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.880
 a bit of lentils 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.229
 and then we find the mixed vegetables 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.379
 at the pink farmstead campus and the tumor institute 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.559
 done gaultier 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.590
 years of cooks preparing menus of natural foods 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 the purpose of our work and cancer prevention through 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.350
 supply 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.970
 and on this table we see 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.530
 at many types of cereals and many types of legumes but as we also see bread is 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 allowed to accompany these basic lunches with bread except you text 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.019
 We put this bread 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.130
 to show 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.700
 bells that are not good if you see this is a fake wholemeal bread made with the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 refined white flour I purchased addition 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.470
 handful of bran so we have the damage of the refined flour for the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.130
 bran damage is much better if you want to eat bread and eat bread 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.940
 which was eaten once though I fear tibes leavened wholemeal bread 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.940
 natural of vengeful 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.580
 many tumors are linked to food, cancer support 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.040
 of the digestive system lung die and breast tumors are those there 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560
 we take more care 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.789
 but those what sad we do these studies here we follow 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.420
 hundreds of thousands of people who gave us blood samples yes 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:51.630
 call in time to see who gets cancer not getting sick 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.830
 angela seek the demo differences since 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.140
 people who have high levels of insulin in the blood of certain hormones 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.770
 get sick more now and then with the power we do in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.470
 way 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.200
 to keep these hormones low resulted in showing that we can keep them 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.060
 low and from these results that the idea of ​​going to change ours was born 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.029
 internal environment by changing the power supply 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.269
 the first studies of mathematical analysis diana + direct diet and androgens 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.689
 pec women who have androgens in the male high male sex hormones 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.779
 love each other more than breast cancer have shown us that it is possible to change 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.079
 the internal absorbent changing feeding spoke to her about tumors 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.400
 dependent formol this therefore concerns breast cancer because 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.369
 one of the biggest killers for women but it also concerns however other looks 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.260
 also prostate cancer and concerns 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.840
 for this type of limitation we believe it is very important for tumors 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 of the digestive system also to protect us from tumors of the apparatus 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680
 digestive 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.409
 and we recommend avoiding animal food in general 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.409
 not only in everyday life but also in monthly payments 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.989
 preserved meats 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.340
 mechanically Saturday ie cured meats and canned meats these things would be own 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.879
 to avoid but 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.109
 and bay especially to drink sugary drinks 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.979
 if on the label it is written that sugar was added to the age the 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.019
 fruit juice 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.519
 itis max conte fruit lamma I make the photo is good there is no need for love 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.809
 sugar 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:16.929
 Here is a trap, however, because if we read it 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.869
 without sugar maybe then they put sweeteners in by who should 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.149
 be nothing to sweeten so sweet 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:27.019
 so beware also 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.749
 be especially wary of the stuff called glucose fructose syrup 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.999
 is suspected of being the leading cause of the obesity epidemic in the United States 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.389
 united states tesla put up everywhere 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.809
 even in beverages half especially in the pastry shop but also beware of the 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:46.009
 artificial sweeteners there is no evidence that they are good for those who 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.840
 for those who are overweight, or rather, for suspicious purposes, we are fattening 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:51.229
 at the end of the - ideal 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.060
 chapter 12 today biscuits 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 to the pink farmhouse 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.339
 we take care that there are few very simple ingredients not there 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.159
 simplicity is the best thing 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.839
 a refined non-African flour these are the flour 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.009
 of type 2 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.429
 friday sicuro type 2 was placed 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.590
 I never get flour 0 0 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.280
 and then fattening is given by almonds dalì hazelnuts I feel a roguish sun 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.050
 eldo lecce 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.460
 fruit diet in particular from 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.600
 here there is a little sultan there is no sugar here you can play nothing 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.379
 sweet 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.469
 yet certainly sweet, however, of biscuits or not, there is only cinema 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.280
 extrasystole flour 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.479
 also other elements 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.180
 I will work 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.809
 we prefer to use 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.509
 almonds 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.809
 but that goes up the doors 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:53.039
 you have to count something that links the eggs 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.780
 now we are present soy milk
