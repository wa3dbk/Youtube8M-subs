00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 find out how to make this macaw braid 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.510
 in a way different from the way 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.200
 traditional this new method is super 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:19.080
 practical and easy to do, relying on it 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.930
 traditional you would have to lean to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.730
 Customer's head looks you too have 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.029
 that lean towards it being 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 uncomfortable for both you and your 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.590
 the customer because you have to reach 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.480
 first there the ear that is opposite 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.800
 You and this new method will be the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.270
 otherwise you start with the ear that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 is close to you to do this. 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.579
 first you divide the hair more or 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.609
 less in the middle and will divide 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.730
 ear to ear 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.729
 separating this region you will use 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.640
 to make the transition 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.270
 After doing this, you 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 remaining hair so that you do not 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 hindering your work 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 now separate the mecha near the ear 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.640
 that is close to you with more or less 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.869
 a finger of thickness and life 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.439
 remaining hair in the middle of the hair 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.700
 low due to hair in three strokes and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.220
 start making a built-in braid 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.030
 after frigging the first three 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 wicks 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 See how I add more hair to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.720
 the middle wick with two sides 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.790
 I use the index finger to separate 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 the wicks on the side and will lead to the middle 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.579
 see here I'm braiding 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.090
 embedded 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.420
 but not of the inverse france method 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.970
 because the hair is above the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.150
 My hands, but cool it. 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 And you're really braiding. 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.050
 built-in reverse 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.820
 I'll show you some of them here. 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.320
 seconds but look like Grandma 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.560
 adding the wicks on the side because it is 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.130
 important you learn is a way 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.620
 well comfortable cool to do and now 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.800
 look there is the result 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.970
 as you see it is a reverse braid 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.340
 embedded 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.459
 although it seems that you pass 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.580
 simply the built-in braid 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.360
 but this is the trick or the magic of 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.310
 Very cool song when you get in the middle. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.390
 you go to the other side of the client and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.450
 will finish my moth up until 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.780
 the ear the opposite doing 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.470
 traditionally the reverse braid 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.800
 and you will do so because 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.550
 now the hair is under your 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.720
 hands 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.989
 so you can do normally go 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.050
 be comfortable for you the customer 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.690
 And the braid will stay the whole time. 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.260
 very beautiful uniform 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.600
 I'll show you how to do the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.330
 transition looks from side to side 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 Note that I'm doing the braid now. 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.380
 inlaid way interests 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.380
 traditional 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.070
 I'll show it again for you to see. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.640
 and start over again when you 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.060
 Pass the other side You get the same 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:07.630
 ments the law usually continues with 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:12.160
 braiding in reverse the way 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.810
 the traditional as we speak so far 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.169
 you end up again and do is also the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.140
 hairstyle the way you want will 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.139
 show him how every child gets very 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:33.430
 well done in uniform to start 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.230
 I hope you have to do it now. 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.510
 to finish 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.530
 As I said, you end up like that. 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.240
 want to 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:49.270
 if so then I simply holds 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:53.560
 braid with a fuse behind as I think 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.530
 because of silicone and only has hair and 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.430
 I'm going there, you ready this very hairstyle 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:05.860
 beautiful looks beautiful and straight hair the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.979
 curly hair and there it is negative 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.910
 I hope you liked it, thank you. 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.910
 to watch
