full six inches that you want you for
the<00:03:56.310> year<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:56.760> let's<00:03:57.239> minimize<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:58.170> trimming

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the year so let's minimize the trimming

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.800 
the year so let's minimize the trimming
and<00:03:58.769> we<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.790> by<00:03:59.970> minimizing<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and we can do that by minimizing the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.830 
and we can do that by minimizing the
breakage<00:04:01.260> being<00:04:01.920> gentle<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.820> brushing<00:04:03.690> it

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
breakage being gentle to it brushing it

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.560 
breakage being gentle to it brushing it
gently<00:04:04.200> putting<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.220> up<00:04:05.400> if<00:04:05.609> we<00:04:05.760> have<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.239> so

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
gently putting it up if we have to so

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.509 
gently putting it up if we have to so
that<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.959> avoid<00:04:07.200> tangling<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.859> situations

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
