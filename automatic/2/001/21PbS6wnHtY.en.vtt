00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you kind of have to play with this a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
you kind of have to play with this a
little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.989> perfect<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.989> kind

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
little bit to get it perfect so you kind

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.460 
little bit to get it perfect so you kind
of<00:01:01.710> push<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.280> fabric<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> top<00:01:03.470> pin

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
of push down the fabric on the top pin

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
of push down the fabric on the top pin
that<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.769> place<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.930> come<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:11.000> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that in place and then come around to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.320 
that in place and then come around to
the<00:01:12.119> front<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.630> look<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.110> how<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.560> looks<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the front and look at how it looks and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
the front and look at how it looks and
this<00:01:15.330> will<00:01:15.540> determine<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:16.259> much<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
this will determine how much more you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:27.660 
this will determine how much more you
need<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.189> push<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:17.729> place

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.820 

and<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.390> whole<00:01:28.540> point<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.200> want<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.590> line

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
and the whole point is you want to line

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.140 
and the whole point is you want to line
up<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.490> fabric<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:33.280> both<00:01:33.520> me<00:01:33.909> in

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
up the fabric so that they both me in

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.550 
up the fabric so that they both me in
the<00:01:34.420> center<00:01:34.780> but<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.960> they're<00:01:38.170> equal

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
the center but that they're equal

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.240 
the center but that they're equal
distances<00:01:39.100> apart<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.790> this<00:01:39.939> case<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
distances apart so in this case the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.850 
distances apart so in this case the
bottom<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.820> a<00:01:42.909> little<00:01:43.330> bit<00:01:43.450> too<00:01:43.899> far<00:01:44.289> out<00:01:44.530> so

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
bottom is a little bit too far out so

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.230 
bottom is a little bit too far out so
we're<00:01:45.039> going<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.220> take<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.789> little<00:01:45.820> bit

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
we're going to take it in a little bit

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.450 
we're going to take it in a little bit
and<00:01:46.479> again<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.350> just<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.830> play<00:01:48.039> with<00:01:48.250> it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
and again you just have to play with it

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.880 
and again you just have to play with it
it<00:01:48.850> takes<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.240> little<00:01:49.420> bit<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.630> practice<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.649> get

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
it takes a little bit of practice to get

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.429 
it takes a little bit of practice to get
this<00:01:51.729> bound<00:01:52.060> buttonhole<00:01:52.360> perfect<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.320> when

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
this bound buttonhole perfect so when

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.649 
this bound buttonhole perfect so when
you<00:01:53.619> are<00:01:53.649> going<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.220> attempt<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.549> do<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:54.939> try

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
you are going to attempt to do this try

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.570 
you are going to attempt to do this try
it<00:01:55.720> out<00:01:55.930> on<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.110> piece<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.439> scrap<00:01:56.890> fabric<00:01:57.130> first

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
it out on a piece of scrap fabric first

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.550 
it out on a piece of scrap fabric first
don't<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:58.450> go<00:01:58.570> straight<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.990> your<00:01:59.140> garment

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
don't just go straight to your garment

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.899 
don't just go straight to your garment
because<00:01:59.710> it<00:01:59.979> does<00:02:00.159> take<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> little<00:02:00.670> bit<00:02:00.819> of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
because it does take a little bit of

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.990 
because it does take a little bit of
practice<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.569> get<00:02:01.720> this
