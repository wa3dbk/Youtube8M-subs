 how to paint your toenails 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:11.409
 when the hot days arrive 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.249
 women start wearing sandals 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.339
 leaving your feet more in sight 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.769
 this is why they can not neglect the beauty of their feet and should lend 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.369
 attention to the nails 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 In this video we show you how to paint your toenails 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.559
 The first thing you should do is be more than one list 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 make sure you say there are no imperfections 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.570
 then villegas with acetone 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 if they have residues of an old enamel 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.910
 It is very important that you use a separator between your fingers 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 to prevent the paint from skipping 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 here we will show you two ways to paint tÃ©lam 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.389
 yes not the first 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.770
 It is with red enamel to add a touch of glamor to your feet 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.140
 do not carry a lot of brush and start with the central part of the union 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.810
 after 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.540
 the laterals 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.299
 once you have painted all the nails left to dry 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.799
 for at least ten minutes before putting on any footwear 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.590
 the other option is to remove the Frenchwoman with an average of one plant in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.720
 tip 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.480
 for that you must first paint the white line on the tip of the unit 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 and then apply a transparent glaze 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.120
 above the whole union 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.150
 you should let it dry for at least ten minutes 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.010
 in this way 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.310
 your feet will look impeccable with your favorite santalices
