about<00:00:06.509> what<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.440> disliked<00:00:07.950> about<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.340> nexus<00:00:08.639> 7

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
about what I disliked about the nexus 7

about what I disliked about the nexus 7
now<00:00:09.510> start<00:00:09.900> off<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:11.480> what<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> disliked<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
now start off with what I disliked is

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.950 
now start off with what I disliked is
the<00:00:13.410> screen<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.700> screen<00:00:14.849> if<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> look<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the screen the screen if you look at the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.450 
the screen the screen if you look at the
resolution<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> resolution<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.160> really

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
resolution the resolution is really

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
resolution the resolution is really
great<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> didn't<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
great but what I didn't like about the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.150 
great but what I didn't like about the
screen<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.420> use<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.750> IPS<00:00:22.350> LCD<00:00:22.590> panel

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
screen is that they use an IPS LCD panel

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
screen is that they use an IPS LCD panel
although<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> has<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> wide<00:00:24.720> viewing<00:00:25.080> angle

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
although it has a wide viewing angle

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
although it has a wide viewing angle
it's<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> best<00:00:27.090> colors<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
it's not really the best colors and a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.279 
it's not really the best colors and a
color<00:00:28.859> saturation<00:00:29.400> contrast<00:00:29.849> ratio<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
color saturation contrast ratio the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
color saturation contrast ratio the
brightness<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> also<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> best<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
brightness is also not the best so I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.450 
brightness is also not the best so I
think<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.500> could<00:00:34.770> really<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.219> have

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
think in they could really really have

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
think in they could really really have
improved<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.329> screen<00:00:36.690> by<00:00:37.170> including<00:00:37.559> maybe<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
improved the screen by including maybe a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
improved the screen by including maybe a
super<00:00:38.250> amulet<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.879> Super<00:00:39.270> AMOLED<00:00:39.329> HD<00:00:39.660> super

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
super amulet or Super AMOLED HD super

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
super amulet or Super AMOLED HD super
amoled<00:00:40.440> plus<00:00:41.300> its<00:00:42.300> place<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> yeah<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> was

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
amoled plus its place so yeah this was

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
amoled plus its place so yeah this was
the<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:45.780> thing<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> didn't<00:00:46.559> really

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
the first thing that I didn't really
like<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> Nexus<00:00:47.910> 7<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.110> second<00:00:49.379> thing

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
like on the Nexus 7 the second thing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.110 
like on the Nexus 7 the second thing
that<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> didn't<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> limited<00:00:50.789> storage

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that I didn't like was a limited storage

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170 
that I didn't like was a limited storage
as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> nexus<00:00:52.949> 7<00:00:53.190> comes<00:00:53.370> 8gb<00:00:53.910> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of space for installing apps documents

movies photos songs etc so it's very

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
movies photos songs etc so it's very
limiting<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> furthermore<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.689> didn't<00:01:06.930> even

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
limiting and furthermore you didn't even

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
limiting and furthermore you didn't even
have<00:01:07.229> expandable<00:01:07.950> microsd<00:01:08.640> card<00:01:08.880> slot<00:01:08.970> to

have expandable microsd card slot to
expand<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.930> story<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> were<00:01:10.860> stuck<00:01:11.159> with

expand your story so you were stuck with

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.160 
expand your story so you were stuck with
the<00:01:11.430> five<00:01:11.640> gb<00:01:11.880> inbuilt<00:01:12.180> storage<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.960> eight

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the five gb inbuilt storage with eight

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
the five gb inbuilt storage with eight
kick<00:01:13.409> model<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.729> yeah<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
kick model so yeah a little bit of a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
kick model so yeah a little bit of a
bummer<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.479> they<00:01:18.750> would<00:01:18.900> have

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bummer and I I think if they would have

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.120 
bummer and I I think if they would have
included<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:20.689> microSD<00:01:21.689> card<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.920> would

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
included maybe a microSD card it would

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
included maybe a microSD card it would
really<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> worth<00:01:24.360> much<00:01:24.689> more

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
really really make it worth much more

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
really really make it worth much more
and<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.920> make<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> user<00:01:26.400> experience

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and it would make the user experience

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.080 
and it would make the user experience
much<00:01:27.270> higher<00:01:27.540> than<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.850> yeah<00:01:29.850> this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
much higher than what it is yeah this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.460 
much higher than what it is yeah this
was<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> second<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.020> disliked

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
was the second thing that I disliked

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
was the second thing that I disliked
about<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> nexus<00:01:32.189> 7<00:01:32.520> lack<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.210> expandable

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
about the nexus 7 lack of expandable

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.730 
about the nexus 7 lack of expandable
storage<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> limited<00:01:34.920> inbuilt<00:01:35.549> storage

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
storage and the limited inbuilt storage

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.230 
storage and the limited inbuilt storage
another<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> dislike<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
another thing that I dislike is the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
another thing that I dislike is the
camera<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.400> Nexus<00:01:41.700> 7<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
camera as you know the Nexus 7 is a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.889 
camera as you know the Nexus 7 is a
7-inch<00:01:42.450> tablet<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:44.240> asset<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.360> Google<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
7-inch tablet and asset by Google and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.889 
7-inch tablet and asset by Google and
next<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.649> Asus<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.790> 7-inch<00:01:48.240> tablets<00:01:48.630> don't

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
next and Asus that 7-inch tablets don't

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
next and Asus that 7-inch tablets don't
need<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> front<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.740> rear<00:01:50.220> facing<00:01:50.250> camera<00:01:50.939> I

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
need a front a rear facing camera I

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
need a front a rear facing camera I
really<00:01:51.780> disagree<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.950> feel<00:01:53.939> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
really disagree because I feel that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.139 
really disagree because I feel that
having<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> camera<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.670> tablet<00:01:56.670> makes<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
having the camera on tablet makes it

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
having the camera on tablet makes it
much<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.570> handy<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> mix<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.130> user

the<00:02:23.350> tablet<00:02:23.680> wooden<00:02:23.920> would<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.700> really

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the tablet wooden would really really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.520 
the tablet wooden would really really
have<00:02:25.120> made<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.540> experience<00:02:26.080> much<00:02:26.500> more

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
have made the experience much more

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.510 
have made the experience much more
better<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.190> user<00:02:29.040> another<00:02:30.040> thing<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.340> I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
better for the user another thing that I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.510 
better for the user another thing that I
disliked<00:02:30.940> about<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.330> tablet<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> lack

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
disliked about this tablet is the lack

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.330 
disliked about this tablet is the lack
of<00:02:33.550> removable<00:02:34.120> battery<00:02:34.930> now<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.500> battery

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
of removable battery now the battery

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.920 
of removable battery now the battery
although<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.090> battery<00:02:37.390> life<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.570> really

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
although the battery life is really

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.390 
although the battery life is really
great<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.550> lack<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.800> access<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.130> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
great on this the lack of access to the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.640 
great on this the lack of access to the
battery<00:02:42.580> makes<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.390> impossible<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.410> change

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
battery makes it impossible to change

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.290 
battery makes it impossible to change
the<00:02:44.830> battery<00:02:45.160> obviously<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:45.940> case<00:02:46.120> your

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
the battery obviously so in case your

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.540 
the battery obviously so in case your
battery<00:02:46.600> gets<00:02:46.780> damaged<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.620> anything<00:02:47.710> or<00:02:48.190> in

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
battery gets damaged or anything or in

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.460 
battery gets damaged or anything or in
case<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.000> want<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.210> you<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.140> run<00:02:50.320> out<00:02:50.440> of

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
case you want to you you run out of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.960 
case you want to you you run out of
battery<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.010> want<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> replace<00:02:51.610> your<00:02:51.850> battery

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
battery and want to replace your battery

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.090 
battery and want to replace your battery
or<00:02:52.330> if<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.810> travel<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.230> lot<00:02:53.380> it's<00:02:53.830> really

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
or if you travel a lot it's really

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.790 
or if you travel a lot it's really
really<00:02:54.970> really<00:02:55.120> inconvenient<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.260> to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
really really inconvenient for you to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.080 
really really inconvenient for you to
basically<00:02:57.100> have<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.610> charge<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.000> again

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
basically have to charge it again

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.090 
basically have to charge it again
instead<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.840> popping<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.770> new<00:02:59.920> battery

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
instead of just popping in a new battery

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.310 
instead of just popping in a new battery
so<00:03:00.970> yeah<00:03:01.150> although<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> battery<00:03:02.110> life<00:03:02.260> is

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
so yeah although the battery life is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.430 
so yeah although the battery life is
great<00:03:02.980> i<00:03:03.250> would<00:03:03.760> say<00:03:03.940> having<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.780> replaceable

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
great i would say having a replaceable

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.550 
great i would say having a replaceable
battery<00:03:05.770> would<00:03:06.310> have<00:03:06.550> made<00:03:06.790> nexus<00:03:07.570> 7<00:03:07.930> or<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
battery would have made nexus 7 or the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.360 
battery would have made nexus 7 or the
more<00:03:08.740> great<00:03:10.110> other<00:03:11.110> than<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.440> i<00:03:11.830> read<00:03:12.160> don't

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
more great other than that i read don't

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.310 
more great other than that i read don't
really<00:03:12.580> find<00:03:12.850> anything<00:03:13.570> missing<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.230> it

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
really find anything missing on it

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.410 
really find anything missing on it
although<00:03:14.980> i<00:03:15.010> would<00:03:15.310> say<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:16.209> lack<00:03:16.390> of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
although i would say that the lack of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.260 
although i would say that the lack of
the<00:03:16.959> 3g<00:03:17.440> variant<00:03:17.590> on<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.640> also<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.970> bit<00:03:19.150> of

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
the 3g variant on this is also a bit of

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.080 
the 3g variant on this is also a bit of
a<00:03:19.390> problem<00:03:19.420> since<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.190> Wi-Fi<00:03:21.640> only<00:03:21.670> as

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
a problem since it is a Wi-Fi only as

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.560 
a problem since it is a Wi-Fi only as
you<00:03:22.240> know<00:03:22.360> it's<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.930> Wi-Fi<00:03:23.290> only<00:03:23.350> device<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:24.570> it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
you know it's a Wi-Fi only device and it

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.330 
you know it's a Wi-Fi only device and it
has<00:03:25.750> really<00:03:25.780> limited<00:03:26.440> storage<00:03:26.709> when<00:03:27.220> you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
has really limited storage when you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.400 
has really limited storage when you
combine<00:03:27.490> these<00:03:27.940> two<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.660> don't<00:03:29.020> really<00:03:29.200> have

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
combine these two you don't really have

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.520 
combine these two you don't really have
much<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> options<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.459> storage<00:03:30.910> as<00:03:31.090> well<00:03:31.120> as

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
much of options with storage as well as

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.140 
much of options with storage as well as
you<00:03:32.530> can't<00:03:32.770> even<00:03:32.890> stream<00:03:33.280> content<00:03:33.550> onto<00:03:33.970> your

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
you can't even stream content onto your

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.510 
you can't even stream content onto your
device<00:03:34.270> say<00:03:35.080> if<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.440> have<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.010> use<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> lot

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
device say if you have if you use a lot

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.900 
device say if you have if you use a lot
of<00:03:36.580> cloud<00:03:36.880> storage<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.130> compensate<00:03:39.670> for

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
of cloud storage it to compensate for

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.580 
of cloud storage it to compensate for
the<00:03:39.970> lack<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.180> inbuilt<00:03:40.660> storage<00:03:40.990> on<00:03:41.470> this

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the lack of inbuilt storage on this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.560 
the lack of inbuilt storage on this
device<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.670> won't<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> option<00:03:43.540> to

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
device you won't have the option to

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.080 
device you won't have the option to
stream<00:03:44.320> it<00:03:44.560> or<00:03:44.770> while<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.220> go<00:03:45.250> you'll<00:03:45.940> have

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
stream it or while on the go you'll have
