00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
two different return fittings comes at

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.930 
two different return fittings comes at
elbows<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.810> some<00:00:22.199> straight<00:00:22.500> pipe

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940

hit it counterclockwise with a rubber
mallet<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:49.730> Puma<00:00:50.730> might<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.540> one<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
mallet a Puma might also have one and a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.630 
mallet a Puma might also have one and a
half<00:00:52.140> inch<00:00:52.320> return<00:00:52.590> lines<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> may<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
half inch return lines but it may have a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000 
half inch return lines but it may have a
fitting<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.540> top<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> threaded<00:00:55.470> part<00:00:55.710> like

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
fitting on top of the threaded part like

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.680 
fitting on top of the threaded part like
this<00:00:56.220> here<00:00:56.519> very<00:00:56.940> simple<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.449> need<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this here very simple you just need a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
this here very simple you just need a
pair<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.900> channel<00:00:58.260> locks<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.040> want<00:00:59.250> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
pair of channel locks now you want to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.170 
pair of channel locks now you want to
carefully<00:00:59.460> turn<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> counterclockwise<00:01:02.180> pull

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
carefully turn it counterclockwise pull

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.830 
carefully turn it counterclockwise pull
it<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.450> out<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.840> that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.389 

so<00:01:09.560> if<00:01:09.619> you're<00:01:09.740> installing<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.220> pool

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
so if you're installing the pool

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.920 
so if you're installing the pool
skimming<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.790> pool<00:01:11.000> with<00:01:11.149> just<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.390> stub<00:01:11.720> pipe

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
skimming a pool with just a stub pipe

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.990 
skimming a pool with just a stub pipe
like<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.350> here<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.649> no<00:01:12.740> threads<00:01:13.070> can<00:01:13.759> do<00:01:13.850> so

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
like this here with no threads can do so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.210 
like this here with no threads can do so
an<00:01:14.119> adapter<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.689> you<00:01:14.780> can<00:01:14.899> add<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:16.070> has

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
an adapter that you can add to it it has

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.920 
an adapter that you can add to it it has
threads<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.820> can<00:01:16.970> thread<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.450> pool<00:01:17.720> skim

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
threads on it you can thread a pool skim

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.499 
threads on it you can thread a pool skim
in<00:01:18.079> to<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:19.159> in<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.340> case<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.670> snub<00:01:19.939> pipes<00:01:20.210> in

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
in to so in the case of snub pipes in

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.910 
in to so in the case of snub pipes in
order<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.110> hook<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.380> up<00:01:21.470> you're<00:01:21.619> going<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.770> need

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
order to hook it up you're going to need

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.550 
order to hook it up you're going to need
the<00:01:22.039> polaris<00:01:22.549> types<00:01:23.390> an<00:01:23.539> extra<00:01:23.840> kit<00:01:24.079> help<00:01:24.409> this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the polaris types an extra kit help this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.080 
the polaris types an extra kit help this
right<00:01:24.799> here<00:01:24.979> is<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.100> one<00:01:25.310> inch<00:01:25.520> snub<00:01:25.850> pipe

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
right here is a one inch snub pipe

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.149 
right here is a one inch snub pipe
connector<00:01:26.630> see<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.409> has<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> one<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.009> half

on this adapter this is how I had it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.259 
on this adapter this is how I had it
configured<00:02:47.829> underwater<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.579> just<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.120> this

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
configured underwater and just like this

I'm<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> screws<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.079> there

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
I'm going to put the screws in there

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.979 
I'm going to put the screws in there
hold<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.129> place<00:02:51.480> let<00:02:52.480> me<00:02:52.540> attach<00:02:52.810> the

stainless<00:02:53.349> steel<00:02:53.560> screws<00:02:53.890> here<00:03:02.700> make<00:03:03.700> sure

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
stainless steel screws here make sure

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.369 
stainless steel screws here make sure
you<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.030> all<00:03:04.120> four<00:03:04.390> screws<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.959> should<00:03:05.349> be

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
you have all four screws on should be

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.869 
you have all four screws on should be
two<00:03:05.680> on<00:03:05.859> each<00:03:05.980> elbow<00:03:06.250> connection

so<00:03:11.599> in<00:03:11.689> this<00:03:11.780> case<00:03:11.989> since<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.379> so<00:03:12.469> close<00:03:12.499> to

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
so in this case since it's so close to

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:13.839 
so in this case since it's so close to
the<00:03:12.920> surface<00:03:13.219> I'm<00:03:13.280> just<00:03:13.459> going<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.640> use<00:03:13.730> this
