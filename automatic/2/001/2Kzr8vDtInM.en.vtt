hip<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.510> playing<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
hip because when you are playing on the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.860 
hip because when you are playing on the
pc<00:00:34.380> version<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:35.430> left<00:00:36.270> click<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.570> right

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
pc version your left click and right

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.299 
pc version your left click and right
click<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> fire<00:00:37.710> button<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.219> I'm

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
click are the fire button so I'm

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.410 
click are the fire button so I'm
guessing<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:38.910> you're<00:00:39.030> playing<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
guessing when you're playing on a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
guessing when you're playing on a
controller<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:40.680> left<00:00:41.340> trigger<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> right

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
controller your left trigger and right

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.670 
controller your left trigger and right
sugar<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> fire<00:00:43.230> each<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sugar will be to fire each of the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
sugar will be to fire each of the
weapons<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.280> fire<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.910> left<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
weapons you can fire the left one or the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
weapons you can fire the left one or the
right<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.930> independently<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.010> its

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
right one independently so that's its

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
right one independently so that's its
kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> think<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.600> when

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
kind of one way to think of it but when

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
kind of one way to think of it but when
I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.170> usually<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.190> spray<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> both

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
I'm going usually I'm just spray in both

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
I'm going usually I'm just spray in both
the<00:00:50.940> same<00:00:51.120> time<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.559> much

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the same time just get out as much

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
the same time just get out as much
damage<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.370> possible<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.270> know<00:00:54.390> pump<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.809> all

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
damage as possible you know pump out all

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630 
damage as possible you know pump out all
that<00:00:55.110> dps<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> hope<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that dps and it's kind of hope for the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
that dps and it's kind of hope for the
best<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> laser<00:00:57.629> sight<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.140> definitely

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
best so the laser sight is definitely

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
best so the laser sight is definitely
extremely<00:00:58.890> clutch<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> weapon<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> on

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
extremely clutch on this weapon and on

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.510 
extremely clutch on this weapon and on
most<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.379> weapons<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.949> game<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.280> far<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
most of my weapons in this game so far I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.939 
most of my weapons in this game so far I
really<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> suppressor<00:01:03.989> some<00:01:04.739> people

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
really like the suppressor some people

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.260 
really like the suppressor some people
call<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> silencer<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.909> doesn't<00:01:06.240> really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
call the silencer but doesn't really

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
call the silencer but doesn't really
make<00:01:06.510> everything<00:01:06.780> silent<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.320> kind<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
make everything silent just kind of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
make everything silent just kind of
suppresses<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.700> works<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.600> well

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
suppresses it it works out really well

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
suppresses it it works out really well
just<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.340> moving<00:01:11.760> around<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just because you are moving around so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.880 
just because you are moving around so
much<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> any<00:01:12.869> way<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.470> conceal

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
much that any way you can conceal

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710 
much that any way you can conceal
yourself<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> mini-map<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
yourself on the mini-map I think is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.080 
yourself on the mini-map I think is
important<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.619> lot<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> things<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.640> game<00:01:17.850> will

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
important a lot of things this game will

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.550 
important a lot of things this game will
give<00:01:18.270> away<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.659> position<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> main<00:01:19.380> map

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
give away your position on the main map

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
give away your position on the main map
such<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.310> XO<00:01:20.820> boost<00:01:21.090> around<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.960> one

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
such as when you XO boost around so one

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.960 
such as when you XO boost around so one
perk<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.979> use<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> blast

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
perk that you can use is the blast

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
perk that you can use is the blast
suppressor<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.470> use<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> don't

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
suppressor which I do use and I don't

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
suppressor which I do use and I don't
use<00:01:26.610> depending<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.180> who<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.509> playing<00:01:27.689> against

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
use depending on who I'm playing against
because<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.560> plan<00:01:28.770> against<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.220> players

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
because if your plan against new players

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
because if your plan against new players
they're<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.540> quite<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:32.240> trained<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.930> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
they're not quite as a trained to be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
they're not quite as a trained to be
looking<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> mini-map<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.729> times

maybe<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.640> really

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
maybe it just a little bit but really

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
maybe it just a little bit but really
looking<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> map<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.310> trying<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> figure

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
looking at the map and trying to figure

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
looking at the map and trying to figure
out<00:01:47.729> where<00:01:48.090> people<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.170> planning

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
out where people are and then planning

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.530 
out where people are and then planning
tactically<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.430> kind<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> knowing<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
tactically and kind of knowing the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.749 
tactically and kind of knowing the
angles<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
angles that is really what will put you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.840 
angles that is really what will put you
above<00:01:54.630> others<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.649> playing<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.250> shooter<00:01:56.610> game

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
above others when playing a shooter game

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.910 
above others when playing a shooter game
is<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.270> understanding<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> map<00:01:58.500> where

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
is really understanding the map where

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.700 
is really understanding the map where
others<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.969> relative<00:02:00.479> position<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
others are in a relative position to you

I<00:04:02.560> think<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.130> shooter<00:04:03.460> genre<00:04:03.490> is<00:04:04.180> really

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
I think the shooter genre is really

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.810 
I think the shooter genre is really
moving<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:05.050> think<00:04:05.590> this<00:04:05.800> is<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> warbird<00:04:06.520> that<00:04:06.760> I

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
moving I think this is a warbird that I

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.850 
moving I think this is a warbird that I
called<00:04:07.090> them<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.990> did<00:04:08.200> not<00:04:08.380> know<00:04:08.590> at<00:04:08.770> the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
called them and I did not know at the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.290 
called them and I did not know at the
time<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.280> could<00:04:09.430> change<00:04:09.580> weapons<00:04:09.820> the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
time that you could change weapons the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.790 
time that you could change weapons the
first<00:04:10.540> time<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.720> got<00:04:10.930> one<00:04:11.080> of<00:04:11.140> these<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:11.710> you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
first time I got one of these now you

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.050

can also move yourself so you can

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.430 
can also move yourself so you can
