little tutorial on a fast way to get the
overcharge<00:00:17.570> bounty<00:00:18.570> now<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> lot<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.619> after

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
overcharge bounty now a lot of you after

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670 
overcharge bounty now a lot of you after
seeing<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> I've<00:00:21.779> tried<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.410> figure<00:00:22.529> out

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
seeing this and I've tried to figure out

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
seeing this and I've tried to figure out
fast<00:00:22.859> ways<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> basically<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
fast ways to do it basically it's the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269 
fast ways to do it basically it's the
one<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.410> two<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.920> enemies

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
one where you get two or more enemies

with one fusion rifle shot 20 times and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.680 
with one fusion rifle shot 20 times and
if<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> moon<00:00:32.970> one<00:00:33.330> for

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
if you can get the moon one for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.560 
if you can get the moon one for
collecting<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.800> 200<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.969> helps<00:00:36.239> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
collecting the 200 things it helps it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
collecting the 200 things it helps it's
an<00:00:36.690> extra<00:00:36.930> 2,500<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.730> doing

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
an extra 2,500 because we will be doing

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.900 
an extra 2,500 because we will be doing
this<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> moon<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.399> basically<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
this on the moon now this is basically a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
this on the moon now this is basically a
really<00:00:42.210> quick<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.680> amount<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
really quick way to get a good amount of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
really quick way to get a good amount of
XP<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> balinese<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
XP if the balinese there so you want to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
XP if the balinese there so you want to
go<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> moon<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.950> want<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> select<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
go to moon and you want to select the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
go to moon and you want to select the
very<00:00:47.820> first<00:00:48.120> mission<00:00:48.480> she'll<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.230> called<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
very first mission she'll be called the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.130 
very first mission she'll be called the
dark<00:00:49.920> beyond<00:00:50.250> its<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.610> at<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:51.079> now<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
dark beyond its up at the top now the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.920 
dark beyond its up at the top now the
level<00:00:52.680> does<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:52.980> matter<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.700> you<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
level does not matter it's you want the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
level does not matter it's you want the
easier<00:00:55.260> level<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> fusion<00:00:56.280> rifle

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
easier level so that the fusion rifle

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.270 
easier level so that the fusion rifle
will<00:00:57.390> kill<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:58.020> than<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.010> shot

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
will kill more than one in one shot

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
will kill more than one in one shot
that's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.699> biggest<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
that's the biggest point that's the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's the biggest point that's the
challenge<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> put<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
challenge so you want to put it on a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.230 
challenge so you want to put it on a
hard<00:01:03.059> difficulty<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.640> basically<00:01:05.640> once<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
hard difficulty so basically once you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.370 
hard difficulty so basically once you
get<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.600> you're<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:06.899> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
get there you're gonna kind of have to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.719 
get there you're gonna kind of have to
play<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.979> you've<00:01:08.100> already<00:01:08.340> done<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> moon

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
play it if you've already done the moon

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.160 
play it if you've already done the moon
mission<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.270> basically<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:10.020> to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
