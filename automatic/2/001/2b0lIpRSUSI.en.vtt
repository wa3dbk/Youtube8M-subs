and<00:00:03.600> what<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.470> trying<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.740> do<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:04.980> just<00:00:05.130> dry

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
and what we're trying to do is just dry

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.360 
and what we're trying to do is just dry
brush<00:00:06.109> the<00:00:07.109> area<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:07.710> we<00:00:07.799> don't<00:00:07.950> have<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> do<00:00:08.340> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
brush the area so we don't have to do a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.160 
brush the area so we don't have to do a
lot<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> wiping<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:11.690> we'll<00:00:12.690> see<00:00:12.840> how<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.080> works

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
lot of wiping so we'll see how it works

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.580 
lot of wiping so we'll see how it works
now<00:00:13.349> we're<00:00:13.559> gonna<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> inside<00:00:14.610> first

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
now we're gonna do all the inside first

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.650 
now we're gonna do all the inside first
and<00:00:16.640> then<00:00:17.900> do<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> outsides<00:00:19.830> afterwards

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
and then do all the outsides afterwards

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
and then do all the outsides afterwards
when<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> wet<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.109> brush<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.800> wet<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.430> then

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
when I wet my brush I wet it and then

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.519 
when I wet my brush I wet it and then
dried<00:00:23.789> off<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> piece<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.900> cardboard<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
dried off on a piece of cardboard or a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
dried off on a piece of cardboard or a
rag<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.949> something<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.269> put<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> full

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
rag or something so I don't put a full

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.380 
rag or something so I don't put a full
wet<00:00:27.990> brush<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.029> areas

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
wet brush on there and then these areas

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.310 
wet brush on there and then these areas
here<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:35.270> these<00:00:36.270> areas<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> get

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
here so these areas here we want to get

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.860 
here so these areas here we want to get
our<00:00:37.410> brush<00:00:37.620> wet<00:00:37.829> enough<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> matches

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
our brush wet enough to where it matches

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
our brush wet enough to where it matches
the<00:00:40.350> intensity<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> side<00:00:41.579> panels<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> we

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the intensity of the side panels but we

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
the intensity of the side panels but we
don't<00:00:48.210> plan<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.570> wipe<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.079> any<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
don't plan to wipe it down any with the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.990 
don't plan to wipe it down any with the
rag<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> brush<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
rag which is going to use the brush to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
rag which is going to use the brush to
make<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> grain<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.530> neat<00:00:52.739> too<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.250> use

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
make the grain and if neat too I can use

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
make the grain and if neat too I can use
a<00:00:53.460> dry<00:00:53.820> brush<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.989> it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
a dry brush to do the same thing if it's

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.020 
a dry brush to do the same thing if it's
too<00:00:58.500> intense<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.960> so

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
too intense with this one here and so

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.969 
too intense with this one here and so
we're<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.120> find<00:01:03.510> our<00:01:03.719> way<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.090 

whatever<00:01:07.979> works<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.000> way<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.920> make

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
whatever works is the right way to make

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.130 
whatever works is the right way to make
sure<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> same<00:01:15.030> intensity<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:17.000> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
sure we get the same intensity as the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
sure we get the same intensity as the
side<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.560> where<00:01:19.740> I've<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.280> varnish

side now see where I've got the varnish

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.179 
side now see where I've got the varnish
you<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> corner<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.979> just

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you know here on the corner I can just

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.179 
you know here on the corner I can just
wipe<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.450> black

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
definitely will be using a another brush

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.440 
definitely will be using a another brush
it<00:02:05.220> may<00:02:05.310> give<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.520> example

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.110 

it's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.630> three-inch<00:02:10.170> orange<00:02:10.979> chip<00:02:11.370> brush

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.020 

 is<00:02:15.210> used<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.200> green

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
 is used this to make the green

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.070 
 is used this to make the green
and<00:02:18.740> it'll<00:02:19.740> be<00:02:19.860> fine<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.600> over<00:02:21.930> here

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and it'll be fine and just over here

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.630 
and it'll be fine and just over here

and<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.180> make<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.510> grain<00:02:24.740> again<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> doesn't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and just make the grain again it doesn't
