trip so yeah well we actually can right
now<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.730> surprising<00:02:33.299> however<00:02:33.660> go<00:02:33.959> John's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
now this is surprising however go John's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.100 
now this is surprising however go John's
not<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.940> well<00:02:36.750> actually<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
not here but well actually the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.750 
not here but well actually the
disappointing<00:02:37.680> thing<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.400> only<00:02:38.549> have

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
disappointing thing is that we only have

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
disappointing thing is that we only have
two<00:02:39.030> hours<00:02:39.060> worth<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.989> internet<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
two hours worth of internet and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.589 
two hours worth of internet and
basically<00:02:41.700> our<00:02:41.849> internet<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.330> called

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
basically our internet is called

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.720 
basically our internet is called
cellular<00:02:43.049> data<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.580> use<00:02:44.700> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
cellular data and we have to use that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.050 
cellular data and we have to use that
and<00:02:45.950> let's<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.040> say<00:02:47.250> we<00:02:47.549> can<00:02:47.670> only<00:02:47.819> be

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and let's just say we can only be

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.720 
and let's just say we can only be
connected<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.660> internet<00:02:48.989> for<00:02:49.170> two<00:02:49.319> hours

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
connected to the internet for two hours

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.479 
connected to the internet for two hours
so<00:02:50.730> yeah<00:02:51.599> that's<00:02:51.750> kind<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.140> makes<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.190> kind<00:02:53.430> of

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
so yeah that's kind of makes it kind of

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.130 
so yeah that's kind of makes it kind of
really<00:02:53.790> hard<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.209> record<00:02:54.510> videos<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.930> since

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
really hard to record videos and since

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.720 
really hard to record videos and since
it<00:02:55.260> already<00:02:55.440> takes<00:02:55.709> an<00:02:55.920> hour<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> upload<00:02:56.549> one

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
another screenshot this might be the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.839 
another screenshot this might be the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.370 
thumbnail alright we're crafting it
right<00:03:44.970> now<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.019> take<00:03:46.109> two

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
right now so that's going to take two

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.039 
right now so that's going to take two
days<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.919> believe<00:03:47.489> we'll<00:03:47.639> be<00:03:47.669> back<00:03:47.940> at<00:03:48.329> home<00:03:48.780> in

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
days I believe we'll be back at home in

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.229 
days I believe we'll be back at home in
two<00:03:49.230> days<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.680> it'll<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.340> perfect<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.000> when<00:03:51.150> we

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
two days so it'll be perfect for when we

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.879 
two days so it'll be perfect for when we
get<00:03:51.419> home<00:03:51.569> we<00:03:51.750> could<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:52.019> easily<00:03:52.290> collect<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
get home we could just easily collect it

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.159 
get home we could just easily collect it
but<00:03:53.730> than<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.090> guess<00:03:54.269> that's<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.810> will<00:03:55.019> I

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
but than that I guess that's it will I

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.449 
but than that I guess that's it will I
can't<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.739> internet<00:03:55.829> for<00:03:56.010> much<00:03:56.280> more
