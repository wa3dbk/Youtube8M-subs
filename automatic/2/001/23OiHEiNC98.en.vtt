00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
funny enough one of our friends got

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.750 
funny enough one of our friends got
stuck<00:02:09.640> outside<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.269> gate<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:11.760> basically

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
stuck outside of the gate and basically

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.069 
stuck outside of the gate and basically
this<00:02:12.969> random<00:02:13.269> event<00:02:13.480> started<00:02:13.840> where<00:02:13.989> we

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
this random event started where we

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.229 
this random event started where we
started<00:02:14.409> just<00:02:14.590> having<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.069> kill<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.849> bunch<00:02:16.090> of
