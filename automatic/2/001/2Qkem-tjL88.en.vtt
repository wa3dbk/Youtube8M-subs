put<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.259> back<00:01:49.380> basically<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> same<00:01:50.159> way<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
put it back basically the same way it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
put it back basically the same way it
was<00:01:50.610> before<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.030> cut<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.420> half<00:01:51.570> found<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
was before I cut it in half found this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.940 
was before I cut it in half found this
put<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> hole<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.020> use<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.830> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
put a hole in it use this as so the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
put a hole in it use this as so the
threaded<00:01:56.220> rod<00:01:56.460> comes<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.270> yeah<00:01:57.899> okay

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
threaded rod comes off of this yeah okay

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.310 
threaded rod comes off of this yeah okay
wonder<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.679> we<00:01:58.740> could<00:01:58.860> light<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.549> torch<00:02:00.320> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
wonder if we could light the torch you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.960 
wonder if we could light the torch you
just<00:02:01.560> graze<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.130> tip<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.429> that<00:02:02.549> match<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
just graze the tip of that match and it

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.130 
just graze the tip of that match and it
will<00:02:03.060> light<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.750> had<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> little

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
will light it like if you had a little

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.120 
will light it like if you had a little
gas<00:02:04.619> boom<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.580> like<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.619> make<00:02:07.619> safer

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
gas boom it would like to go make safer

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.490 
gas boom it would like to go make safer
