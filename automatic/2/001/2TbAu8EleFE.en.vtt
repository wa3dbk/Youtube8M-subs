00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.620
 and today we are in an internship 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.880
 popeye the first days that are done that are learning to take off laugh 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.159
 learn to handle the wind head on 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.839
 and then be an interim laughs 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.869
 in terms of solutions 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.029
 well there the truth when it was missing 1 2 3 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.989
 406 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.049
 I want to know more if there is a reality and guys of different levels 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.169
 besides they are flying but they still need instruction 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.060
 this day and another that 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.700
 they are going to fly another mountain higher than vitamin acid instruction that is 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.100
 there are different levels of students and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 go with your characteristic vehemently personality of the time physical state 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.449
 etcetera etcetera that make it out there 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.940
 you can not give a class complete the same time 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.040
 tmg with all lasted a course 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.850
 Well that is relative precisely because you have 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.780
 physical state there are people who believe they are of advanced age or something that has the psoe 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.810
 little overweight because of a physical problem then the psoe want to have 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600
 a little more practice time 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.730
 or percent 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.870
 more time than other young people who do not have a physical problem 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.770
 then you are more time to vote in others 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 who have psychic problems who think of something else there while 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 they practice and fill up they can not advance in their 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.670
 in his work his learning and another that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.690
 he has his fears and I continue the art 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.030
 good good a little back king and they need to resolve their their conflict by 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 something is getting ahead in the flight is a sexy so much there is more time than others 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.910
 has its head fully open to move forward 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.910
 and that we have him the meteorology that is wanted over there 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.870
 although strong subtraction or cd 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.940
 turn for the side that we should not have that we have to have headwind if 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.690
 well in merida after the montonera we can not do anything then 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.730
 music strong earthquake he deadline promised the process to follow with the practices and 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.520
 third 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.100
 can not do anything for example there wind very strong if there is a little bit of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.049
 strong wind in height and above the stopped pilots came flying or I did not 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.049
 they have gone because they already know 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 this is the riot there is no possibility of flying in that if they do not come 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.769
 and he used his time to other things 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.769
 but the boys are in stage a of this one 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.190
 where you can practice the e-elt inflating here below and less 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.039
 wind then if we do this job 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.669
 or how long it lasts from the beginning until the end of the course 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.580
 that's why magical as we talked about recent relative to the real cost ice ax or physical 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.630
 psychic the weather and the time available each because there are people who 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.629
 works during the week and 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.330
 and good and only take Saturday or Sunday today and another one out there that by 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.310
 unanimously to tell you to work and in winter the days are short and good 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.150
 stoner amount of problems for people to come though it is very close to 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.129
 Cordova 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 then a pulse with him is normal 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.569
 of initiation that cómic complete with vehicles of hill the bell 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.219
 they get to do it out there between ee 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.579
 two months 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.959
 approximately for that red path of jujuy but courses at 2300 pesos 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.709
 as I say do not include those above 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.889
 and with all the material they need to work you can give yourself 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:24.639
 the veracity of the helmet a radio to fly that the consumption did not desistió the 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.829
 people who want to keep flying or you can rent the Paraguayan team 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.540
 not whole rent because then live an area with many wine a lot 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.449
 stone 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.169
 percent 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.489
 with a lot of people it has a lot of stone and they break and 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.209
 you can always borrow a team to rent it because then it will reach 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.450
 break it and dignity the team comes down to you then 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.839
 normally people have their own team with 90 on January 1 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.019
 percent 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.759
 I had but not what it is 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:00.829
 gm I have a hard time assuming it peron I'm always waiting for a hip student 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.529
 with this method is the correct and welcome its prosperous 100 years of 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:08.119
 the image is a person with you 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:11.119
 These points 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.799
