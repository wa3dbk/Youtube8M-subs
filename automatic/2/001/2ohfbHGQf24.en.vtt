00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
everything we see an actual monkey here
so<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> looks<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:49.979> Goku<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.729> originally

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so it looks like Goku was originally

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.569 
so it looks like Goku was originally
supposed<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> monkey<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
supposed to be a monkey as he was in the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
supposed to be a monkey as he was in the
journey<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> west'<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.720> also<00:01:54.869> have

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
journey to the west' we also have

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
journey to the west' we also have
drawings<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.829> two<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.520> main

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
drawings of two of the other main

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.060 
drawings of two of the other main
characters<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.689> Bulma<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> along

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
characters which are Bulma and along

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.270 
characters which are Bulma and along
while<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.329> Dragon<00:02:00.750> Ball<00:02:00.780> story<00:02:01.229> Bulma<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
while in the Dragon Ball story Bulma I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.709 
while in the Dragon Ball story Bulma I
would<00:02:02.520> consider<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.939> main<00:02:03.180> character<00:02:03.390> but

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
would consider a main character but

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.690 
would consider a main character but
along<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> side<00:02:04.890> character<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
along is more of a side character but in

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.540 
along is more of a side character but in
the<00:02:06.149> original<00:02:06.750> concept<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> story<00:02:07.890> they

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the original concept for the story they

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.309 
the original concept for the story they
were<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:08.970> important<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.899> looked<00:02:10.140> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
were more important and they looked a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.430 
were more important and they looked a
lot<00:02:10.560> different<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.640> actually<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.540> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
cute little lovable pig which can

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.250 
cute little lovable pig which can
shape-shift<00:02:23.490> he's<00:02:24.210> actually<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.900> big

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
shape-shift he's actually this big

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.370 
shape-shift he's actually this big
muscular<00:02:26.160> looking<00:02:26.820> pig<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
muscular looking pig we see that the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.650 
muscular looking pig we see that the
characters<00:02:28.800> have<00:02:29.010> major<00:02:29.310> differences<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
characters have major differences to the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
characters have major differences to the
way<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:31.080> look<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.740> imagine<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
way they look and I can imagine that the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.920 
way they look and I can imagine that the
story<00:02:32.850> would<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.120> been<00:02:33.360> different<00:02:33.570> as<00:02:33.780> well

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
story would have been different as well

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.720 
story would have been different as well
because<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> characters<00:02:35.250> aren't<00:02:35.580> that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
because if the characters aren't that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.370 
because if the characters aren't that
close<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> way<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.020> would<00:02:37.140> imagine

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
close to the way that you would imagine

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
close to the way that you would imagine
them<00:02:37.740> being<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> journey<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> west'

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
them being in the journey to the west'

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.180 
them being in the journey to the west'
and<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> can<00:02:39.780> imagine<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.500> story<00:02:40.830> would

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
and I can imagine that the story would

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.310 
and I can imagine that the story would
be<00:02:41.220> somewhat<00:02:41.760> similar<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.330> well<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.290> be

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
be somewhat similar as well and to be

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.200 
be somewhat similar as well and to be
honest<00:02:43.740> with<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.280> glad<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.940> he<00:02:45.060> made

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
honest with you I'm glad that he made

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.150 
honest with you I'm glad that he made
the<00:02:45.360> changes<00:02:45.780> because<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.500> characters<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the changes because the characters the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.070 
the changes because the characters the
way<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> armed<00:02:47.820> dragon<00:02:48.360> ball<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.780> just

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
way that the armed dragon ball are just

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.990 
way that the armed dragon ball are just
lovable<00:02:49.440> they're<00:02:49.980> great<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.490> watch<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.910> they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
lovable they're great to watch and they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.180 
lovable they're great to watch and they
grow<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.600> quickly<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.680> think<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.100> if

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
grow on you quickly and I think that if

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
grow on you quickly and I think that if
Akira<00:02:53.520> Toriyama<00:02:53.880> stuck<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.510> his<00:02:54.660> original

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
Akira Toriyama stuck to his original

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.440 
Akira Toriyama stuck to his original
concept<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:55.740> Dragon<00:02:56.310> Ball<00:02:56.460> it<00:02:56.940> wouldn't

concept for Dragon Ball it wouldn't

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
concept for Dragon Ball it wouldn't
really<00:02:57.600> be<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:57.930> popular<00:02:58.380> because<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.860> isn't<00:02:59.010> an

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
really be as popular because it isn't an

The Journey to the West it would be more

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.320
