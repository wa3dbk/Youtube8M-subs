this assault shield is going to give us
two<00:03:16.639> main<00:03:16.879> benefits<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.659> we<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.840> use<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.109> in

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:18.229 
two main benefits and we can use it in

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.089 
two main benefits and we can use it in
two<00:03:18.349> main<00:03:18.799> ways

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
two main ways

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.369 
two main ways
first<00:03:19.940> up<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.359> either<00:03:20.419> plant<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.959> down<00:03:21.109> and

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
first up we can either plant it down and

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.629 
first up we can either plant it down and
use<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.739> possible<00:03:22.220> cover

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
use it as possible cover

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.520 
use it as possible cover
it's<00:03:23.180> got<00:03:23.329> that<00:03:23.449> useful<00:03:23.629> little<00:03:24.049> window<00:03:24.349> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's got that useful little window that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.869 
it's got that useful little window that
you<00:03:24.590> can<00:03:24.620> see<00:03:24.739> through<00:03:25.069> while<00:03:25.310> being<00:03:25.519> crouched

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
you can see through while being crouched

then to finish off the equipment

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.580 
then to finish off the equipment
selections<00:03:50.599> we'll<00:03:50.690> go<00:03:50.810> with<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.019> lethal<00:03:51.199> and<00:03:51.530> a

then one of the main defense systems of
real-life<00:04:01.909> tanks<00:04:02.389> is<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.720> smokescreen<00:04:03.319> that

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
real-life tanks is that smokescreen that

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.349 
real-life tanks is that smokescreen that

can protect against laser targeting

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.659 
can protect against laser targeting
systems<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.379> go<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> smoke<00:04:07.010> grenade<00:04:07.400> for
