00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.190 
all your radiators the landing gear down
there<00:01:42.920> now<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.250> move<00:01:44.430> around

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
there now if I move around

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
there now if I move around
don't<00:01:46.200> hit<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> ship<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> engines

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
don't hit the ship it's got the engines

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
don't hit the ship it's got the engines
there<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.049> crouch<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> area

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
there and if we crouch this is the area

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
there and if we crouch this is the area
where<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.060> you've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> cargo<00:01:51.780> pod<00:01:52.049> it'll

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
where if you've got a cargo pod it'll

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.100 
where if you've got a cargo pod it'll
sort<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.680> slot<00:01:53.130> into<00:01:53.369> here<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.570> obviously

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
sort of slot into here but obviously

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.649 
sort of slot into here but obviously
this<00:01:55.530> doesn't<00:01:55.890> have<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> moment

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
this doesn't have one at the moment

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
this doesn't have one at the moment
though<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.200> suppose<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.740> can't<00:01:58.950> fit<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
though you suppose we can't fit one and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
though you suppose we can't fit one and
then<00:01:59.670> there's<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.329> box<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
then there's that little box there that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
then there's that little box there that
is<00:02:01.380> where<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.770> head<00:02:02.100> sits<00:02:02.579> when<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> use<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is where your head sits when you use the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.780 
is where your head sits when you use the
bed<00:02:03.540> which<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.409> basically<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> coffin<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.640> will

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
bed which is basically the coffin I will

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.359 
bed which is basically the coffin I will
show<00:02:05.939> before<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:07.200> let's<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.649> move<00:02:08.009> around

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
show before so let's just move around

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.820 
show before so let's just move around
and<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:09.420> also<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.170> background<00:02:10.560> here

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
and you can see also the background here

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
and you can see also the background here
a<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> hangar<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> does<00:02:12.090> look<00:02:12.330> rather

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
a bit of the hangar it does look rather

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.860 
a bit of the hangar it does look rather
than

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
than

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.949 
than
it's<00:02:13.769> not<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:14.099> favorite<00:02:14.730> hanger<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
it's not my favorite hanger but it is

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.259 
it's not my favorite hanger but it is
certainly<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> most<00:02:17.069> atmospheric<00:02:17.370> in

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
certainly one of the most atmospheric in

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.860 
certainly one of the most atmospheric in
my<00:02:18.450> opinion<00:02:18.830> but<00:02:19.830> moving<00:02:20.519> along<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.180> move

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
my opinion but moving along just move

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.199 
my opinion but moving along just move
past<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.280> basically<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.819> same<00:02:24.000> on

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
past here see it's basically the same on

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.430 
past here see it's basically the same on
either<00:02:24.330> side<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.640> yeah<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:28.110> rear

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
either side and yeah so that's the rear

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.979 
either side and yeah so that's the rear
bit<00:02:28.650> let's<00:02:29.069> go<00:02:29.220> inside<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.090> let's<00:02:30.360> open<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:30.870> up

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
bit let's go inside so let's open it up

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.360 
bit let's go inside so let's open it up
and<00:02:31.349> take<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:33.239> let's<00:02:33.269> get<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.680> bit<00:02:35.250> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and take a look so let's get in a bit of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.990 
and take a look so let's get in a bit of
a<00:02:35.430> teleport<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.239> that's<00:02:36.540> okay<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.610> yeah<00:02:38.610> this

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
a teleport but that's okay so yeah this

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.479 
a teleport but that's okay so yeah this
is<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.330> basic<00:02:40.110> entry<00:02:40.620> point<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.129> can<00:02:41.280> see

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
is the basic entry point you can see

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.140 
is the basic entry point you can see
there's<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.780> room<00:02:43.430> yep<00:02:44.459> camera<00:02:45.090> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
there's not a lot of room yep camera is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.630 
there's not a lot of room yep camera is
a<00:02:45.209> bit<00:02:45.239> Spacey<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:45.989> got<00:02:46.440> danger<00:02:47.040> sign<00:02:47.310> there

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
a bit Spacey there got danger sign there

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.240 
a bit Spacey there got danger sign there
that's<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> cockpit<00:02:48.590> which<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.099> see

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that's the cockpit which you can see

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.949 
that's the cockpit which you can see
it's<00:02:50.400> quite<00:02:50.610> nicely<00:02:50.970> detailed<00:02:51.360> for<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:51.870> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
it's quite nicely detailed for what it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.949 
it's quite nicely detailed for what it
is<00:02:52.110> an<00:02:52.519> ejection<00:02:53.519> seat<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:54.540> some<00:02:54.720> kind

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
is an ejection seat or some kind

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.900 
is an ejection seat or some kind
although<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.380> can't<00:02:55.739> actually<00:02:55.980> eject<00:02:56.700> from

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
although you can't actually eject from

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.809 
although you can't actually eject from
the<00:02:57.120> Aurora<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> moment<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.519> know

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the Aurora at the moment so I don't know

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.869 
the Aurora at the moment so I don't know
what<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.299> exactly<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.700> unless<00:03:02.700> that's

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
what that's exactly for unless that's

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.240 
what that's exactly for unless that's
maybe<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.150> an<00:03:03.420> oxygen<00:03:03.959> bottle<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.440> don't<00:03:04.799> know

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
maybe just an oxygen bottle I don't know

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.309 
maybe just an oxygen bottle I don't know
now<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.879> we<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.150> through<00:03:06.329> here<00:03:06.360> oh<00:03:06.629> no<00:03:06.900> you

but<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.299> okay<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> suppose<00:03:36.989> looking<00:03:37.799> in

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
but that's okay I suppose looking in

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.190 
but that's okay I suppose looking in
turning<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.760> non-existent<00:03:39.450> systems<00:03:40.049> at

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
turning on the non-existent systems at

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.190 
turning on the non-existent systems at
the<00:03:40.260> moment<00:03:40.639> now<00:03:41.639> because<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.329> haven't<00:03:42.690> put<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
the moment now because I haven't put the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.720 
the moment now because I haven't put the
helmet<00:03:43.620> on<00:03:43.650> I'm<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.130> getting<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> arena

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
helmet on I'm not getting the arena

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.909 
helmet on I'm not getting the arena
commander<00:03:44.970> stuff<00:03:45.450> popping<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.620> good

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
commander stuff popping up which is good

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.170 
commander stuff popping up which is good
because<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.370> didn't<00:03:47.549> really<00:03:47.639> want<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.030> to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
because I didn't really want that to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.720 
because I didn't really want that to
show<00:03:48.389> for<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.660> video<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.430> it's

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
show for the video but you can see it's

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.870 
show for the video but you can see it's
quite<00:03:51.090> decent<00:03:51.750> view<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.380> ship<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:53.040> bit<00:03:53.639> bit

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
quite decent view in this ship a bit bit

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.460 
quite decent view in this ship a bit bit
of<00:03:54.000> flickering<00:03:54.329> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.569> texture<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:55.169> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
of flickering on the texture there and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.610 
of flickering on the texture there and
I'm<00:03:56.099> going<00:03:56.730> through<00:03:56.940> all<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.139> looks

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
I'm going through all that that looks

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.830 
I'm going through all that that looks
painful<00:03:58.889> that<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.389> looks<00:04:00.569> painful

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
painful that really looks painful

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.420 
painful that really looks painful
actually<00:04:01.139> how<00:04:01.349> do<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.560> do<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:02.099> with<00:04:02.280> your

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
actually how do you do that with your

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.990 
actually how do you do that with your
neck<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:04.230> yeah<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.040> got<00:04:05.190> quite<00:04:05.220> good

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
neck but yeah see it's got quite good

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.349 
neck but yeah see it's got quite good
view<00:04:06.359> for<00:04:06.870> what<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.010> that's<00:04:08.819> one<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.269> my

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
view for what it is and that's one of my

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.849 
view for what it is and that's one of my
favorite<00:04:09.720> things<00:04:09.900> about<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.349> ship<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.709> it's

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
favorite things about this ship is it's

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.520 
favorite things about this ship is it's
just<00:04:10.919> so<00:04:11.130> good<00:04:11.940> with<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.540> view<00:04:12.780> inside<00:04:13.139> you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
just so good with the view inside you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.949 
just so good with the view inside you
can<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:13.940> pretty<00:04:14.940> much<00:04:15.120> everywhere<00:04:15.780> around

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
can see pretty much everywhere around

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.759 
can see pretty much everywhere around
you<00:04:16.349> so<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:18.180> basically<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.289> caught<00:04:19.470> bit

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
you so that's basically they caught bit

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.260 
you so that's basically they caught bit
and<00:04:20.090> let's<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.269> get<00:04:21.599> out<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.049> now<00:04:22.260> and

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and let's just get out of it now and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.450 
and let's just get out of it now and
go<00:04:23.539> have<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> look<00:04:23.960> one<00:04:24.710> more<00:04:24.770> time<00:04:24.889> at<00:04:25.130> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
go have a look one more time at the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.300 
go have a look one more time at the
outside<00:04:26.199> clip<00:04:27.199> Brown<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.650> chair<00:04:27.919> again

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
outside clip Brown the chair again

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.800 
outside clip Brown the chair again
that's<00:04:28.699> no<00:04:29.120> problem

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
that's no problem

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.320 
that's no problem
and<00:04:30.250> actually<00:04:31.250> what<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.550> could<00:04:31.759> do<00:04:31.940> we've<00:04:32.150> got

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
and actually what I could do we've got

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.420 
and actually what I could do we've got
some<00:04:32.569> sort<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.050> things<00:04:33.620> there<00:04:34.069> I<00:04:34.099> don't<00:04:34.310> know

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
some sort of things there I don't know

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.589 
some sort of things there I don't know
what<00:04:34.550> they<00:04:34.699> are<00:04:34.729> maybe<00:04:35.090> that's<00:04:35.270> where<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.449> put

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
what they are maybe that's where you put

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.059 
what they are maybe that's where you put
the<00:04:35.720> ammunition<00:04:36.139> for<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.349> guns<00:04:36.620> or<00:04:36.889> something

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
the ammunition for the guns or something

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.089 
the ammunition for the guns or something
I<00:04:37.460> don't<00:04:38.000> know<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.389> if<00:04:38.479> we<00:04:38.599> hit<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.410> insert

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
I don't know but if we hit the insert

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.390 
I don't know but if we hit the insert
whoops<00:04:40.669> we're<00:04:41.330> inside<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.110> ship<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:43.190> if<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
whoops we're inside the ship and if I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.339 
whoops we're inside the ship and if I
hit<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.610> again<00:04:44.060> we<00:04:44.539> can<00:04:44.690> have<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.900> look<00:04:45.169> around

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
hit it again we can have a look around

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.529 
hit it again we can have a look around
the<00:04:45.680> outside<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.520> Aurora<00:04:46.819> in<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.360> more

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
the outside of the Aurora in a bit more

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.589 
the outside of the Aurora in a bit more
detail<00:04:48.139> so<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:49.130> can<00:04:49.280> see<00:04:49.550> we've<00:04:49.880> got<00:04:50.210> the

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
detail so you can see we've got the

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.240 
detail so you can see we've got the
missiles<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.020> are<00:04:51.110> facing<00:04:51.500> backwards<00:04:52.099> at

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
missiles that are facing backwards at

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.820 
missiles that are facing backwards at
the<00:04:52.340> moment<00:04:52.699> so<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.449> is<00:04:53.930> kind<00:04:54.259> of<00:04:54.380> shooting

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
the moment so it is kind of shooting

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.710 
the moment so it is kind of shooting
itself<00:04:55.310> in<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.669> engine<00:04:56.150> there<00:04:56.330> that's

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
itself in the engine there that's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.350 
itself in the engine there that's
probably<00:04:57.169> not<00:04:57.590> advisable

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
probably not advisable

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.059 
probably not advisable
you've<00:04:59.360> got<00:04:59.509> the<00:04:59.659> overdrive<00:05:00.380> engine<00:05:00.889> there

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
you've got the overdrive engine there

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.740 
you've got the overdrive engine there
which<00:05:01.280> was<00:05:01.460> featured<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.210> commercial

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
which was featured in the commercial

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.080 
which was featured in the commercial
which<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.229> quite<00:05:03.560> nice<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.280> like<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.580> intake

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
which is quite nice I like that intake

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.960 
which is quite nice I like that intake
and<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.919> color<00:05:07.190> scheme<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.610> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
and I like the color scheme on the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.210 
and I like the color scheme on the
Aurora<00:05:08.330> Ln<00:05:08.750> as<00:05:08.930> well<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.380> kind<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.770> reminds<00:05:10.099> me

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
Aurora Ln as well it kind of reminds me

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.909 
Aurora Ln as well it kind of reminds me
of<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.550> Aussie<00:05:10.759> green<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.389> gold<00:05:11.659> so<00:05:12.560> of

of the Aussie green and gold so of

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.550 
of the Aussie green and gold so of
course<00:05:13.159> I'm<00:05:13.430> gonna<00:05:13.520> like<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:15.050> yeah

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
other than that it's pretty much a

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.279 
other than that it's pretty much a
standard<00:05:18.020> Aurora<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.970> if<00:05:19.970> you're<00:05:20.360> but<00:05:21.080> only

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
standard Aurora and if you're but only

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.409 
standard Aurora and if you're but only
interested<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:21.979> putting<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.490> basic<00:05:22.909> backing

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
interested in putting a basic backing
