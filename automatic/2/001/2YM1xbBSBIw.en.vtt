00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
it is when I strike the first note a lot

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020 
it is when I strike the first note a lot
I<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.200> big<00:03:04.500> thump<00:03:04.950> across<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.580> six<00:03:05.820> strings

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030

I do a big thump across all six strings
and<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.200> only<00:03:07.380> way<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.920> really<00:03:08.220> work<00:03:08.400> is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and the only way that can really work is

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.630 
and the only way that can really work is
if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.880> mute<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:09.540> six<00:03:10.020> strings<00:03:10.370> I'm<00:03:11.370> kind<00:03:11.550> of

if you mute all six strings I'm kind of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.630 
if you mute all six strings I'm kind of
using<00:03:11.880> both<00:03:12.000> hands<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.490> one<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.550> the

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
using both hands to do it and one of the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.040 
using both hands to do it and one of the
things<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.940> do<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> lot<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.810> guitar

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
