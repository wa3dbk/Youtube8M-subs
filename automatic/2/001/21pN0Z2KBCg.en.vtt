00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 but continuous collection 54 75 planes 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.510
 for the architect 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.330
 to carry out this mission we have to 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.700
 have first separated the mission 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.990
 cleaning the efe and after this 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.730
 mission 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.770
 franklin has to send you a message 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.140
 of text because he is looking for 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.570
 architect who has the blueprints of 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.519
 building of the fy see good view the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.220
 message from franklin that you found it and 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.669
 now let's change to franklin because 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 he is very very close to the architect that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:38.129
 architect is called paterson chip 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.699
 yes yes paterson if it's the name petterson 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.190
 peters and survive chip name good and 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.190
 we see that is Greek franklin is not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.379
 talking on the phone there is still care 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.350
 and there is the author the architect but 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:57.129
 we have to enter the work or the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.019
 building so that the architect can 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.899
 go out 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:04.210
 well here this construction manager I know that 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.610
 let's wear a helmet and it's fine so 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 we have to be leaders 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.710
 and it's the architect this mission is 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:20.120
 easy recontra forum is very easy and is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.510
 I run also good these missions are 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.030
 for the assault to the axis you remember that 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.060
 they want these types of eve and steve that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.820
 we infiltrate this building and good 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.800
 things because it's so good about everything 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.409
 Steve is involved in some things that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.909
 wants 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.649
 who wants to disappear and as a reward 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.700
 so to speak they are going to erase the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.920
 topic files as is the 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.390
 architect already moving forward we have to 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.600
 notice that there are not many people 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.179
 around that they can look at us and I 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.890
 I'm going to give a goal and a hit before 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.690
 climb that elevator 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.000
 and there it is 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 well now we have to leave the work 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.260
 as fast as possible good normally 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.020
 the architect will go up to the elevator and 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.240
 then it will go to the highest plant and 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.220
 then he will be in a room going to 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.530
 be a long way but the problem is 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.170
 when we leave, it's going to be a 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.069
 little long so you care about this 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.439
 of mission time and all that 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.810
 the mission asks you only to escape 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.260
 in the hour in 45 seconds let's see 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.780
 you have to be very quick when escaping 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.959
 If you're going upstairs to take 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.700
 a little more at least you have a 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 parachute and jump and bring the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.079
 surface faster and true there yes 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.650
 it can be but if it's just going to go 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:49.569
 walking is not going to be that simple and 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 you can also catch on the poly can 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.739
 see from the other workers and can see a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.930
 little complication 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.639
 then we better hit the guy 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.069
 before I just the elevator since I do not 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.840
 there are many people around 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.379
 well now we have to go only to the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.889
 textile factory to leave the planes and already 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.469
 finalize the details of this assault on 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.560
 that good level we are here in the 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.330
 tree factory 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.380
 so let's go make a marker 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.959
 yellow to meet Lester and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.470
 leave this this briefcase with the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.470
 whites 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.930
 and there is the east and also michael and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.930
 they arrived like you 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.010
 Light 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.010
 anfac on the hill 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.370
 and here 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.790
 or comes to me 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.890
 and software 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.090
 Show 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.489
 i 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.830
 we already have the plan almost ready by list 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.830
 to pacify 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 i 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.270
 to earn more 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.960
 the xperia lesson well and hit 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.960
 the batting 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 7 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.369
 firefighters 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:06:00.210
 4 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:03.540
 well here I'm going to choose firefighters like 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.540
 the gunmen 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.330
 good as I had already unlocked packing 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.810
 mccrory so everything is perfect 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.129
 we have max that's why I blocked it 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.969
 blocked there is another option 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:30.919
 now I'm left with gustavo motta has been 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:36.559
 a good worker a good gunman like that 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:39.790
 yes but robert link there is an absolute 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:42.780
 of those planes is fine 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.780
 we confirm 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.500
 and the mode by the fire department is pretty 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.500
 short 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.380
 9 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.850
 but I do have now 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.879
 well the big blow is still in 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.620
 wait yet because with trefoil I think 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.530
 that we have to do it 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.540
 well the mission thus concludes quite 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.580
 short true plans for architect 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.139
 we've heard in 17 seconds good up 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.850
 here that this summer in the next 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.850
 video city ​​friends
