00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.260
 now 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.969
 no matter how difficult it is for me 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.580
 reached an inexorable conclusion and 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.770
 deeply disturbing 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.930
 I think an elite of people together with 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.090
 the companies that manage have got 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.040
 control not only our energy the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.960
 food supply education and 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.820
 health but to each of the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.079
 facets of our life and they do 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.869
 controlling the world of finance 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.309
 but do not create more value but in 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.730
 they actually control the source of the money 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.260
 works of money 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.880
 manning when I followed the money 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.370
 I saw that I was crawling to the top of a 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.620
 pyramid here we are at the base of the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 pyramid with our day to day by 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.950
 on top of us is the government 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.410
 people who have been granted 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.150
 a monopoly of power and they use it to 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.730
 impose taxes and control us 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.220
 we agree or not but who the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.410
 they control them at the next level 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.750
 we find many companies 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.610
 people think that today they are 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 those that govern the world and not the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.780
 national states and they call it 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 corporatocracy to get the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.860
 global resources and control the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.750
 markets is corporatocracy should have 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.670
 access to cheap big money 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.380
 corporations get their loans to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.540
 a special interest of the great 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 banks which means that those who 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.810
 the big banks control the elite 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.540
 wealthy are the ones who actually 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.040
 they control the corporations while 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.930
 I followed the money I realized that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 almost all the ideas I had about 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.520
 of capital are not true 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.509
 It is curious the fact that we 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.180
 we pose very few questions about 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.280
 everyday things like for example when 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.979
 we go to a bank and we ask for a loan 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.020
 of let's say 50,000 dollars or 50,000 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.360
 pounds that happens actually let's see 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.700
 many people have life based 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
 in ideas that are far from the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 reality what really happens is that 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.439
 if you ask 50,000 pounds write that in 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.569
 your account is 50,000 pounds that's all 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.939
 what they do does not mint coins or 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.019
 print tickets do not resort to any 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.299
 precious metal 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.549
 simply write on a screen 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.030
 computer that your account has 50,000 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.099
 free pounds way from my man 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.690
 from that moment you start paying 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.299
 interests on a quantity of money 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.480
 that has never existed that does not exist and 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:28.000
 that will not exist it turns out that banks 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.799
 they lend about 9 times more money than 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.079
 amount that they actually keep in their 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.880
 cameras and this is possible thanks to 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.739
 loan known as a reserve 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 fractional works of the following 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.690
 way to the federal reserve or to the bank 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.010
 Central of any country is allowed 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.459
 determine the amount 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.530
 that a bank should have in its reserves 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.640
 in the usa right now it's pretty much 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.640
 10% 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.400
 so if you deposit ten thousand dollars in 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.799
 the bank the bank separates 10% ie 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.079
 two thousand dollars and then operates in the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.030
 market with the rest for example now 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.799
 comes to another person at the bank and asks for a 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.349
 loan of nine thousand dollars for 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.030
 buy a car at that time the 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.579
 bank lends nine thousand dollars of 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.740
 deposit that you had created the nine 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.960
 a thousand dollars disappear 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.240
 then the person requesting the 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.100
 loan pays the seller of the car and 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.110
 he enters the amount in another bank 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.110
 that is part of the same system 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.570
 central bank these nine thousand dollars 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.060
 they are considered a new deposit and so 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.250
 the process continues successively 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.900
 money is re-deposited and it becomes 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.000
 to lend until the initial deposit 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.480
 of ten thousand dollars becomes one hundred 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.480
 thousand dollars 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.100
 the banking system has just created 90 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.519
 thousand dollars simply by lending the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.510
 money 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.120
 apparently everything started with the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.459
 goldsmiths of the 17th century when people 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.170
 He looked to them to trade gold 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.359
 gold was too heavy to carry it from a 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.280
 site to another so people started to 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.829
 save it on cameras and traded with 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.290
 receipts those receipts were the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.909
 first bills as only a few 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.040
 they withdrew their gold at moments 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.599
 determined the owners of the cameras 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.239
 basically the new bankers 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.450
 they started creating gold receipts that in 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.549
 actually did not have then they lent 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.099
 those receipts and they applied them 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.220
 interests to the money lent to the gold that 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:25.030
 they did not really have that way our 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.490
 fractional reserve system 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.990
 in this system the bankers get 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.340
 make money from where there is nothing 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.610
 while the rest of us 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.169
 we have to work to earn them this 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.300
 has brought about a modern way of 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.250
 servitude where the mass of society 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.550
 work to pay off your debt with the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.550
 banks 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.340
 but as explained that if you I am 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.590
 I make tickets ourselves 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.540
 acknowledgment of falsification but if they do 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.760
 the banks then be an increase of 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.840
 the money supply as they have gotten 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.010
 the banks this power 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.060
 this is jekyll island where in 1910 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.950
 representatives of the rockefeller the 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.140
 rocha and the morgans and other bankers 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.000
 private gathered in secret to 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.140
 prepare the legislation that would create the 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.140
 federal Reserve 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.100
 the griffin was literally in charge of 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.569
 write a book about what happened in 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.779
 jekyll island blood 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.119
 central banks are like posters 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.860
 bankers who have partnered with 

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:28.169
 the respective governments of the countries 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.929
 where they operate and have been granted a 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.509
 monopolistic power over creation 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:35.309
 of the country's monetary supply that 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.439
 it was what the politicians offered them 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:40.139
 as a gift you could say in exchange for 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.209
 the association and in exchange offered by the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.849
 promise to the politicians 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:46.529
 create money out of nothing now that they have 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.840
 that power to do it every time 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.750
 the government needs it 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.669
 and since 2008 we have witnessed the greatest 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.669
 Fake money printing history 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.490
 the financial benefit disguises the 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.020
 costs hides who we should blame and 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.350
 it leaves us as debt slaves 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.700
 working to pay the bills 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.410
 we have a private bank that prints 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.390
 money for the treasure the 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.220
 federal reserve prints money in a 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.050
 system based on the debt that creates 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.970
 shortage but it places a group of 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.130
 privileged in a position where 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.720
 they have access to all the data on the 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.700
 economy while we 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.410
 we continue in ignorance so 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.690
 we have a small group of bankers 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.280
 who understand the data of how it works 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.870
 money in the economy and they are 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.400
 provides the ability to print 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.440
 money so that it follows 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.550
 protecting the privileged while 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.550
 that the rest we sink 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.250
 ah
