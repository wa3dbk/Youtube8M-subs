00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.410
 very important and I did not want to give it to 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.239

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.550

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.250

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.430
 global success of his entire career is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 popular singer because I like my life 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.229
 so I do the songs that are more 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.899
 great in the world but at the same time 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.320
 nobody or most people do not know 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.320

 commercially and it was a great success in 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.650
 Sweden 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.470

 because any other 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:04.110
 I would like to make your band and go out and tano and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.110
 you say my boat 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.950
 Hey, tell us a little about Real Madrid 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.200
 you are a fan of real madrid not good 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.930
 I can say that I in my family are not 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.069
 we are fans we are sick sick green 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.560
 no real madrid yes 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.439
 the disease of madrid is that something is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.159
 a real madrid for us as a 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.799
 list as a way to live in series 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:34.280
 densities is true is that for each 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.019
 Wednesday every Saturday do not expect there 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.139
 something that goes that the looking for world 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:43.840
 player that you are waiting for is the 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:47.419
 illusion of the whole year every year 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.430
 I think it's a volcano of positivism and 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.849
 of verticality talking about madrid 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.010
 sergio ramos, common friend 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.370
 He's a fan of flamenco and I think there's a 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.019
 little secret out there because finally you're not going 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.659
 to return something since madrid has 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:12.109

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.310
 I listened to it and I liked everything 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.740
 but I was watching him how this 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.620
 evolves negotiated of everything as 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.040
 personal as a singer like everything and 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.990
