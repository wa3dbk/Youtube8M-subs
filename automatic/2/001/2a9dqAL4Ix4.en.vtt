00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:16.440
 In general, this happened 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:27.289
 soldered to the walls 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.289
 the tank will hold tight 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 for better thermal conductivity well, then 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 which is important you can disassemble to collect 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.719
 radiator there to clean or something there 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 still 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:51.870
 this is all the position as it was and will remain 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 These are the liver turned out the length 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.570
 tubes weighing 50 days are also 6 millimeters 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.550
 because when it moves it becomes soft 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.550
 so vata 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.520
 often day is formed 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 slade time this doesn't happen here 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:33.270
 here it was necessary to do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.270
 cutting off the brass tube insert 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.400
 from the inside 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.640
 solder 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.119
 we do it all 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 here 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 diesel will either be here or here without 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:19.319
 the differences 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:25.440
 filing in the diesel on the winter road came out in 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.910
 the fact that in the winter she freezes it with Valdai 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:38.310
 Looking to try another 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:46.190
 decision and those separately put hands and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 even with them antifreeze did not work 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.220
 constructive feature of your such 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.220
 that are too tight all 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.780
 not had to use the old 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:03.590
 antiquated way severe frost is very 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 helps well
