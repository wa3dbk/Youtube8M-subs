00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.210
 so we have seen until now 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.930
 the peripteral temple that is more widespread 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.190
 the other types did not exist in tholos 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.789
 waxing stylus equipped only with a row of columns on the front of the antipastino that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 he had a row of columns on both short sides so much he had 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.410
 only the cell that the pronaos with two columns between the side doors that yes 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.119
 they extended from the saddle 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.289
 piazza adua periptero is very rare 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.550
 that Leonardo had telematics harassing me of the cell 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.660
 Finally, we ask for a small list of the characteristics of the temple 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.550
 Greek characteristics which relates to the way in which it de-conceives 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 and will be characterized by balance and harmony 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.320
 it will be a constant ratio of meters with each element being each stone 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.170
 the whole 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.710
 and they were tt scales full of faces lights and shadows vertical line those 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.300
 horizontal 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.580
 letter conceived as a manifestation of the gods 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 through the perfection of forms 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.670
 there is also a link between the structure of the temple and the natural environment 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.850
 surrounding 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.070
 since the connection merges it fits perfectly, you think 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.000
 through the alternation of lights and shadows of full of gloves created by the columns 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.880
 which served as a gateway between the closed walls of the armpit 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.880
 despite the temple being considered the home of videos 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.280
 and the cell houses the worship room images of the deity 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 religious ceremonies 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.970
 they were outside 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.430
 where the altar was 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 the temple was designed for a circular mission 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.850
 said the two short sides were marked by the pediment and one 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.009
 of the two it turned out however to be just the forehead because the voice tweet 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.009
 designed to be seen on all four sides 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.810
 face contributed to the peristalsis that enveloped him in the same way everything 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.500
 around weighted healthcare steps equal on all sides 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.670
 furthermore there was a full correspondence between form and function between structure 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.909
 decoration 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.930
 the architectural orders were not just decorative but will respond to one 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.939
 precise static function 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.439
 the parts of which the temple was composed were structural elements as a function 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.389
 architectural 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:28.869
 and this time it's all I wanted to talk about even my kouroi and korai but 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.999
 an infinite thing would come out so let's refer to the next hello 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:33.319
 Hello
