00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.089
 Scurvy in Konnersreuth so Sander 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.430
 First we start one 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.430
 to guess the text without Butz 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.810
 as you pull an immense Konrad Eilers 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.420
 and that while pulling in Kona is expensive spurs a bit Lindner is as in the TIZ 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.490
 been 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.249
 yes, since the wall is better so that I can present you better 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:41.360
 and as the first third beta 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.140
 that is the process God so to give the ban will take off 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.740
 to ... more 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.560
 The prohibition actually means general 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.160
 from the games 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 Kleinfeld and when you're dead 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.010
 a point number and not everything 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.050
 only names 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.710
 Plan the reason when you're dead 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 until the 3rd 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.210
 Commands Futures 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.210
 Of course you can change these 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980
 So in other colors 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 were caught 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.290
 Gore board 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.150
 shelf 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.130
 associated with such texts 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 still offers 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.140
 and secondly level as assessor is the sound image and indeed underlined clan 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 underlined Kauder 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.380
 never underlined 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.740
 Cities market 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.660
 underlined 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.040
 underlined 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.600
 say we want numbers starting from 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 the air makes the counter-ports 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.989
 for the contact BZ the contact ends also make pink 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590
 Citizens make PetSmart 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.120
 but do you want or have to talk to Porsche AG b 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.470
 and give to an early fifties as it already has nothing 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.520
 changed 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 now with him here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.549
 I want here at 2 55 percent 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 she seems to be back slowly 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:24.139
 Carrefour waiver so now have a pincus what you do not see I good 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.299
 find it 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.299
 it is not good yet 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.439
 better in between 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.599
 yes, I think it's actually pretty good 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.760
 Soros is actually pretty good and so I leave it 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.269
 Sothmann serves the tis 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 So only this is IT 2 the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.989
 and bring 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.489
 if winter is here now 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.120
 Tangier even on a parole Xaver show if my big one was 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.579
 to the Silver Flowers and Masha Ben Parr look 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.699
 and now we set the cockpit 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.519
 namely the CL supports Colombo Art 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.039
 i admit to i like 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.339
 not clear but that they topics the names of the Citizens 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.909
 okay then we'll do it 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.200
 Kollo what coloring for the victory is sometimes bad 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.109
 I think I 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.829
 so it is already better 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.509
 that looks pretty good actually Ursus stands out and you see yellow-red 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.549
 or not dead 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.549
 that he will never again give both teams 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.939
 then I had here 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:15.679
 Bulut 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.129
 pubs 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:18.499
 he was touched 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.059
 finished 0 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.309
 and at Blue got you to 355 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.210
 we have 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.539
 so that he shoots 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.539
 and now when you're dead CL 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.719
 hor 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.419
 Euro 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.719
 underlined 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:43.719
 imputed her underlined 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.219
 subliminal 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.289
 Complaining could be crawl 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:51.909
 To suffer 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.100
 finally a Joke eV now 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.960
 Skate announces that wants 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.729
 but I would like to now that the dat two Koller 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.210
 supports 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.879
 Blu 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.879
 only will 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.650
 Green 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.590
 and because literally I know 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.819
 155 goals 50 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.539
 thus could prove it for the consoles 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.539
 and thus we see he is dead 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.749
 SID a 4 0 2 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:29.319
 okay i think it's alright to change Contec 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.990
 our plan 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.930

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.469
 Prien 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.469
 and in Vietnam he's one hundred and fifty again 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.080
 and thus increasingly Scully write console 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.080
 Red here is the can to the complete name 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.839
 almost sober and are also quite okay 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.399
 I do not know why I did it now 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.659
 logically from Enke have more 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.219

 we were here in the countryside Brooks Sandbox over 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.219
 so in the milk carton people were not always many people 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.139
 Round came Vettel not 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.540
 we go best on the server Bohmann colleagues who already knew 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.089
 many people on it 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.610

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.479
 a missing one in the video though 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.479
 no matter 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.479
 looks good for too long and the map is today's years 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.669
 is that too password protected 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:41.960
 there it is 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.809
 Asimo is heard before 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.919

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:00.819
 it is not clear 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.939
 Stitch left 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:04.029
 and now 

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:05.229
 it was one 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.189
