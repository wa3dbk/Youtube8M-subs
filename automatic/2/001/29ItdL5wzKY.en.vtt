00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
In order to neutralize the enemy sabotage-reconnaissance groups and capture

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.340
the evidence of Russian military and Russian-made weapons presence in Ukraine counter sabotage actions

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.920
involving units of Special Operations forces of Ukraineand  were planned.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.900
Head of Special Operations headquarters of ATO.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.640
In Lugansk area near Schastya town, where recently Russian commandos were arrested,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.580
their sabotage-reconnaissance group have got into our ambush

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.320
Three members of their group suffered various degree of injuries,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:52.340
the rest of the group run away from the ambush place but left some specimens of different kinds of weapons.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.400
So, here you can see Ð° man-portable rocket launcher,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.940
although it is classified as a flamethrower  RPO-A "Shmel"

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:12.160
As you can see it is not used yet, so the enemy had no time to react and shut our soldiers,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
which were arresting them.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.860
From this two stripes it is visible that there is a thermobaric munitions,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.940
which can make an effective shooting on 200 meters and maximum shooting distance is 1000 meters.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.480
And I would say that it does not yield to 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.300
Also I would like to emphasize that during Ukrainian independence time we never produced

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.400
this product and you can see from the labeling here the date of manufacture,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.660
and these numbers correspond to consignment and producing factory.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:09.840
All of these weapons are left from Soviet Union times or nowadays made in Russian Federation.
