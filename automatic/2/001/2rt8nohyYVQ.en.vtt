00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 are with roberto mancini to comment 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.440
 a photocopy of many others 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.469
 even this evening we come out defeated 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.570
 despite the wasted opportunities 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.760
 occasions instead given away went to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.890
 win the genoa and it seems 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.200
 repeats the same things every time but 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.750
 unfortunately he made me a beautiful one 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.320
 game according to me we have committed 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.060
 some mistakes too 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.800
 but he had opportunities for me 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.120
 then to win clearly ourselves 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.430
 trying to win because it was that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.160
 who wanted to do to try to 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.060
 reach the sixth place and with 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280
 the aluminum we suffered at 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.290
 ninetieth this place 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 before I had three or four patients 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 unbelievable 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.670
 the team has played and this is it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.989
 unfortunately the results are never 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.929
 been in our part so we are 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.379
 on the wrong side but this changes 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:04.250
 our perspective is in mine then 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 although we are bitter about it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.539
 first and perhaps for a spectator 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.450
 neutral a spectacular first time 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.789
 that is, two teams that have played with it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 ball on ball with four foxes le 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.189
 opportunities on both sides 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.049
 goalkeeping parades 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.940
 a show for the soccer sign of 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.130
 two healthy teams playing for 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.360
 win who played at ease that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.940
 he had a beautiful game on the road 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.819
 clearly who wins then is happy who 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.149
 not even lose but we are here at 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.470
 regret unfortunately I believe the last ones 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.020
 three games we lost in the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.789
 last twelve or thirteen are genova with 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 the sampdoria today and at home with the juve 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.990
 three absurd games to lose for like 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.350
 we played these unfortunately are the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.570
 so no seasons 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 sometimes I thought it sounds like my first 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.080
 year when we played 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.440
 very well but in front of it wins some 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.590
 we eventually equalized 13 draws 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.100
 we are in a similar situation, however, to the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.550
 same time I believe and understand that maybe 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.750
 may be perhaps a supporter may 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880
 maybe not even understand why 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.050
 clearly fans and fans then 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.410
 when he loses he is not happy but so does the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.170
 team has its own logic 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.510
 very important mentality that he sees 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 run for the future so I for 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.680
 this I'm happy 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.820
 I'm sorry for the results but 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.580
 these will have to change next year 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.570
 but also because for this year to arrive 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 farm that still have to play 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.000
 now it seems impossible indeed 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.140
 look at yourself in terms of ranking from 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.090
 those around us 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.450
 yes no but in fact matches like this 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.520
 as with the juve ie useless where 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.490
 we can say we lost 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.290
 then for the rest of my part 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.260
 some mistakes we make on 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.060
 which we need to improve and work with 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.790
 team has always done what 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.100
