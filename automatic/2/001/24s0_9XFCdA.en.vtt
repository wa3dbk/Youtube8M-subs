shopping online but the thing I hate
about<00:03:09.620> shopping<00:03:10.010> online<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:10.910> always

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
about shopping online is that you always

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.640 
about shopping online is that you always
have<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.510> pay<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.690> whole<00:03:11.989> bunch<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.470> shipping

attached under the little gold stickers

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.640 
attached under the little gold stickers
like<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> corners<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> eyelashes<00:03:30.350> are

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
like the corners of the eyelashes are

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
like the corners of the eyelashes are
held<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.519> by<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.090> little<00:03:32.480> gold<00:03:32.690> stickers<00:03:33.140> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.860 
held on by the little gold stickers and
when<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:34.760> take<00:03:34.940> them<00:03:35.120> out<00:03:35.239> they<00:03:35.299> have<00:03:35.660> these

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
when you take them out they have these

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.890 
when you take them out they have these
little<00:03:35.959> plastic<00:03:37.150> things<00:03:38.150> sticking<00:03:38.600> out<00:03:38.750> of

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
little plastic things sticking out of

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.640 
little plastic things sticking out of
either<00:03:39.019> side<00:03:39.380> can<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> see<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.650> don't

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
either side can you see that I don't

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.740 
either side can you see that I don't
really<00:03:42.799> know<00:03:43.130> what<00:03:43.430> that's<00:03:43.609> about<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.180> think

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
really know what that's about I think

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.050 
really know what that's about I think
it's<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.799> plastic<00:03:46.430> things<00:03:46.850> are<00:03:47.030> just

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
it's just the plastic things are just

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.990 
it's just the plastic things are just
there<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.450> keep<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.959> lashes<00:03:48.489> under<00:03:49.489> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
there to keep the lashes under the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.840 
there to keep the lashes under the
little<00:03:50.420> gold<00:03:50.690> pieces<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.260> plastic<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.040> don't

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
little gold pieces of plastic I don't

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.449 
little gold pieces of plastic I don't
really<00:03:52.940> like<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.299> about<00:03:53.720> these<00:03:54.109> lashes

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
really like that about these lashes

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.890 
really like that about these lashes
because<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.769> trim<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.250> plastic<00:03:58.760> off

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
because you have to trim the plastic off

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.170 
because you have to trim the plastic off
so<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.890> not<00:04:01.010> really<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.310> big<00:04:01.489> deal<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.910> mean<00:04:02.090> I

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
so that's not really a big deal I mean I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.120 
so that's not really a big deal I mean I
keep<00:04:02.390> little<00:04:02.750> scissors<00:04:03.230> in<00:04:03.440> my<00:04:03.500> makeup<00:04:03.769> drawer

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
keep little scissors in my makeup drawer

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.220 
keep little scissors in my makeup drawer
anyway<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.850> just<00:04:05.000> can<00:04:05.180> turn<00:04:05.480> them<00:04:05.630> off<00:04:05.780> but

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
anyway and I just can turn them off but

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.110 
anyway and I just can turn them off but
I<00:04:06.260> don't<00:04:06.650> really<00:04:06.739> get<00:04:06.920> why<00:04:07.160> they<00:04:07.459> have<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.670> be

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
I don't really get why they have to be

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.750 
I don't really get why they have to be
on<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:09.260> lashes<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:12.130> couldn't<00:04:13.130> really<00:04:13.340> tell<00:04:13.579> you

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
on the lashes I couldn't really tell you

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.469 
on the lashes I couldn't really tell you
but<00:04:14.829> either<00:04:15.829> way<00:04:16.250> it's<00:04:16.609> not<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.820> very<00:04:17.090> big<00:04:17.120> deal

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
but either way it's not a very big deal

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.280 
but either way it's not a very big deal
i<00:04:17.690> just<00:04:17.900> turned<00:04:18.019> them<00:04:18.229> off

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
i just turned them off

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.480 
i just turned them off
good<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.190> other<00:04:20.370> thing<00:04:21.110> is<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:22.770> i<00:04:23.220> didn't

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
good the other thing is that i didn't

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.100 
good the other thing is that i didn't
know<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:24.030> these<00:04:24.180> lashes<00:04:24.390> were<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.990> be

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
know that these lashes were going to be

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.020 
know that these lashes were going to be
so<00:04:25.320> dramatic<00:04:25.860> when<00:04:26.430> i<00:04:26.460> ordered<00:04:26.700> them<00:04:27.000> i

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
so dramatic when i ordered them i

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.180 
so dramatic when i ordered them i
thought<00:04:27.360> these<00:04:27.570> looked<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.380> natural<00:04:28.890> but
