00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.080 
trihard level during the second game
definitely<00:07:03.200> drop<00:07:03.500> down<00:07:03.710> a<00:07:03.740> bit<00:07:04.070> I<00:07:04.340> think<00:07:04.970> he

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
definitely drop down a bit I think he

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.850 
definitely drop down a bit I think he
was<00:07:05.210> using<00:07:05.360> a<00:07:05.540> new<00:07:05.690> playbook<00:07:05.960> it<00:07:06.320> was<00:07:06.440> testing

was using a new playbook it was testing
out<00:07:06.919> some<00:07:07.160> place<00:07:07.490> so<00:07:08.300> we<00:07:08.419> still<00:07:08.630> were<00:07:08.780> trying<00:07:09.140> a

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
out some place so we still were trying a

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.740 
out some place so we still were trying a
little<00:07:09.470> bit<00:07:09.620> but<00:07:09.800> at<00:07:09.919> the<00:07:10.040> same<00:07:10.250> time

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
little bit but at the same time

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.460 
little bit but at the same time
definitely<00:07:11.750> not<00:07:11.870> going<00:07:11.960> to<00:07:12.050> be<00:07:12.140> the<00:07:12.229> first

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470
