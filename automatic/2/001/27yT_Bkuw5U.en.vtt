00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 like you 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 how are you and one are welcome 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.560
 here to this and boxing in this a boxing 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.100
 it's a bit special because it can be the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.380
 beginning 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.220
 Well, a series of important things here 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.300
 in the channel obviously I did not buy it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.980
 because as the intention is not something that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.900
 special and probably good because 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 the fact 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.980
 sponsorships but good for the moment 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.840
 I'm going to do the unboxing of this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 they gave me I will not say 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.880
 so how was it delivered to me and so on 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.410
 but then so here they are and already more 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.210
 forward the good thing will materialize 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 Well, I'll start giving the details 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.220
 ok about this is this is as good 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.310
 a source of power person coolermaster 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.620
 of 525 watts extreme 2 and the truth that 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.800
 it's not very expensive in fact in the can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.230
 acquire for 700 pesos is this source 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 of power then good he mentioned them is 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.700
 sponsored this then well so 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 let's do the little boxing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.899
 do it over here and I'll also do 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.969
 a video where I'm changing it for the 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.969
 previous power account he had then 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.600
 It weighs a lot and all that is what 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.060
 indicates something good the truth is that it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 indicates that the source is of good quality 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.030
 if it weighs then now that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 quite 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.210
 have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 does not have anything like that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.150
 let's open it 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 here are some things is 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.850
 Well, what is being the leaf is not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.190
 a manual is a manual with what they come 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.650
 being now, yes, some 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.360
 details of the other sources are not 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.620
 catch up to see I do not think good really not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.120
 It's very important 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.090
 it only tells us what's going on with the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.610
 sources how much how much power does he have in 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.740
 12 12 volt lines what good is 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 the most important thing in fact that can 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 have here is this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.730
 account and good it kills us that the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.280
 installation and so on so we can 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.430
 put it and blah blah blah show us 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.590
 some connectors and others already know 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.909
 little things here that good then once 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.579
 more or less the birds to this no longer has 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.870
 importance and good let's take the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.680
 source as I tell you weigh more 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.049
 you started tantito here is the source 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.659
 the cable is the cable that goes from the source 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.659
 to the current the box 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.810
 to uncover what has been going on is the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.760
 cable that brings from the 24 pins that goes to 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.340
 the fashion is like that reinforced good 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 is reinforcement is like that isolated is 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.840
 as isolated, that is, no, no, you can not 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.190
 move along with the other cables this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.640
 difference then the other sources 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.450
 that come apart from all this that 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.150
 they come like this 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.150
 the cables in this case isolated 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.319
 and good 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.710
 to see here I am 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.420
 this is an uncle 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:31.560
 this from here 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:35.250
 and seeing this we are going to start to separate 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.250
 the cables and them 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.260
 here is the first one is going to show you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.700
 which is the cable that is insulated from 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.519
 is the 20 on the 24 20 4 from the 20 more 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.519
 4 this is strung here 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.170
 if you are in certain here 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.400
 over here it goes by is the one of 20 4 what good 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.100
 goes directly to what has been the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.050
 mother 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.300
 now this side 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.850
 now these two 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.420
 that come here how good this is 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.420
 connect 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.400
 is for what is a good idea but this 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.979
 it also connects to the mother because it is 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.530
 to control the voltage the voltage of the 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.900
 processor that are 8 pins that in fact 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.490
 it is indicated and this 6 does not stop 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.940
 that is maybe they are for two styles of 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.120
 woman but good these who are from and who 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.449
 are that are 8 is to control the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.630
 processor voltage ok and good we go 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:42.030
 to see here that we have a 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.030
 chingo not to get into a shit 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.580
 are two are three measures are only two 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:57.099
 they are two connectors between assholes and 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.599
 others are 234 are five sata connectors 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.070
 for hard drives for the drives 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.160
 of dvd 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.990
 and now yes that among other things that 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.410
 Well, it's for those who like it 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.810
 put this hard drives to sack with your 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.980
 computer and good we have here what 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.050
 current inputs are coming 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.740
 I'm not sure what these are called in 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.300
 this but good has account with 33 if 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.940
 I'm not wrong and I do not see all the rest 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.770
 thing that is here if there are three has 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.720
 three this said I do not understand why it brings 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.660
 so many tickets it deals with nothing else taxis 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.780
 of current but good then now 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.870
 what is this the source as it injured 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.210
 it's quite heavy and it's bringing a 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.790
 120 millimeter fan or 12 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.180
 centimeters as you want to see you 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.460
 and it does not come certified to certify or 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.840
 it is not of little bit voltage starting 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.060
 of the 600's are the ones that come 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.410
 certified but good so 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.600
 I hope you liked this one 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.430
 boxing as I tell you I'm going to make a 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.860
 video also now we are going to 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.720
 record as a change in the source for 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.910
 see what's up with this new 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.790
 source of power and good well so without 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.790
 plus 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.790
 ibai
