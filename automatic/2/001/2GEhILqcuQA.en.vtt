00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
probably going to be our first scoring

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
probably going to be our first scoring
option<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.710> expect<00:01:10.710> him<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.890> return<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
option and I expect him to return to the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.630 
option and I expect him to return to the
2010<00:01:12.180> guy<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.350> Toronto<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.280> don't

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
2010 guy he was back in Toronto I don't

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
2010 guy he was back in Toronto I don't
think<00:01:14.850> he's<00:01:15.000> lost<00:01:15.270> any<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.590> anything

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
think he's lost any of that if anything

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.800 
think he's lost any of that if anything
I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.100> he's<00:01:17.520> added<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> ability<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I think he's added the ability to be a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
I think he's added the ability to be a
stretch<00:01:19.140> forward<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.740> game<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.250> think

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
stretch forward to this game I think

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.830 
stretch forward to this game I think
it's<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> big<00:01:21.240> year<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.479> botched
