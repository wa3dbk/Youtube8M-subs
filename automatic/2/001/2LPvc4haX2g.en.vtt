00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello everyone today I decided to take off for 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.080
 you video that so many 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.550
 interested and not pay attention to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 my voice is mine 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.700
 stuffy nose and this video is about losing weight and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.699
 I have to go very fast because I like 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.439
 usually do not have time and so start with 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 the fact that I excluded from my diet 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.100
 next we start with the fact that I lost weight on 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.420
 five kilograms somewhere for two with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.210
 half a month and I ruled out pasta 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 bread and of course even earlier meat and fish 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 so what else sweets and sweets in general 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.940
 it's all clear sugar practically 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.399
 ruled out but sometimes ate cereals and minutes 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.039
 where there is a lot of sugar then I noticed 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.530
 when I just poured my soul into a colander 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.399
 opens 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 I spoke for porridge all the sugar fell 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 down the sink and I moaned and ate 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.129
 so now the question is what did I eat most often 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.549
 I loved fruit porridge in the morning 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.299
 start having a couple 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 September weighed 50 kilos with growth 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.990
 152 153 a month ago I weighed 44 and now 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 after easter i'm already 46 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.610
 and in the evenings almost forty nine 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.549
 kills me and sometimes i tried to 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.070
 nobody likes that word vegan 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.710
 diets do yourself well that is how I 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.829
 trying to make vegan week 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.890
 then I do not eat any 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.690
 animal products and i read very 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 many videos watched over the fact that 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.479
 milk is very high in calories there are many 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.460
 fat and all these dairy products in general 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.000
 that is, there is even a fat free but it 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.800
 still not tone and so i start 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 exclude milk and so sunday i 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.619
 I decided to sit on a two-week such 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.350
 diet experiment vegan and already the second 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.270
 the day is now Tuesday and everything is fine by the way 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.610
 I noticed better and better each time 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 it is better to move away from dairy 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.500
 food to my diet, I have added 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.690
 sport from October I do every day 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 charging at all without exception even if 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 no place i still do care where 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.920
 if I don't have space on the floor 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.190
 and doing on the bed doing exercises and not 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.140
 I want to make a video you come on charging about 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.120
 sport and all that so we too 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.680
 separate video and about what can 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.970
 make ready for new schools 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.390
 there will be a separate video too 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.360
 but in general I did exercises every morning 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.269
 pretty simple and doing it now 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.400
 and in the evenings sometimes 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.220
 masters sometimes in the evenings after school I 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.810
 was busy with the bag but I'm too lazy and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 to do it every day so 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.760
 maybe I used to do it twice 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.519
 a week three times a week and now i'm 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.430
 this very long time did not maybe a month 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.620
 on and it's terrible but i like to find 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.140
 different channel on youtube associated with sports 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.630
 and I'm doing this for all the videos. 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.540
 time I learned for myself what if you 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.360
 straighten then throw off two kilos and 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.470
 it is a fact but more often I forget 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.930
 consumed from me is always so this is mine 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.890
 habitual position the most traditional 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.630
 usually and so if you appear then 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.280
 to show revenue between your legs 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.360
 between the thighs and in general, all the while go 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.549
 further narrow cool of course it is clear that 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.890
 does not necessarily exclude sugar completely 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.340
 and sweets and sweets and rolls and stuff 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.459
 other 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.640
 if you like something then let's say 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.960
 a week small 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.390
 small amount it can be yourself 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.340
 allow it ok and more with 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.440
 Recently, I stopped getting up on 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.319
 scales and I think it's stupid because 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.850
 noticed that my weight here as it was in 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.130
 44 kilograms how 47 kilograms 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.740
 it does not affect the change in my body and 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.590
 Well, of course it is, but if you look 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.140
 then this one did it just not 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.480
 to me it does not matter how much I'll be the whole of it 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.840
 then how will i cook so you need 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.489
 rely on your reflection in the mirror and 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.170
 maybe the first thing I had to do 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.760
 mention it water 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.650
 these more water I read somewhere that if 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.290
 every day drink plenty of water somewhere 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.360
 one and a half liters and lay in 30 grams on 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.160
 a kilo of your weight that is i need 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.350
 This one confusing liters of water burns 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.090
 these one and a half liters to burn 70 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.430
 extra calories in general I 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.710
 I guess you did not open America just 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.720
 all that the rest of the deal do and I and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.590
 so I lost weight 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.810
 but you already typed as usual and in general 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.390
 all I did was rule out the sweet 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.540
 pasta bread baking all that 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.229
 very harmful fried by the way, too, sawdust 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.030
 more water involved in sports less 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.040
 skipped fizruk here it is also very 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.620
 important and 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.390
 and everything seems to be all and just write me 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.830
