00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.970
 and then lads us back to the area 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.000
 I just showered on the face and cleared it. 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.040
 this week was corrected a lot of rain 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 thank god those people are crazy 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.509
 Do you need rain then end of? 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.880
 A week that takes a shower on the doll. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 now I'll make a quick video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 vandeci sakineh exhaust that is the pro 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.880
 tork shift 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
 it is not a release already has a quota 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 that is in the market but I think in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 fair 150 posts cheated but I think 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 I just saw it on my own on youtube I guess 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 which it has not yet so let's go there because 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.110
 We 're going to talk exhaust talk. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 first positive point of a point 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.820
 positive is the following I felt that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 it gives more torque on the bike itself is dead 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 picking up fastest speed on 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 sign I have not seen yet because I have not had 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 opportunity to take a legal challenge but 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.820
 so at low speed're 10 rise 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.640
 faster bike spin 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 another good part is that it will lead to what are 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 General Paulo I paid the full amount 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 lack of good head size what is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.619
 To enjoy is the size you like in the car. 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.240
 I think it's cool because it's short. I wanted to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.520
 end here under the tip but 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.409
 I did not find beauty 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 detail it is red to cool to 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.670
 Damn I liked it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.909
 the defects is that way right 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.799
 it's because of the chrome pro tork the serve 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.290
 not her that makes me want and 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.960
 that this detail here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.960
 this curve in my opinion is the worst is the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.390
 that the defect he has because if you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 to waver in one leg 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 sure to wear shorts to take a spin 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 motorcycle passes the weekend ends 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.579
 burning the skin if it waver that is a 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.479
 leg and top senac hairdresser 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.960
 I think they had to have done 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 Fine, it's not the pipe until you get here. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.759
 the ones that they do here are like 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.649
 cool no 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.060
 otherwise, this has more race 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 here is a rivet because the central one for 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.580
 make one out of laser beauty equip 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.580
 I bought for rifle 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.260
 In the workshop, I tried not to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.180
 when I went to see what happens to you 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.400
 Wanna teach you to participate again? 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.350
 repeating a chapter 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.540
 according to the governor who sold me the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 farm was not sporty as a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.940
 weak like v3 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.250
 it only has dampers and just try 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.350
 Damn I do not know I did not see I did not have 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.210
 opportunity to have greeted and here 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.470
 will also greet you should not have 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.770
 even if you can not put the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.010
 Individual it only if you will have the machine 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.300
 to cut it off, there's no way 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.470
 Open 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.810
 I also do not know if the proposal you made 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.940
 This ends up with glass wool , I do not know 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.470
 second seller do not have big spin 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.190
 so it gets older in its function 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.830
 but the mistake is going to make a call to you 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.750
 wrong again that it is the following as 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.910
 God the noise and I 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.580
 he has the first jet damper stays 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.650
 More or less here. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.410
 I broke damper was too much 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.570
 always looking for the bike is very original 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.709
 it's very similar to the noise 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.019
 his original is very similar to the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.090
 original exhaust noise 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.090
 now not now a little stronger 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.019
 I got a little stronger but the noise 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.480
 original it even resembles what 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.510
 you had tub with cb 300 exhaust 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.269
 remembers the noise of cars at 300 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.359
 does not become sporty in the installer 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.159
 it is as if it originates a little more open 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.840
 the power gain actually exists 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.370
 scientist mochi co 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.370
 It's going up faster. 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.060
 the cost-effective cool little mec like me 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.609
 I said 70 is good size 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.579
 escape for those who do not like 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.139
 noise but it is the right route to 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.659
 exhaust system with a 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.500
 noise a little louder than the 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.299
 original 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.220
 now if you want noise do not recommend 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:27.090
 this escape does not recommend the odh boot 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:33.599
 the ss or exhaust aluminum and also gives 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.729
 to make a lot of noise is 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.690
 still shining in yellow 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.070
 Only the tip of the bottom of the sport is fine. 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.419
 I've been escaping from this galley and 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.159
 It 's the same thing to get out of it. 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.930
 here it comes with ischemia of 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:53.430
 right clamp you put like 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.750
 original and intense clamp that goes 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.220
 take it here too under your 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.930
 screw 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.960
 so I put it here from the inside 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.720
 with one of the original costumes of the same 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.520
 so this account gets very stuffy 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.159
 then where is the problem and generates touched to 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.300
 you there you can that in matters of 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.130
 money was already 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.960
 this boy, that's when I 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.070
 had passed you go on to everyone 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.070
 and we went
