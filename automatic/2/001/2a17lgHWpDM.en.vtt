silicone hand cast around the beer can
which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> nice<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.439> didn't

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
which is nice because then we didn't

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
which is nice because then we didn't
have<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> worry<00:01:49.979> about<00:01:50.040> posing<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.700> fingers

can<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.920> painted<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> method

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
can and I painted it using the method

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
can and I painted it using the method
shown<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> silicone<00:01:58.649> hand<00:01:58.950> video<00:01:59.329> just

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
shown in the silicone hand video just

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.389 
shown in the silicone hand video just
using<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.750> bit<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.140> red<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.189> little

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
using a little bit of red and a little

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.700 
using a little bit of red and a little
bit<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> brown<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.329> blues<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:04.170> veining

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
bit of brown it's a blues for veining

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.679 
bit of brown it's a blues for veining
and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.520> course<00:02:05.549> some<00:02:05.880> blood<00:02:06.149> rat<00:02:06.420> around

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and then of course some blood rat around

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.979 
and then of course some blood rat around
the<00:02:06.869> stump<00:02:07.170> area<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:09.119> place<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the stump area now we place this on a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
the stump area now we place this on a
table<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.400> director<00:02:11.700> wanted<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
table and the director wanted to see a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.640 
table and the director wanted to see a
little<00:02:12.330> bit<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.540> movement<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.080> what<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> did<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
little bit of movement so what I did is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.000 
little bit of movement so what I did is
I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
I

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.830 
I
this<00:02:14.280> hand<00:02:14.519> up<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.849> we<00:02:14.909> used<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.269> needle<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
this hand up and we used a needle and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.170 
this hand up and we used a needle and
some<00:02:16.230> black<00:02:16.560> thread<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.370> activate<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.000> hand

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
some black thread to activate the hand

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.819 
some black thread to activate the hand
to<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.810> could<00:02:18.989> pull<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.379> needle<00:02:19.680> out

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
to make it we could pull the needle out

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.610 
to make it we could pull the needle out
from<00:02:20.730> beneath<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.180> table<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.319> would<00:02:22.470> make

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
from beneath the table and it would make

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.170 
from beneath the table and it would make
the<00:02:22.769> hand<00:02:22.980> flip<00:02:23.310> over<00:02:23.599> right<00:02:24.599> on<00:02:24.780> cue

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the hand flip over right on cue

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.830 
the hand flip over right on cue
so<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.629> our<00:02:27.870> hand<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.640> course<00:02:29.909> here's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so there's our hand and of course here's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
so there's our hand and of course here's
the<00:02:31.019> guy<00:02:31.349> that's<00:02:32.159> missing<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.909> we<00:02:33.659> did<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the guy that's missing it and we did a

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110 
the guy that's missing it and we did a
jelton<00:02:34.769> build<00:02:35.099> up<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.430> his<00:02:35.549> throat<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.970> give

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.000 
better shot of that cut throat here in
good<00:02:41.730> lighting<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.930> did<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.530> cut<00:02:43.739> throat

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
good lighting we did that cut throat

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.979 
good lighting we did that cut throat
with<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> buildup<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.909> gel<00:02:45.209> tin<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.750> I'll<00:02:45.840> do

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
with a buildup of gel tin and I'll do

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.410 
with a buildup of gel tin and I'll do
another<00:02:46.379> video<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:46.950> later<00:02:47.310> on

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
another video on that later on

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.000 
another video on that later on
illustrating<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.450> technique<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.890> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
illustrating that technique but this is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.330 
illustrating that technique but this is
basically<00:02:50.400> flesh<00:02:50.879> colored<00:02:51.329> gel<00:02:51.659> tin

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
basically flesh colored gel tin

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.819 
basically flesh colored gel tin
thickened<00:02:53.340> with<00:02:53.549> plat<00:02:54.090> fix<00:02:54.450> built<00:02:55.349> up<00:02:55.590> like

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
thickened with plat fix built up like

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.729 
thickened with plat fix built up like
derma<00:02:56.159> wax<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.940> create<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.420> realistic<00:02:57.870> cut

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
derma wax to create a realistic cut

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.500 
derma wax to create a realistic cut
throat<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:02.129> you<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.970> silicone

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
throat so there you have it the silicone

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.500 
throat so there you have it the silicone
hand<00:03:03.900> process<00:03:04.530> applied<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> real<00:03:06.180> world

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
hand process applied in the real world

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.410 
hand process applied in the real world
and<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.290> course<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:07.829> extra<00:03:08.340> gore<00:03:08.879> goodness

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and of course some extra gore goodness

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.170 
and of course some extra gore goodness
to<00:03:09.690> go<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.989> it
