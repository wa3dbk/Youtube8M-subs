00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 that's basically what's done in nutrition from 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:17.310
 computer itself is simple 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 this is wellton this is the side table there is this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.510
 Villa specifications need wear yellow 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.210
 one time that's 15 amps 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 350 us in the block 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.520
 bridge and the black green wire to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.579
 included well and actually with black and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 yellow which is 12 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.379
 again remove power to our saw 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.360
 soft copper wire is strong 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.960
 such is the way 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 here is a piece of armature bent it like 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.899
 the spring works two pieces here 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:09.979
 plastic sill over here 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:11.659
 inserted copper sleeves for electrics 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.030
 crimping wires 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.450
 Here is a micro Kalich under this include so 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 like this 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.750
 and there is still such a okay here it is 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.330
 it is long by ten meters 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.600
 basically a millimeter nichrome block 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.909
 power it pulls but slower 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 all this goes all would be possible 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.090
 corks remove thinner here for short 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 its period is quite enough 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 how it works so here we did 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 such carnations 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:51.149
 it is convenient to stick the profile here 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.960
 fastened by these studs here is new 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.960
 now turn on 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.370
 button 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.950
 in got we catch a crocodile you can 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 it's all of course improve 10,000 times here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:20.400
 so here it all went what put 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.950
 button make the knob more comfortable but it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.250
 need to do it need time needed 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.690
 fast and she basically works fine 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.690
 so on profile cuts 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.790
 all cut off Klitschko cordoned off even now 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.010
 you can see how it smokes that is it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.860
 millimeter nichrome wire and and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.740
 warms up so she starts 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 blush cut quickly rez turns here 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:07.630
 so that's all neatly fast no 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.630
 hand saw is inappropriate here 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.630
 thank
