its<00:01:43.750> own<00:01:43.840> thing<00:01:44.470> they're<00:01:44.710> really<00:01:44.920> focusing<00:01:45.430> on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
its own thing they're really focusing on

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.910 
its own thing they're really focusing on
make<00:01:46.060> a<00:01:46.210> major<00:01:46.600> part<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.110> game<00:01:47.290> it's

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
make a major part of the game it's

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.440 
make a major part of the game it's
pretty<00:01:48.310> much<00:01:48.490> just<00:01:48.549> looked<00:01:48.850> like<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.119> took<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
pretty much just looked like it took the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.630 
pretty much just looked like it took the
black<00:01:49.659> ops<00:01:49.869> 1<00:01:49.960> menu<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.710> modified<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.430> both

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
black ops 1 menu and modified it so both

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.730 
black ops 1 menu and modified it so both
those<00:01:51.820> are<00:01:52.000> probably<00:01:52.180> taking<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.930> one<00:01:53.200> it's

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
those are probably taking this one it's

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.370 
those are probably taking this one it's
pretty<00:01:54.040> cool<00:01:54.450> there's<00:01:55.450> not<00:01:55.600> much<00:01:55.960> here

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
pretty cool there's not much here

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.109 
pretty cool there's not much here
besides<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.040> got<00:01:57.159> la<00:01:57.550> burning<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
besides you got la burning in the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.030 
besides you got la burning in the
background<00:01:58.509> I<00:01:58.570> think<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:58.930> la<00:01:59.229> that's<00:01:59.530> the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
background I think that's la that's the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.440 
background I think that's la that's the
main<00:02:00.220> setting<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.759> game<00:02:00.909> i'm<00:02:01.149> not<00:02:01.270> sure

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
main setting in the game i'm not sure

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.210 
main setting in the game i'm not sure
that<00:02:01.479> quite<00:02:01.899> niche<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.860> trailer

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
that quite niche so this is the trailer

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
now what does kind of get me that this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.690 
now what does kind of get me that this
could<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.260> real<00:02:14.530> if<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.830> look<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> map<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
could be real if you look on the map and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.759 
could be real if you look on the map and
then<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.910> look<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.269> top<00:02:16.570> right<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.560> see

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
then you look in the top right you see

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.070 
then you look in the top right you see
the<00:02:17.920> plane<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> top<00:02:19.810> right<00:02:20.050> of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
the plane right and in the top right of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.600 
the plane right and in the top right of
the<00:02:20.200> map<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.800> what<00:02:21.100> looks<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.400> an

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the map you see what looks like an

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180 
the map you see what looks like an
ac-130<00:02:22.239> briefer<00:02:22.780> type<00:02:23.050> thing<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:24.070> all

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
ac-130 briefer type thing you see all

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.000 
ac-130 briefer type thing you see all
this<00:02:24.370> teammates<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.209> map<00:02:25.600> as<00:02:25.810> well<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.800> in

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
this teammates on the map as well but in

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.340 
this teammates on the map as well but in
this<00:02:27.130> one<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.610> timer<00:02:27.940> isn't<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.750> top<00:02:28.989> left

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
this one the timer isn't in the top left

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.320 
this one the timer isn't in the top left
it's<00:02:29.769> found<00:02:30.250> where<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.670> should<00:02:30.910> be<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.209> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's found where it should be in the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240 
it's found where it should be in the
bottom<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.590> one's<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.950> little<00:02:33.040> more

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
bottom so this one's a little more

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.190 
bottom so this one's a little more
plausible<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.910> me<00:02:33.940> looks<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:34.840> bit<00:02:35.050> more

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
plausible to me looks a little bit more

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.559 
plausible to me looks a little bit more
real<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.760> one<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:36.970> gets<00:02:37.150> me<00:02:37.360> right

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
real this is the one that gets me right

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.140 
real this is the one that gets me right
here<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.410> zombie<00:02:38.769> picture<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.730> looks

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
here the zombie picture this just looks

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.470 
here the zombie picture this just looks
so<00:02:40.540> well<00:02:40.900> done<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.580> if<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.790> real<00:02:43.239> which

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
so well done and if this is real which

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.860 
so well done and if this is real which
I'm<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> go<00:02:43.989> on<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:45.780> there's<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
I'm going to go on that it is there's a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.300 
I'm going to go on that it is there's a
couple<00:02:47.019> details<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.680> see<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.040> this<00:02:48.250> is

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
couple details we see here this is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.140 
couple details we see here this is
probably<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.060> first<00:02:49.150> map<00:02:49.630> obviously<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:51.150> you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
probably the first map obviously and you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.000 
probably the first map obviously and you
see<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.989> thing<00:02:53.019> on<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.410> left<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.890> like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
see that thing on the left is that like

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.100 
see that thing on the left is that like
a<00:02:54.040> little<00:02:54.310> list<00:02:54.579> like<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.880> little<00:02:54.970> elevator<00:02:55.540> you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
a little list like a little elevator you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.520 
a little list like a little elevator you
see<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.380> got<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.650> power<00:02:56.890> switch<00:02:57.390> sign

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
see we got the power switch sign

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.750 
see we got the power switch sign
pointing<00:02:59.530> upwards<00:03:00.070> so<00:03:00.400> there's<00:03:00.549> going<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.730> be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
pointing upwards so there's going to be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.180 
pointing upwards so there's going to be
some<00:03:00.940> stairs<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.450> pistol<00:03:01.959> looks<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.739> an<00:03:02.860> m9

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
some stairs that pistol looks like an m9

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.130 
some stairs that pistol looks like an m9
no<00:03:03.370> no<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.730> looks<00:03:03.880> like<00:03:04.030> Colt<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.600> grip<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
no no it looks like Colt the grip you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.650 
no no it looks like Colt the grip you
can<00:03:05.260> see<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.440> little<00:03:05.739> orange<00:03:06.280> bit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
can see that little orange bit

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.170 
can see that little orange bit
definitely<00:03:07.660> looks<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.019> cult<00:03:08.790> ammo<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.090> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
definitely looks like a cult ammo on the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.390 
definitely looks like a cult ammo on the
bottom<00:03:10.510> right<00:03:10.720> around<00:03:11.500> five<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.250> bottom

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
bottom right around five in the bottom

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.729 
bottom right around five in the bottom
left<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.060> looks<00:03:13.390> pretty<00:03:13.750> real<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.260> only<00:03:14.290> thing

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
left it looks pretty real the only thing

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.250 
left it looks pretty real the only thing
is<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.010> hand<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:16.030> person<00:03:16.450> actually<00:03:16.690> holding

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
is the hand the person actually holding

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.830 
is the hand the person actually holding
oh<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:18.190> don't<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.880> his<00:03:19.180> skin<00:03:19.570> if<00:03:19.720> you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
oh I don't think that's his skin if you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.730 
oh I don't think that's his skin if you
looked<00:03:20.049> at<00:03:20.170> his

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
looked at his

like<00:05:01.280> three<00:05:01.550> little<00:05:01.730> tick<00:05:02.060> marks<00:05:02.090> if<00:05:02.900> the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
like three little tick marks if the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.570 
like three little tick marks if the
compass<00:05:03.440> on<00:05:03.590> their<00:05:03.830> nose<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:04.250> then<00:05:04.400> there'd<00:05:04.580> be

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
compass on their nose so then there'd be

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.300 
compass on their nose so then there'd be
four<00:05:05.570> that's<00:05:06.440> kind<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.680> weird<00:05:06.740> tell<00:05:07.130> me<00:05:07.190> what

all I'm gonna say look at the map this

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.750 
all I'm gonna say look at the map this
is<00:05:21.230> horrible<00:05:21.680> if<00:05:21.890> this<00:05:22.010> was<00:05:22.160> a<00:05:22.190> multiplayer

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
is horrible if this was a multiplayer

is horrible if this was a multiplayer
map<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:24.080> would<00:05:24.200> be<00:05:24.230> horrible<00:05:24.740> there's<00:05:25.010> just

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
map this would be horrible there's just

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.430 
map this would be horrible there's just
nothing<00:05:25.640> that's<00:05:25.760> better<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.600> got<00:05:26.870> points<00:05:27.290> it

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
inconsistent that this one's definitely

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.950 
inconsistent that this one's definitely
fake<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.370> cannot<00:05:40.640> be<00:05:40.700> mad<00:05:41.150> multi<00:05:41.510> player<00:05:41.720> or

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.380 
see this being any sort of matt besides
like<00:05:50.810> an<00:05:50.960> MW<00:05:51.380> 3<00:05:51.730> i'm<00:05:52.730> not<00:05:52.910> sure<00:05:53.120> how<00:05:53.240> it

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
like an MW 3 i'm not sure how it

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.399 
like an MW 3 i'm not sure how it
happened<00:05:53.420> but<00:05:53.780> they<00:05:53.990> had<00:05:54.140> like<00:05:54.350> all<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:54.650> guns

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
happened but they had like all the guns

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:56.929 
happened but they had like all the guns
loading<00:05:55.709> in<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.830> air<00:05:56.009> on<00:05:56.249> some<00:05:56.489> math<00:05:56.729> that

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
loading in the air on some math that

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:58.969 
loading in the air on some math that
looked<00:05:57.149> a<00:05:57.239> lot<00:05:57.479> like<00:05:57.539> this<00:05:58.019> it<00:05:58.679> was<00:05:58.800> kind<00:05:58.949> of

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
looked a lot like this it was kind of

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.169 
looked a lot like this it was kind of
like<00:05:59.069> a<00:05:59.129> little<00:05:59.339> testing<00:05:59.729> ground<00:05:59.999> so<00:06:00.149> that

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:00.179 
like a little testing ground so that

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:02.689 
like a little testing ground so that
might<00:06:00.449> be<00:06:00.479> something<00:06:00.599> like<00:06:00.929> this<00:06:00.989> but<00:06:01.439> um<00:06:01.709> I<00:06:02.009> do

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
might be something like this but um I do

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.689 
might be something like this but um I do
know<00:06:03.059> that<00:06:03.089> this<00:06:03.419> is<00:06:04.189> definitely<00:06:05.189> not<00:06:05.339> a<00:06:05.399> map

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
know that this is definitely not a map

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.179 
know that this is definitely not a map
that<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:05.909> play<00:06:06.239> on<00:06:06.300> now<00:06:07.019> this<00:06:07.229> literally<00:06:08.039> is

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
that you play on now this literally is

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.589 
that you play on now this literally is
probably<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.789> best<00:06:09.029> thing<00:06:09.119> that<00:06:09.330> we<00:06:09.419> have<00:06:09.449> to

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
probably the best thing that we have to

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.109 
probably the best thing that we have to
go<00:06:09.899> on<00:06:10.080> right<00:06:10.439> now<00:06:10.469> and<00:06:10.769> this<00:06:11.519> is<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.789> one<00:06:11.939> that

00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:12.119 
go on right now and this is the one that

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.449 
go on right now and this is the one that
I<00:06:12.149> like<00:06:12.419> the<00:06:12.449> most<00:06:12.769> pretty<00:06:13.769> much<00:06:13.979> because<00:06:14.339> it

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:14.459 
I like the most pretty much because it

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.729 
I like the most pretty much because it
confirms<00:06:14.789> my<00:06:15.089> theory<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.659> that<00:06:16.229> dude<00:06:16.499> being

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:16.739 
confirms my theory of that dude being

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:18.889 
confirms my theory of that dude being
Harper<00:06:17.279> his<00:06:17.819> name<00:06:18.119> if<00:06:18.389> you<00:06:18.419> haven't<00:06:18.719> seen<00:06:18.839> that
