00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
chapter all the much better so basically

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.660 
chapter all the much better so basically
i<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.590> fighting<00:01:43.950> scenes<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.430> send<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
i like the fighting scenes with send to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
i like the fighting scenes with send to
shatter<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> action<00:01:46.200> within<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
shatter and I like the action within the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
shatter and I like the action within the
chapter<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.979> well<00:01:47.190> an<00:01:47.400> explanation<00:01:48.030> was

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
chapter as well an explanation was

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
chapter as well an explanation was
actually<00:01:48.780> pretty<00:01:49.049> good<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.560> explanation

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
actually pretty good this explanation

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.240 
actually pretty good this explanation
was<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.850> easier<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> follow<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.680> hundred

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
was a lot easier to follow and a hundred

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.490 
was a lot easier to follow and a hundred
times<00:01:53.430> better<00:01:53.850> than<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.869> Izanami

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
times better than the Izanami

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230 
times better than the Izanami
explanation<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.400> fantastic<00:01:56.640> because

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
explanation which is fantastic because

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.820 
explanation which is fantastic because
we<00:01:57.510> actually<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.020> something<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.440> compare

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
we actually have something to compare

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.810 
we actually have something to compare
this<00:01:59.159> to<00:02:00.470> basically<00:02:01.470> what<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.860> seems<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.340> me<00:02:02.549> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this to basically what it seems to me is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
this to basically what it seems to me is
that<00:02:02.880> kubo<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.630> saying<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> guy<00:02:04.560> can

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that kubo was saying that it's a guy can

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
that kubo was saying that it's a guy can
easily<00:02:05.130> kill<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.820> Eddie<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> my

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
easily kill my Eddie it's just that my

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.770 
easily kill my Eddie it's just that my
UT<00:02:07.380> had<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.740> drug<00:02:08.070> which<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:09.119> guess<00:02:09.750> makes

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
UT had this drug which I guess makes

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.170 
UT had this drug which I guess makes
sense<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:11.040> not<00:02:11.190> putting<00:02:11.459> any<00:02:11.580> bias<00:02:11.880> here

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
sense and I'm not putting any bias here

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.729 
sense and I'm not putting any bias here
because<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> guy<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.170> my<00:02:13.410> favorite

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
because it's a guy is my favorite

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.360 
because it's a guy is my favorite
character<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.280> Bleach<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.989> even<00:02:16.440> my<00:02:16.860> UT<00:02:17.070> said

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
character in Bleach but even my UT said

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
character in Bleach but even my UT said
himself<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.570> chapter<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.200> he<00:02:19.260> was

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
himself in this chapter when he was

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
what he does and at the same time is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.800 
what he does and at the same time is
showing<00:03:37.800> off<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.070> my<00:03:38.430> UT<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:39.239> hold<00:03:39.480> his<00:03:39.600> own

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.990 
showing off that my UT can hold his own
against<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.739> character<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.220> technically

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
against a character that technically

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.990 
against a character that technically
should<00:03:42.330> be<00:03:42.450> stronger<00:03:42.870> than<00:03:42.959> him<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.730> he<00:03:44.730> also

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
should be stronger than him and he also

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.170 
should be stronger than him and he also
amidst<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.750> himself<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.770> chapter<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.760> it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
amidst this himself in the chapter so it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.449 
amidst this himself in the chapter so it
plays<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.480> best<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.959> both<00:03:49.110> worlds<00:03:49.560> basically

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
plays the best of both worlds basically

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.130 
plays the best of both worlds basically
his<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> guy<00:03:50.850> can't<00:03:51.239> technically<00:03:51.660> win<00:03:51.930> because

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
his a guy can't technically win because

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.670 
his a guy can't technically win because
right<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:53.040> he's<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.970> bad<00:03:54.450> guy<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.019> right<00:03:55.500> now

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
right now he's a bad guy and right now

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.740 
right now he's a bad guy and right now
he's<00:03:55.920> fighting<00:03:56.100> for<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.430> wrong<00:03:56.580> cause<00:03:56.910> but

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
he's fighting for the wrong cause but

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.380
