so let's go and run through the back the
back<00:02:17.930> right<00:02:18.290> there<00:02:18.530> has<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> two-tone<00:02:19.940> trigger

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
back right there has a two-tone trigger

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030 
back right there has a two-tone trigger
on<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:24.140> part<00:02:24.410> here<00:02:24.590> where<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> sync<00:02:25.010> button

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
on this part here where the sync button

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.900 
on this part here where the sync button
is<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.400> doesn't<00:02:28.460> work<00:02:28.700> okay<00:02:29.090> cool

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
is it's like it doesn't work okay cool

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.110 
is it's like it doesn't work okay cool
so<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.980> two<00:02:34.220> toned<00:02:34.490> so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so you have that that's two toned so

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.230 
so you have that that's two toned so
that<00:02:35.240> makes<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.570> four<00:02:35.810> colors<00:02:36.140> if<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:38.090> was

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
that makes it four colors if that was

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.800 
that makes it four colors if that was
all<00:02:38.510> black<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.130> controller<00:02:40.810> would
