00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.099
 i 23 hours the people the personal well say 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 One more video of today I will teach how 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 do a raffle you finally have 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 request for comment times 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 this is the fourth time that I 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.609
 I'll try to explain why choking 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.750
 enough with him to explain something 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.460
 easy 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 I'm not quite sure what to say but not 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 I'll try is and why you have asked. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.550
 enough because I have made great 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.290
 part of my stuff using two 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.000
 raffles to be part of the chronicles 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.950
 sport here will do the part of the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.660
 existence of the gun internal house in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 front but this one for example not 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 is here internally has it here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:55.829
 to give a good structure is here 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:58.109
 end up doing propaganda does not go out to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.969
 listening was not very simple and 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:08.430
 also for making the parties ahead 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.930
 to stabilize the sling team o 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 Coach, these things I'll leave the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 place of arms at registration 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.110
 there lack here also this one is the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.110
 team I did with 33 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.710
 I also made some stops there and do not have 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 more so as not to have the claws of the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.290
 play and do not even do it to do there 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.290
 What is next to us? 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.619
 a4 sheet you can use a sheet which the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.360
 that is and to help guide and not in 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.189
 first 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.570
 so in order to make a square of a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.570
 side and the other 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.799
 I'll deal with the link for you here. 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.799
 best 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.909
 also here also the lines thus 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.060
 direction you guys are going to have to go there 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.060
 I'm leaving 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.829
 It is this way and ends more or 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.989
 less so help 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.579
 once with two fingers will get there 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.249
 front to back to front and back 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.530
 from the front to the back is enough mouse 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:24.230
 in this part it tended to go there 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.180
 forward, there's Mike and 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.040
 curly looks at course is not well 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.389
 It is clear that neither the trend 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.049
 of rolling up to is and then only with two of 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.909
 each side and looking forward has arrived 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.650
 to me that you have to go back from 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.709
 you do not drop everything and come back with the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.349
 both simultaneously handle 12 is 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.599
 back and back back and miss 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.329
 plus a wildcard back behind 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.120
 I'll be back if you look here soon 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:01.739
 it will become less resistant 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:03.840
 then when they have good frills 22 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.769
 basically was to continue signing the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.590
 matter here 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:15.269
 Now I 'm going to curl offspring and I 'm going to press 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.099
 against the table in the front I want 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:24.049
 go back to the mam by hand and then 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.049
 with the other and until reaching the final 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.729
 in the end you have to learn so that 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.939
 this will not be an item stay like this could 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:37.349
 hold the other hand pulled 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.030
 Rita learn I liked it down here. 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.269
 simplify the company 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:49.349
 then it's just a miracle holding me 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:53.280
 so on the tape and is already in their head 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:58.150
 tried to land together 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.349
 the cathedral is so ready three still have 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.349
 to store instant
