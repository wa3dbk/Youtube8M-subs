because we never saw that in the second

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
because we never saw that in the second
one<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.170> saw<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.439> gotten<00:01:10.920> battling<00:01:11.310> the

this is going to be in the third one it
might<00:01:19.530> possibly<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.250> maybe<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> fourth

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
