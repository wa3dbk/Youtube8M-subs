00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.050
 and I thank God first 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.710
 because the 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.780
 he made his miracle of giving us 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.600
 These little houses that I dreamed so much 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.810
 because I saw that I said I would like my 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.910
 little house that I said so I asked 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.099
 I said goodbye to them half that 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.640
 they did to my little house I told them and I looked 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.239
 God listened to me and at least what 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.820
 we thought there was the little house she is 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.130
 graciela garcÃ­a one of the beneficiaries 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 with one of the 17 homes of the 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.539
 colony santa rosa de lima in the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 Cuilapa municipality of the Department of 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.620
 santa rosa the homes were 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.170
 built with funds donated by the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.149
 pontifical council cor unum la 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.609
 Vatican institution that distributes to 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.070
 the economic funds received by the 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.230
 santa sede- represented by dad 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.940
 francisco and we started knocking on doors 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.390
 to get some help for 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.250
 people and we also see the visit in 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 that time that apostolic announcement that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 He told us to ask for his position 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.580
 which is called by one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 and a heart wants to say it then 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.980
 we asked and they supported us to do 17 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 houses and a chapel 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.990
 So that's how we managed to support 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.240
 said 17 families that in the first place 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.490
 that were of scarce resources then 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.520
 also that they had been affected so much 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.160
 by the strong tremors as they have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560
 pollination of the river initiative 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.480
 arose after the natural disasters that 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.520
 affected the community the 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.350
 beneficiaries remember that they lost 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.180
 all your belongings when you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.340
 overflowed the river san juan 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 shortly after a swarm of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.070
 earthquakes worsened the situation because everything 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.350
 that we have everything is effective everything not in 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.100
 that the river was taken away, not everything 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 the study we put clothes wardrobe everything 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.280
 what but I never had never 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.170
 I imagined that here in Cuilapa I was going to 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 do one because if one hears so many 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.120
 works that makes it true but I never 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.310
 I imagined that here in Cuilapa or that I was going 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.080

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.960

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.280
 of these communities because God has 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.280
