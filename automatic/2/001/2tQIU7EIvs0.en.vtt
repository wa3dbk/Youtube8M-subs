for such a massively ambitious project

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.759 
for such a massively ambitious project
like<00:02:37.360> Neo<00:02:37.480> Tokyo<00:02:37.599> we<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.440> wanted<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> make

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
like Neo Tokyo we really wanted to make

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.410 
like Neo Tokyo we really wanted to make
sure<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.250> were<00:02:39.340> using<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:40.239> best

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
sure that we were using the best

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.420 
sure that we were using the best
cutting-edge<00:02:40.870> technology<00:02:41.410> possible<00:02:41.829> so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
cutting-edge technology possible so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.470 
cutting-edge technology possible so
we've<00:02:42.579> chosen<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.940> go<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.239> Unreal

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
we've chosen to go with the Unreal

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.180 
we've chosen to go with the Unreal
Engine<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:44.349> know<00:02:44.440> because<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:44.829> really<00:02:45.069> well

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
Engine you know because it's really well

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.740 
Engine you know because it's really well
recognized<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.940> an<00:02:46.090> industry-leading

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
recognized as an industry-leading

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.630 
recognized as an industry-leading
platform<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:48.010> means<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.370> we'll<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.519> able

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
platform and it means that we'll be able

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.069 
platform and it means that we'll be able
to<00:02:48.760> really<00:02:49.000> ensure<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.780> usually

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
to really ensure that the usually

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.780 
to really ensure that the usually
getting<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.379> best<00:02:50.620> quality<00:02:50.769> product<00:02:51.190> both

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
getting the best quality product both

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.650 
getting the best quality product both
now<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.329> future

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
now and in the future

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.680 
now and in the future
I<00:02:53.220> think<00:02:54.220> we<00:02:54.280> can<00:02:54.430> make<00:02:54.579> need<00:02:55.090> soap<00:02:55.299> into<00:02:55.569> a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
I think we can make need soap into a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.479 
I think we can make need soap into a
virtual<00:02:56.019> playground<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> virtual<00:02:57.040> feedback

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
virtual playground in a virtual feedback

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.210 
virtual playground in a virtual feedback
and<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:59.049> emergent<00:02:59.470> technologies<00:03:00.010> things

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and the emergent technologies things

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.720 
and the emergent technologies things
like<00:03:00.459> oculus<00:03:00.940> VR<00:03:01.690> Lisbon<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.730> absolutely

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
like oculus VR Lisbon is absolutely

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.400 
like oculus VR Lisbon is absolutely
perfect<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.109> perfect<00:03:05.349> environment

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
perfect and it's the perfect environment

perfect and it's the perfect environment
community<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.920> absolutely<00:03:09.299> fundamental

everything<00:03:19.270> we<00:03:19.600> grew<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:19.840> as<00:03:20.230> developers<00:03:21.600> this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
everything we grew up as developers this

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.870 
everything we grew up as developers this
is<00:03:22.780> fo<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:22.990> piloting<00:03:23.860> before<00:03:24.400> which<00:03:24.550> at<00:03:24.700> home

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
is fo the piloting before which at home

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.610 
is fo the piloting before which at home
we<00:03:25.000> developed<00:03:25.420> beyond<00:03:25.960> the<00:03:26.080> point<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.350> nature

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
we developed beyond the point of nature

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.060 
we developed beyond the point of nature
starts<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.840> most<00:03:29.350> exciting<00:03:29.800> about<00:03:29.890> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
starts this is most exciting about the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.460 
starts this is most exciting about the
project<00:03:30.160> who<00:03:30.520> knows<00:03:30.870> exactly<00:03:31.870> where<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
project who knows exactly where the
