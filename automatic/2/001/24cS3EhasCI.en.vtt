00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the inception of the idea to when I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
the inception of the idea to when I
actually<00:00:28.199> played<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:29.310> other<00:00:29.580> musicians

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
actually played it with other musicians

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
actually played it with other musicians
and<00:00:30.529> then<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.679> break<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.920> down<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and then I'm gonna break it down and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.110 
and then I'm gonna break it down and
then<00:00:33.239> I'll<00:00:33.329> play<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> speed<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> only

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
then I'll play it up to speed the only

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.520 
then I'll play it up to speed the only
thing<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> say<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.410> think

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
thing I want to say is that I just think

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.100 
thing I want to say is that I just think
it's<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.890> important<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.960> what<00:00:39.960> we're

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it's really important that what we're

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 
it's really important that what we're
doing<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> practice<00:00:40.950> room<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:42.540> should

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
doing in the practice room we should

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350 
doing in the practice room we should
always<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.170> mind<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:44.180> bringing<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
always have in mind about bringing it to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
always have in mind about bringing it to
the<00:00:45.450> table<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> playing<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.860> other

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
thing and just have fun with a new idea

00:00:54.390 --> 00:02:14.910 
thing and just have fun with a new idea
all<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.379> yeah

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.930 

all<00:02:15.920> right<00:02:16.040> I'm<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> break<00:02:16.489> down<00:02:16.520> what's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
all right I'm going to break down what's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.630 
all right I'm going to break down what's
happening<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.390> both<00:02:17.569> videos<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.400> same

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
happening in both videos in the same

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180 
happening in both videos in the same
demonstration<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:20.780> that's<00:02:21.170> because<00:02:21.500> they're

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
demonstration and that's because they're

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.850 
demonstration and that's because they're
both<00:02:22.760> almost<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.540> same<00:02:23.750> thing<00:02:24.110> with<00:02:24.440> only<00:02:24.770> a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
both almost the same thing with only a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.240 
both almost the same thing with only a
slight<00:02:25.040> variation<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:27.200> right<00:02:27.349> hand<00:02:27.620> so

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
slight variation on the right hand so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.100 
slight variation on the right hand so
it's<00:02:28.580> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.730> start<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.870> kick<00:02:30.080> drum

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
it's going to start with the kick drum

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.860 
it's going to start with the kick drum
being<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.280> dotted<00:02:31.730> eighth<00:02:31.849> notes<00:02:32.209> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
being on all dotted eighth notes so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.650 
being on all dotted eighth notes so
that's<00:02:33.050> one<00:02:33.830> E<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.010> uh<00:02:34.400> two<00:02:34.430> E<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.819> AH<00:02:35.239> three<00:02:35.269> E

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
that's one E and uh two E and AH three E

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.100 
that's one E and uh two E and AH three E
and<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:36.110> four<00:02:36.140> E<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.590> AH<00:02:37.040> over<00:02:37.690> time<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.870> sounds

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
and a four E and AH over time it sounds

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:51.940 
and a four E and AH over time it sounds
like<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.380> one<00:02:39.980> two<00:02:40.700> three<00:02:41.540> four<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:51.080> on<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
like this one two three four and on the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.970 
like this one two three four and on the
snare<00:02:52.100> drum<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:53.690> basically<00:02:54.260> eighth

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
snare drum it's just basically eighth

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.270 
snare drum it's just basically eighth
notes<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:56.390> accenting<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.260> backbeat<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.130> it

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
notes with accenting the backbeat so it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:16.839 
notes with accenting the backbeat so it
sounds<00:02:58.519> like<00:02:58.640> this

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.640 

so<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.410> first<00:03:19.530> video<00:03:19.910> I've<00:03:20.910> got<00:03:21.650> this

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so in the first video I've got this

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.619 
so in the first video I've got this
little<00:03:22.890> trashy<00:03:23.220> guy<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.489> made<00:03:23.819> up<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.390> an

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
little trashy guy I made up with an

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.339 
little trashy guy I made up with an
alpha<00:03:25.049> Swiss<00:03:25.530> crash<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.989> some<00:03:27.989> other<00:03:28.110> crazy

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
alpha Swiss crash and some other crazy

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.979 
alpha Swiss crash and some other crazy
symbol<00:03:28.769> underneath<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.660> basically<00:03:30.660> playing

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
symbol underneath it basically playing

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.400 
symbol underneath it basically playing
every<00:03:31.440> other<00:03:31.590> dotted<00:03:32.459> eighth<00:03:32.580> note<00:03:33.410> so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
every other dotted eighth note so

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.440 
every other dotted eighth note so
together<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.640> group<00:03:35.879> sounds<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.269> this

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
together that group sounds like this

00:03:36.450 --> 00:04:15.129 
together that group sounds like this
slowly<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:56.700> sped<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.180> sounds<00:03:58.079> like<00:03:58.200> this

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.390 

now<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.200> only<00:04:16.410> thing<00:04:16.680> I'm<00:04:16.799> doing<00:04:17.039> different

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
now the only thing I'm doing different

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.539 
now the only thing I'm doing different
in<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.060> video<00:04:18.299> where<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.870> playing<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.320> along

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
in the video where I'm playing it along

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.210 
in the video where I'm playing it along
over<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.760> keyboard<00:04:21.150> solo<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.650> I'm<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.830> keeping

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
over a keyboard solo is I'm just keeping

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.339 
over a keyboard solo is I'm just keeping
steady<00:04:23.760> eighth<00:04:24.000> notes<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> ride<00:04:25.110> cymbal

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
steady eighth notes on the ride cymbal

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.100 
steady eighth notes on the ride cymbal
along<00:04:25.919> with<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.360> slowed<00:04:27.360> down<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.660> sounds

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
along with it slowed down that sounds

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:48.550 
along with it slowed down that sounds
