 So she did 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.419
 Of course, that can work 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.840
 Percent of new people on YouTube so new commented and who help 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.940
 would like to become a little bit better known 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.150
 I want to make this send 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.660
 yes we say it was such a cool idea of ​​them to do the whole thing 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.310
 apparently hinted 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.330
 since they have already loaded at the MuK and Röth do something like that 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.330
 which one is his own comment about Opel we are cool 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 finally instead of just Domhof for the SSG 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.710
 Percent of 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 needed was then quite well in front of our readers then 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.490
 30 porridge 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.070
 Royalty but no idea because I made up my mind 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 he really does not mean anything 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.690
 Fincher Huth foul 58 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460
 how right she sees me on YouTube yes how do I get on YouTube and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.470
 though off 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.920
 With blends, many say it recorded its very first gameplay 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.080
 on Youtube 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.060
 Percent if I already have it so I have seen there 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.410
 At that time already wanted from normal years about all routes 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.820
 but always left over 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.290
 also soon recovered in HDTV 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.250
 Thanks to the whole table I have always been a little bit better 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.270
 So this game would be good as I mean 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.290
 very much better I used to be really honest 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.140
 Kemper that was already 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.360
 if possible the daily squat in the corner with Common thus remains icy 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.210
 suddenly it would have been to the grape 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.760
 and yes, all that CNS could do is really very cool Asus 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.199
 really fun animal bite comment 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.359
 Somehow, so what does not work now does not matter what it is not that we do 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.359
 about Kurt Bächle full of saying so cool thing 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.660
 here that is 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.290
 What is with me again 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.249
 because he is on the channel 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.429
 is currently percent you can dance 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.699
 be taken and Abbas come 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.429
 For the latter I have also loaded but still in any case 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.889
 For a while, at the moment only the end of twelfth 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.199
 because one 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.779
 by being that 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.999
 yes the thrill filter year so I can speak a prophet guest of honor 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.789
 say what eat loose higher degrees loose 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.569
 but just missing there 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.399
 important thing in the game so for me 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.399
 may it be because of the order page Noemi 2 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.649
 and yes I would say very very fine he will do on a channel 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:58.929
 Scots 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.249
 that was a good 40 percent so there are a few things 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.249
 how much this is very good gameplay to each other 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:11.549
 if you like it you can leave me years in Arboga and why there 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.149
 to let 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.879
 Comment because you leave everything you want I was anyway almost anyway 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.739
 Comment so almost every question 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.260
 because both I am very pleased we go with open channel too 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.189
 because I too 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 and why a Hungarian Laszlo does not like me do that if that's good what I do 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.479
 Percent would be very cool by Eich 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.319
 either strife should rejoice silver 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.319
 I'm looking forward to doing the gameplay here 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.239
 Percent two the oldest is really very cool of him »view that 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.609
 I often say that 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.409
 that's what he's taking his time for that's and the duck himself 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.139
 then listen again later 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.999
 and after that, if she loves me to shop 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999

 Anyone with whom there are definitely still a few things 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.370
 I did not pick this important topic for him 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.949
 this Commentary 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.300
 that was just a bit of a tactical takeover or is there 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.319
 Not really about the gameplay, it's easy to end like I did 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.840
 get my hat 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.889
