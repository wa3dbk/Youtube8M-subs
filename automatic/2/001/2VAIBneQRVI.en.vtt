and break it down the first part of it
I'll<00:00:36.180> discuss<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> chords<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.320> chords<00:00:38.190> are

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I'll discuss the chords the chords are

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.110 
I'll discuss the chords the chords are
East<00:00:38.489> 7<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> B<00:00:40.050> 5<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> two

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
East 7 so a B 5 and you got the two

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.440 
East 7 so a B 5 and you got the two
notes<00:00:42.300> D<00:00:42.719> sharp<00:00:43.020> -<00:00:43.530> an<00:00:43.649> E<00:00:44.090> if<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> want<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
notes D sharp - an E if you want to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
notes D sharp - an E if you want to
think<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> those<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.020> passing<00:00:46.440> tones<00:00:46.680> it's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
think of those as passing tones it's

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240 
think of those as passing tones it's
fine<00:00:47.600> then<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.020> goes<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.469> C<00:00:49.680> sharp<00:00:49.920> minor<00:00:50.070> 7

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
fine then it goes to a C sharp minor 7

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
fine then it goes to a C sharp minor 7
which<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.969> relative<00:00:51.420> minor<00:00:51.629> above<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> B

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
which is a relative minor above the B

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.240 
which is a relative minor above the B
then<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> goes<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:53.940> E<00:00:54.030> major<00:00:54.210> arpeggio

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
then it goes back to an E major arpeggio

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.520 
then it goes back to an E major arpeggio
to<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.370> age<00:00:56.489> 7<00:00:56.969> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.079> Eric<00:00:58.289> Johnson

reminds<00:01:00.809> me<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.739> goes<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
reminds me of then goes back to the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
reminds me of then goes back to the
relative<00:01:03.120> minor<00:01:03.270> C<00:01:03.660> sharp<00:01:03.899> minor<00:01:04.019> 7<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
relative minor C sharp minor 7 it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
relative minor C sharp minor 7 it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
first part and I'll be doing a video and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:24.160 
first part and I'll be doing a video and
showing<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> second<00:01:11.070> Thanks

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.360 

okay<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> first<00:01:25.500> part<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.250> e7<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> b5

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
okay the first part is an e7 to a b5

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:50.630 
okay the first part is an e7 to a b5
with<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> passing<00:01:29.910> tone<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> Adi<00:01:30.540> Shakti<00:01:49.640> then

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
with the passing tone of Adi Shakti then

00:01:50.640 --> 00:02:10.370 
with the passing tone of Adi Shakti then
it<00:01:50.760> doesn't<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.360> sharp<00:01:51.750> minor<00:01:51.960> 7<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> on<00:02:09.380> he

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it doesn't see sharp minor 7 so on he

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.280 
it doesn't see sharp minor 7 so on he
goes<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.830> major<00:02:11.180> arpeggio<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.750> an<00:02:12.840> 8<00:02:12.960> 7

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
goes to a major arpeggio to an 8 7

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:28.400 
goes to a major arpeggio to an 8 7
arpeggio<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:26.959> slides<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.170> from<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
arpeggio think of slides up from a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.880 
arpeggio think of slides up from a
c-sharp<00:02:29.010> minor<00:02:29.400> 7
