 finally create the attacking midfielder as well. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.409
 r

 and I finished the interview 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 which is something that has long been 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.539
 they want to have 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:24.819
 the building 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.380
 You're not going to put 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.740
 so the front 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.829
 while at 45 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.750
 your share if you do not put to go to mass 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.130
 suddenly score every now and then if you have 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 it's in the championship every 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.350
 does not get into the document 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.500
 ef 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.270
 she is home here 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940
 4 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.290
 starks occupied by a top 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.920
 it's a club that there's no way to compete with local artists than the customer 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.860
 is here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.720
 now 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 now the pec 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.660
 the current law can not retroactively 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.220
 has belongs to the government 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.180
 the camera meets the paranavaí 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 This is what happens 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.149
 you do not feel like it 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.620
 the actor and ipioca bullet case as change 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.390
 the interview happened 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.210
 on friday 14 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.220
 in the same row of the roundabout I am in the same column 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.410
 so how are you quoted to have preference? 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.170
 modern housing for home 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.480
 to highlight here for example until this one 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.150
 it's not this 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.120
 carpegiani will play here 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.340
 and really for the pasta center is to treat comic face fact is common here but in the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.070
 paper 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.020
 I'll put 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 I'm here turner migrants 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.580
 well 4 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.980
 for him 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.480
 2004 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.090
 in the athlete's house must reach 34 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 he could talk specifically about the colored goal 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.830
 everton sena milena 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.620
 time is different 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 there technical note teams too 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.019
 but she's really putting on steam 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.390
 d4 here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.809
 it is important that you place 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:20.409
 the minutes with the name of the house is the picture of each panetone hi 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.320
 you will see 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.759
 will show in operation 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.519
 the house of legal origin 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.970
 So if that was the point of this house here, I could put 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.359
 r 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.919
 air 4 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.289
 back off 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.050
 so now there's no way to not know 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.840
 it's that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.190
 satore here 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.099
 and you came to stay and it's not 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.940
 which affected line 4 p 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.509
 there are 4 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.659
 if duck the funeral now the movement especially 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.790
 how important it is to define 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.109
 the vice-premier of movements 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.100
 however I preferred then 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.189
 to some sites 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.039
 in swimming 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.319
 first thing 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.939
 senai also the game here 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.069
 we know that here a check the referee gives a check 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.289
 the ninth birthday 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.540
 so presently are what you would do 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.999
 the opening of the board 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.409
 n adapting cb 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.569
 that's hardly important 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.879
 How did I say the nal in movement? 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.669

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.019
 no or have a fine 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.019

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.699
 6 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.699
 what did he do 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.919
 it would only be the student was enough however the new movement equipment 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.009
