underneath<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.840> cover<00:00:04.140> right<00:00:04.380> here<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:04.740> your

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
underneath this cover right here is your

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.280 
underneath this cover right here is your
time<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.160> Cheney<00:00:05.549> time<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.029> gear<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:07.080> pull

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
time and Cheney time and gear we pull

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.680 
time and Cheney time and gear we pull
this<00:00:07.440> off<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.250> can<00:00:08.429> liven<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.240> timing

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
this off so we can liven up the timing

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.589 
this off so we can liven up the timing
marks<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> lobes<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> cam<00:00:12.150> will<00:00:12.480> be

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
marks so the lobes on the cam will be

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.230 
marks so the lobes on the cam will be
pointing<00:00:13.019> down<00:00:13.490> that<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.759> adjust<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
pointing down that we can adjust the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.320 
pointing down that we can adjust the
valves<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> intake<00:00:16.170> valve<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.330> adjusted

valves the intake valve it is a adjusted
two<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.869> four<00:00:19.199> thousandths<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> exhaust

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
two to four thousandths and the exhaust

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.070 
two to four thousandths and the exhaust
valve<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.820> four<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.689> six<00:00:26.630> all<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.960> what

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
thousand Squealer gage and you just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.570 
thousand Squealer gage and you just
slide<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.360> between<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.980> top<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.160> your<00:03:24.280> valve

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
slide it between the top of your valve

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.970 
slide it between the top of your valve
and<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.900> bottom<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.290> your<00:03:26.320> rocker<00:03:26.620> arm<00:03:27.810> and

and the bottom of your rocker arm and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.740 
and the bottom of your rocker arm and
this<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.190> pretty<00:03:30.460> loose<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:31.240> don't<00:03:31.270> have<00:03:31.570> any

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
this is pretty loose you don't have any

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.570 
this is pretty loose you don't have any
drag<00:03:32.110> at<00:03:32.320> all<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.620> want<00:03:32.800> to<00:03:32.890> feel<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> slight

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
drag at all you want to feel a slight

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.380 
drag at all you want to feel a slight
drag<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.430> feeler<00:03:36.700> gauge<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.180> we're<00:03:37.300> going

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
drag on the feeler gauge so we're going

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.480 
drag on the feeler gauge so we're going
to<00:03:37.450> go<00:03:37.570> ahead<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.870> adjust<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:39.070> is<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.250> 10

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
to go ahead and adjust this this is a 10

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.510 
to go ahead and adjust this this is a 10
millimeter<00:03:42.000> bolt<00:03:43.000> are<00:03:43.330> not<00:03:43.860> they<00:03:44.860> just<00:03:44.890> loosen

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
millimeter bolt are not they just loosen

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.590 
millimeter bolt are not they just loosen
it<00:03:45.580> up<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.000> there's<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.050> little<00:03:47.170> square<00:03:47.620> screw

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
it up and there's a little square screw

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.650 
it up and there's a little square screw
that<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.720> just<00:03:49.900> turn<00:03:50.110> down<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.450> is<00:03:52.630> a

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
that you just turn down so this is a

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.270 
that you just turn down so this is a
4000<00:03:53.440> I'm<00:03:53.560> going<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.770> adjust<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.160> in<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
4000 I'm going to adjust it in the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:07.880 
4000 I'm going to adjust it in the
middle<00:03:54.640> at<00:03:56.100> 3,000

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.350 

all<00:04:08.890> right<00:04:09.099> so<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.280> take<00:04:09.370> my<00:04:09.550> three<00:04:09.910> thousands

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
all right so I take my three thousands

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.610 
all right so I take my three thousands
and<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.599> slide<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.140> there

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.969 

then<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> tighten<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.220> little<00:04:15.519> square<00:04:16.090> screw

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
then I tighten this little square screw

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.530 
then I tighten this little square screw
down<00:04:17.979> until<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.430> feel<00:04:18.669> drag<00:04:19.030> now<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.329> can<00:04:19.510> be

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
down until I feel drag now this can be

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.939 
down until I feel drag now this can be
tricky<00:04:19.810> because<00:04:20.049> when<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.320> tighten<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.769> nut

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
tricky because when you tighten the nut

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:41.040 
tricky because when you tighten the nut
back<00:04:21.160> up<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:22.870> change<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.590> all<00:04:23.710> on<00:04:23.949> you

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.869 

and<00:04:41.590> see<00:04:41.860> right<00:04:42.009> there<00:04:42.280> when<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.490> tighten<00:04:42.699> that

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
and see right there when I tighten that

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:51.559 
and see right there when I tighten that
up<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.270> too<00:04:43.479> tight<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:47.889> back<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.400> off

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.339 

readjust<00:04:53.940> try<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> little<00:04:55.240> bit<00:04:55.539> different

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
readjust try a little bit different

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:07.909 
readjust try a little bit different
position<00:04:56.830> I<00:05:03.720> think<00:05:04.720> we<00:05:04.930> got<00:05:05.110> her<00:05:05.259> this<00:05:05.440> time

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.260 

yep<00:05:08.919> we've<00:05:09.250> got<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.639> a<00:05:09.789> slight<00:05:10.360> drag<00:05:10.960> there

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
yep we've got just a slight drag there

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.730 
yep we've got just a slight drag there
now<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:13.479> valves<00:05:13.810> all<00:05:13.960> adjusted<00:05:16.530> now<00:05:17.530> one

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
now that valves all adjusted now one

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.080 
now that valves all adjusted now one
thing<00:05:17.949> to<00:05:18.069> check<00:05:18.099> when<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.580> put<00:05:18.759> your<00:05:18.909> valve

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
thing to check when you put your valve

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.939 
thing to check when you put your valve
cover<00:05:19.180> back<00:05:19.569> on<00:05:22.470> don't<00:05:23.470> move

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
cover back on don't move

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.680 
cover back on don't move
you'll<00:05:24.190> see<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.639> there's<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.909> little<00:05:25.240> on<00:05:25.509> the

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
you'll see that there's a little on the

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.559 
you'll see that there's a little on the
Yamahas<00:05:26.460> there's<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.520> little<00:05:27.819> ledge<00:05:28.000> up<00:05:28.270> here

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
Yamahas there's a little ledge up here

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.350 
Yamahas there's a little ledge up here
and<00:05:28.930> what<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.069> -<00:05:30.370> go<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.729> goes<00:05:31.060> towards

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
and what that is - go that goes towards

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.820 
and what that is - go that goes towards
the<00:05:31.419> top<00:05:31.659> because<00:05:31.900> what<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.050> does<00:05:32.349> then<00:05:32.380> is

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
the top because what that does then is

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.469 
the top because what that does then is
it<00:05:33.009> collects<00:05:33.280> oil<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.729> drips<00:05:33.909> it<00:05:34.060> down<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.360> top

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
it collects oil and drips it down on top

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:50.340 
it collects oil and drips it down on top
of<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.750> valve

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.390 

and<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.470> want<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.650> make<00:05:51.800> sure<00:05:51.980> when<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.220> do

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
and you want to make sure when you do

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.300 
and you want to make sure when you do
tighten<00:05:52.760> these<00:05:52.880> up<00:05:52.940> that<00:05:53.390> you<00:05:53.890> don't<00:05:54.890> over

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
tighten these up that you don't over

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.950 
tighten these up that you don't over
tighten<00:05:55.460> them<00:05:55.700> in<00:05:55.850> yard<00:05:56.030> tightening<00:05:56.690> into

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
tighten them in yard tightening into

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.070 
tighten them in yard tightening into
aluminum<00:05:58.120> well<00:05:59.120> just<00:05:59.360> give<00:05:59.540> them<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.690> good<00:05:59.720> turn

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
aluminum well just give them a good turn

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.990 
aluminum well just give them a good turn
it<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:01.460> should<00:06:01.700> be<00:06:01.820> all<00:06:01.940> set

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.720 

so<00:06:05.540> anyways<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:06.230> do<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.220> same<00:06:07.430> on<00:06:07.610> the

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
so anyways you do the same on the

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.160 
so anyways you do the same on the
exhaust<00:06:08.060> side<00:06:08.300> I'm<00:06:08.630> not<00:06:08.780> going<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:08.990> show<00:06:09.110> you

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
exhaust side I'm not going to show you

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.420 
exhaust side I'm not going to show you
it<00:06:09.290> because<00:06:09.470> it's<00:06:09.620> harder<00:06:09.890> for<00:06:09.920> me<00:06:10.100> to<00:06:10.160> get<00:06:10.340> in

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
it because it's harder for me to get in

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.890 
it because it's harder for me to get in
there<00:06:10.610> with<00:06:10.700> the<00:06:10.790> angle<00:06:11.060> of<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.210> camera<00:06:11.630> and

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
there with the angle of the camera and

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.650 
there with the angle of the camera and
just<00:06:12.370> don't<00:06:13.370> have<00:06:13.550> to<00:06:13.700> readjust<00:06:13.940> your<00:06:14.330> timing

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
just don't have to readjust your timing

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.840 
just don't have to readjust your timing
just<00:06:14.930> check<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:15.830> maybe<00:06:16.010> before<00:06:16.220> just<00:06:16.610> to<00:06:16.700> make

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
just check it maybe before just to make

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.910 
just check it maybe before just to make
sure<00:06:17.000> your<00:06:17.120> marks<00:06:17.360> are<00:06:17.480> lined<00:06:17.660> up<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.080> then
