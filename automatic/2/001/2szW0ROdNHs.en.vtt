00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
different sizes of motherboards I have

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.650 
different sizes of motherboards I have
received<00:00:04.319> one<00:00:04.650> metric<00:00:05.220> but<00:00:05.520> ton<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.060> requests

to<00:00:06.810> cover<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.440> same<00:00:07.740> topic<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.120> computer

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
to cover the same topic but for computer

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.140 
to cover the same topic but for computer
cases<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.620> issue<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
cases the issue with this is that the

of a wide variety of configurations this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.340 
of a wide variety of configurations this
is<00:04:15.060> just<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> beginning<00:04:15.989> there's<00:04:16.139> other

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
is just the beginning there's other

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.379 
is just the beginning there's other
stuff<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.889> there<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:17.340> these<00:04:17.789> are<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.060> main

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
stuff out there but these are the main

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.940 
stuff out there but these are the main
ones<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.049> guess<00:04:19.289> that's<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.590> topic<00:04:19.799> for
