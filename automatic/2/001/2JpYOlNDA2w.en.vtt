00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.009
 in numbers and tupac and I know that commenting 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.680
 I bring you another episode of the guide 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.020
 of the coz you already know this name class of 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.610
 mentality but let's call it and good 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.590
 well here is some fierce with the k 12 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.750
 wild hair I will have a review 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.460
 of this weapon but look at the the 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.589
 start of maps was done all the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.849
 years in the back and a few 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.230
 they are going pills of how to start 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.789
 the maps that routes take and all that in 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.109
 domain because I only take a few 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.509
 how many routes to turn them around or 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.560
 to try to have the pro and the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.449
 truth is pretty good what I do 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.489
 good here the first ball already hit 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.320
 we started to stop not here, well, well, 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.270
 we are seeing that just when I finish 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.380
 to take the flag and all the years that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.640
 have killed well answered already and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.440
 they started going by then 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
 here face a little bit because I have to 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.220
 clicks but I start to see that they start 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 also to come them in a version of 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.940
 fx and such so what I do is catch e 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.520
 go to the left is worth to throw me 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.320
 of all of them and it also just coincides 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.580
 you will see that it hit me in the air with good 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.350
 follows us in the air or when I was 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.760
 here just going you see me here just me 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.350
 done with an uncle I turned came to what 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm going to ram red when you're red 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.200
 and the uncle is whole of life does not 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.280
 I ordered because you have to lose not 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 I'll see you again if you had to clean 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 but the comrades had killed there 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.220
 killing more and I escaped not then 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.780
 good today we are going to talk about the minimap 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 is an important action aspect perhaps 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.190
 it's more important in both for the theme 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 of clouds to you all that but I think that in 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.010
 this game is also very important 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.500
 because there are enough things that you should 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.810
 know then good here we are going to do 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.070
 another break we are not seeing that with him 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.300
 after I had shot I think that what 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.770
 I had thrown myself then with we are seeing 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.420
 that there was one in b then you will see that there is 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.500
 from another instead and we are seeing well that 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.030
 I have an enemy to the right many 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.530
 you will think you are young, you fucking, you have not done it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.820
 seen I do not prefer to kill first ones that are 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.080
 taking the flag so that we do not 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.240
 catch the flag and have control of 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.130
 map and like the one above has not seen me 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.890
 and a silencer so quickly I 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.330
 I charge those two and come back for this one later 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.220
 you will see m additionally surcharge others that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.900
 they are taking the flag I think even 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.820
 shot a corpse for free not there is 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.650
 traveled the first the second we killed 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.479
 this one that was crazy and is was a corpse 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.820
 just in case it does not get up and 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.920
 we are throwing the clouds sorry the war bird 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.509
 is one is a fierce truth that could 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.740
 been adn if I had played it a little bit 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.020
 more head but I each table with the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.550
 ferocious then I do not think about her for 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.740
 streak of adn that is already one will come with it 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.140
 but I am happy and in this climate is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.729
 quite with weapons and with gusts so 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 they could be close I do not know if you want 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.730
 count how many will be gun but I 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.950
 it's pretty close then 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.480
 the minimal theme in this game of the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.220
 bitch that is that there is no use as in the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.420
 whites 2 but we have several aspects 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.580
 important the first of them 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.450
 obviously it's 9 and the egg is 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 pretty special 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.190
 good 9 and when a guy shoots 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.540
 ok without silencer we can also 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.099
 put the parabolic microphone with the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.959
 logo but good when we see a guy in 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.030
 the minimum for there are a two forms 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.620
 ways to see it on the map the first one is 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.629
 that if it's on your same floor, that is if 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 is at your same level it will come out as a 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.230
 red dot if you see it and if it's in a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.579
 Higher or lower level to you will come out 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.840
 with a red dot and a little arrow and this 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.510
 you have to take into account why 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.549
 when we see 2.0 of mine practically every 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.440
 12 seconds continuously looking at the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.329
 minimal because it is very important and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.430
 does not use the baby as something of insurance 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.010
 because many people who wear the pse 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.910
 if it goes bad incognito not to not leave the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.099
 low profile are called this game I think 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.629
 to not get out on the minimap so 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.319
 after using it as an aid but not as 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.030
 safe 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.440
 you do not see then it goes country not to as there is no 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.579
 nobody here does not see more channels on the radar 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.040
 well there will not be anyone you do not have to have 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.629
 careful indeed see in action they ensure 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.250
 here for example medium without bullets I have 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.540
 have to walk around here doing a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.340
 little the fool looking for weapons by the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.319
 soil is I do not know that then you will see that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.370
 I entered by b and decided today to have 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.370
 shot but I decide to pay 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.170
 so good what I told you the minimum 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.820
 it's very important if you want more help 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.410
 with the minimap evidently the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.880
 Parabolic microphone is a worn out 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.380
 accessories because you are going to see all the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.300
 world that I shot you will see in the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.740
 map wear good muffler if not 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.930
 It has essence or rather obviously 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.950
 you are going to see the map always but if 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.870
 the silencer carries the only 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.340
 we can do is parabolic microphone and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.020
 it goes very well we have gone from my weapons that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.930
 For example the rx can be put 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.400
 the parabolic microphone the mp5 of the soul 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.870
 that makes 5 also goes very well with 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.730
 parabolic microphone the world with 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.709
 parabolic microphone of administrable not 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.350
 the accessory is not quite good 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.180
 you can see many people that you would not see 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.070
 normally and that helps a lot and 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.050
 then also because look at many in the 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.120
 hd not when in the partners in the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.770
 skulls and everything you do not have to look at 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.780
 everything so good here we were already in 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.910
 moment of tension maybe I was not 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.440
 near the streak had a 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.850
 helicopter in the air there I get to 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.020
 miss bullets like crazy and I say no then 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.970
 I'm getting nervous, let's go 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.730
 reassure yourself to calm down and talk 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.310
 also of the nerves sorry 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.870
 they affect a lot big play no and good 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.919
 because here you there is still no bullets and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.720
 here we are going to make a quite stop 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.430
 You do not see how I stopped him why 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.980
 if you are fixing me as always 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.020
 I say without looking at everything and it may seem 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.550
 a bullshit but if you have the wave of 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.690
 is the shadow of an uncle that's because 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.250
 well, because the day was jumping 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.720
 the wall then there I realized 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.270
 that even if you are not seeing on the radar or 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.530
 whatever it is in the mini map I gave myself 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.420
 account that the wall and the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.010
 astral that climbs on top of me or that 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.590
 between where I am then well then 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.910
 I'm going to review was going to check to see if 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.830
 I was where I was going to climb 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.240
 on top of my forgiveness we look for something a 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.190
 little bit outside I'm going to take a look 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.690
 up and hit me with the roof and I repeated 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.010
 forest comes into my house because it takes what 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.360
 he killed there is not a bit of luck because 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.070
 can go up and have lost it 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.240
 sight jump in front of you and as it would have 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.370
 killed do not have to be very careful 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.810
 very careful with those things so 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.280
 the kids remembered before 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.660
 finish the gameplay and tomorrow I'll be in a 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.910
 management tournament that speaks that in the 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.840
 s channel I think the boiler 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.180
 in the other one that is twitter 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.410
 black and I'll leave the link on twitter 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.550
 ok when they start the gesture 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.050
 I recommend that so we're going to spend a lot 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.610
 well I'll be many youtubers 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.160
 it's just a tournament a tournament for 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.380
 fans and good here comes out just the phenom 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.180
 so the kids said what 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.410
 I also go a little crazy could 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.540
 have followed the streak with weapons perhaps 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.070
 do not lower me your answer head you should not 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.960
 do this ever and less with a semi 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.550
 one on this map but good kids what 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.469
 saying 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.429
 I like favorites and get on for more 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.429
 goodbye 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.030
 yes 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.000
 and
