you'd ever want to think about doing in
your<00:00:15.660> vehicles<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.230> find<00:00:16.440> out<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.770> much

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
your vehicles to find out how much

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400 
your vehicles to find out how much

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
weight do you have in your vehicle how

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.849

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
bags in the trunk always know okay but

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.279 
bags in the trunk always know okay but
if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> did<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:27.300> added<00:00:27.900> weight<00:00:28.109> that's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
if you did there's added weight that's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.720 
if you did there's added weight that's
really<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.710> necessary<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.400> take<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
really not necessary you can take the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.420 
really not necessary you can take the
golf<00:00:29.880> bags<00:00:30.119> out<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.359> put<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> garage

difference<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.920> mileage<00:00:35.640> people<00:00:36.450> should

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
difference in mileage people should

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
difference in mileage people should
monitor<00:00:36.870> their<00:00:37.350> tire<00:00:37.559> pressures<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.550> often

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
monitor their tire pressures more often

than<00:00:39.180> they're<00:00:39.360> actually<00:00:39.660> saying<00:00:40.230> nowadays

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
than they're actually saying nowadays

than they're actually saying nowadays
and<00:00:41.040> coasting<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.559> easier<00:00:44.160> than

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and coasting is is so much easier than

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.200 
and coasting is is so much easier than
staying<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> throttle<00:00:46.070> momentum<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.940> your

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
staying on the throttle momentum is your

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
staying on the throttle momentum is your
friend<00:00:48.450> remember<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.930> momentum<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
friend remember that momentum that's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.080 
friend remember that momentum that's
what<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.129> gonna<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
what we're gonna use a lot here it's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.010 
what we're gonna use a lot here it's
momentum<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> apply<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> throttle

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
momentum when you apply the throttle

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.060 
momentum when you apply the throttle
imagine<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.289> placed<00:00:55.620> an<00:00:55.829> egg

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
imagine that if I've placed an egg

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.420 
imagine that if I've placed an egg
between<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.610> foot<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.600> throttle<00:00:57.870> pedal

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
between your foot and the throttle pedal

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.830 
between your foot and the throttle pedal
we<00:00:59.430> teach<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.120> driving<00:01:00.390> schools<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.809> teach

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
we teach in and driving schools we teach

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
we teach in and driving schools we teach
us<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.550> squeeze<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
us a lot so when you squeeze down on the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
us a lot so when you squeeze down on the
throttle<00:01:03.449> you're<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.110> slowly<00:01:04.680> squeezing

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
throttle you're just slowly squeezing

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
throttle you're just slowly squeezing
down<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.790> using<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> pressure

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
down you're not using a lot of pressure

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
down you're not using a lot of pressure
you're<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> gas<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.220> off<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> gas<00:01:08.610> on

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
you're not on the gas or off the gas on

the gas or off the gas
you<00:01:09.990> don't<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> break<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> egg<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.610> as

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you don't want to break the egg so as

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
you don't want to break the egg so as
you<00:01:12.030> apply<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> throttle<00:01:12.780> same<00:01:13.500> goes<00:01:13.680> for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
you apply the throttle same goes for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
you apply the throttle same goes for
braking<00:01:14.689> not<00:01:15.689> transferring<00:01:16.470> weight

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
do now all right put her in jog and roll

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
do now all right put her in jog and roll
on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> power<00:01:45.750> slowly<00:01:48.320> now<00:01:49.320> another<00:01:49.560> thing

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
on the power slowly now another thing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
on the power slowly now another thing
you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.420> shift<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you can do is you can you can shift the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
you can do is you can you can shift the
transmission<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.220> own<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.729> by

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
a red light right correct if we just

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.130 
a red light right correct if we just
slowly<00:02:25.280> throttle<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.060> down<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.450> road<00:02:26.480> here<00:02:26.989> I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
slowly throttle up down the road here I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.479 
slowly throttle up down the road here I
would<00:02:27.680> actually<00:02:27.950> lift<00:02:28.160> off<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> throttle

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
would actually lift off the throttle

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.910 
would actually lift off the throttle
right<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.390> coast<00:02:30.140> from<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.830> the

as we crest this hill look at the

as we crest this hill look at the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
momentum we could carry all the way to

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.710 
momentum we could carry all the way to
that<00:02:44.780> light<00:02:45.050> as<00:02:45.739> we<00:02:45.950> come<00:02:46.130> down<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.720> slightly

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that light as we come down so slightly

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.120 
that light as we come down so slightly
release<00:02:48.200> pressure<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.069> throttle<00:02:51.130> you're

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
release pressure on the throttle you're

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.100 
release pressure on the throttle you're
gonna<00:02:52.250> maintain<00:02:52.600> amazing<00:02:53.600> thing<00:02:53.780> as<00:02:53.959> you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
gonna maintain amazing thing as you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.380 
gonna maintain amazing thing as you
watch<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.459> maintain<00:02:55.640> your<00:02:55.910> speed<00:02:56.030> by

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
watch you can maintain your speed by

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.640 
watch you can maintain your speed by
just<00:02:56.600> adding<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.989> little<00:02:57.019> throttle<00:02:57.319> as<00:02:57.560> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
just adding a little throttle as you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.440 
just adding a little throttle as you
need<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:57.950> you'll<00:02:58.610> watch<00:02:58.819> that<00:02:59.090> once<00:02:59.330> you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
need it you'll watch that once you

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.720 
need it you'll watch that once you
release<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.840> throttle<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:01.250> really<00:03:01.519> don't

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
release the throttle you really don't

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.870 
release the throttle you really don't
lose<00:03:01.910> that<00:03:02.120> much<00:03:02.330> miles<00:03:02.780> per<00:03:03.140> hour<00:03:03.880> depending

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
lose that much miles per hour depending

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.110 
lose that much miles per hour depending
on<00:03:05.120> obviously<00:03:05.360> your<00:03:06.110> great<00:03:06.760> see<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.910> light's

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
on obviously your great see that light's

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120 
on obviously your great see that light's
changed<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.049> red<00:03:09.260> somewhere<00:03:09.709> no<00:03:09.920> hurry

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
changed so it's red somewhere no hurry

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.550 
changed so it's red somewhere no hurry
so<00:03:10.459> we've<00:03:10.610> thought<00:03:11.060> ahead<00:03:11.390> we're<00:03:11.600> we're<00:03:12.170> we're

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
so we've thought ahead we're we're we're

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.190 
so we've thought ahead we're we're we're
ahead<00:03:12.680> of<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> game<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.540> we<00:03:14.630> might<00:03:14.810> even<00:03:15.019> be

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
ahead of the game and we might even be

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900 
ahead of the game and we might even be
able<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> use<00:03:15.590> our<00:03:15.739> momentum<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.430> go<00:03:16.549> around

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
able to use our momentum to go around

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:27.460 
able to use our momentum to go around
this<00:03:17.150> right-hander<00:03:18.019> here

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.470 

what<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.740> car<00:03:29.090> sitting<00:03:30.090> at<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.270> light

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
what is that car sitting at that light

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.260 
what is that car sitting at that light
gonna<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.900> see<00:03:31.260> he<00:03:31.440> wants<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.740> turn<00:03:31.920> left<00:03:32.270> if

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
gonna do see he wants to turn left if

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.730 
gonna do see he wants to turn left if
I've<00:03:33.510> got<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> car<00:03:33.960> in<00:03:34.110> front<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.440> me<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.680> I'm

the<00:04:00.570> weight<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.930> vehicle<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.470> in<00:04:01.620> one

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
the weight of the vehicle then in one

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.540 
the weight of the vehicle then in one
way<00:04:01.890> or<00:04:01.920> another<00:04:03.050> and<00:04:04.050> let's<00:04:04.230> get<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.560> 50<00:04:04.950> 55

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
way or another and let's get up to 50 55

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.160 
way or another and let's get up to 50 55
miles<00:04:05.790> an<00:04:05.880> hour<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:09.120> faster<00:04:09.570> we<00:04:09.690> get<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.930> going

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
miles an hour the faster we get it going

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.510 
miles an hour the faster we get it going
initially<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.709> momentum<00:04:11.100> we're<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.430> be

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
initially the momentum we're going to be

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.430 
initially the momentum we're going to be
able<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.760> carry<00:04:13.400> okay<00:04:14.400> now<00:04:14.550> lift

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.159 

just<00:04:17.769> maintain<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.430> right<00:04:18.670> there

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.830 

so<00:04:22.710> your<00:04:23.129> throttle<00:04:23.639> application<00:04:24.060> right<00:04:24.719> now

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
so your throttle application right now

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.209 
so your throttle application right now
is<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:24.990> minimal<00:04:25.620> isn't<00:04:26.129> it<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.919> we're<00:04:29.069> going

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
is very minimal isn't it and we're going

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:34.740 
is very minimal isn't it and we're going
to<00:04:29.280> spilling<00:04:29.840> 50<00:04:30.840> yeah

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.630 

squeeze<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> little<00:04:35.950> get<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> hill

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
squeeze a little get you up the hill

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.310 
squeeze a little get you up the hill
once<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.480> get<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.780> top<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.140> hill

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
once you get to the top of the hill

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.210 
once you get to the top of the hill
release<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.280> pressure<00:04:40.380> lift<00:04:41.380> it<00:04:41.500> off

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.800 

and<00:04:45.310> then<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.180> little<00:04:46.210> bit<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.600> throttle

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
and then just a little bit of throttle

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.960 
and then just a little bit of throttle
as<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.860> come<00:04:48.040> out

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.600 

I've<00:04:53.480> asked<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> lot<00:04:53.930> of<00:04:54.080> times<00:04:54.200> we'll<00:04:54.620> lift<00:04:55.430> off

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
I've asked a lot of times we'll lift off

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.210 
I've asked a lot of times we'll lift off
with<00:04:55.760> while<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.270> let<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:56.740> Coast<00:04:57.740> until<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
with while and let it Coast until I

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
with while and let it Coast until I
start<00:04:58.580> seeing<00:04:58.910> my<00:04:59.780> speed<00:05:00.580> come<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.790> drop<00:05:02.060> down

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
start seeing my speed come to drop down

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.220 
start seeing my speed come to drop down
a<00:05:02.300> little<00:05:02.690> bit<00:05:02.810> then<00:05:02.990> I'll<00:05:03.110> start<00:05:03.350> flying

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.990 

there's<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.920> fuel<00:05:11.310> burner<00:05:11.580> boy<00:05:12.480> yeah<00:05:14.000> nineteen

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
there's a fuel burner boy yeah nineteen

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.530 
there's a fuel burner boy yeah nineteen
nine<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.800> what<00:05:16.980> was<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.280> first<00:05:17.430> time<00:05:17.670> 18<00:05:18.240> -

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
nine and what was the first time 18 -

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.320 
nine and what was the first time 18 -
geez<00:05:21.560> pretty<00:05:22.560> good<00:05:22.680> improvement<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.210> can

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
geez pretty good improvement so you can

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.750 
geez pretty good improvement so you can
see<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.770> don't<00:05:25.980> think<00:05:26.160> we've<00:05:26.310> spent<00:05:26.520> more

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
see and I don't think we've spent more

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.040 
see and I don't think we've spent more
than<00:05:26.820> five<00:05:27.270> minutes<00:05:27.660> more<00:05:27.810> on<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.110> drive<00:05:28.320> I

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
than five minutes more on the drive I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.270 
than five minutes more on the drive I
didn't<00:05:31.050> have<00:05:31.170> a<00:05:31.200> stopwatch<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.950> but<00:05:32.130> I

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
didn't have a stopwatch on it but I

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.230 
didn't have a stopwatch on it but I
believe<00:05:32.670> that's<00:05:32.820> that's<00:05:33.810> pretty<00:05:33.990> good
