00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello, youtube, this is Paul. 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.840
 I'll be a modelista from now on 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 giving a lesson on how to model the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.600
 a scholarship in the future you will learn to 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.039
 model a bag like this 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.380
 Let's start with basic course in this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.219
 the basic course the necessary material 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:42.149
 You need 15 to cut the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:46.309
 pieces of a knife a compass a 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.430
 pencil and a ruler 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.239
 then in this basic course come back 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.579
 teaching you first to summon 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.039
 the material as I came to the cardboard 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 let's see that here we have a template that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.700
 ten in width and 15 in height and has 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.549
 right rounded corners teaching 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.909
 in this first class how to make the mold 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.310
 of plaster 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 Let's see that this card is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 totally crooked as we'll put it in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 that cardboard box is teaching 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.900
 for you guys 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.159
 the first measure we need is 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.990
 of 10 little 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:40.159
 So let's see you get a ruler. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:45.000
 and your knife will go vertical 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.200
 without cutting soft paper only 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 to make the crease in the made cardboard 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.090
 bond 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090
 you will fold 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.930
 folding the paper we always go 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 work with cardboard and crease 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 face down 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.360
 when you see the cardboard down 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.660
 You'll get your knife and give it a 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 cut for us to find our first 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.709
 measure 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.480
 You're going to cut a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.130
 when you go down cut the other side 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.519
 The other cut will come out. 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:39.190
 You will open the cardboard, will you? 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:44.440
 pick up the ruler and it will cut when you 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 automatically cut by 6/4 and 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:54.340
 this side see that it was perfect 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:57.220
 she was in this way and stayed 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.170
 we have the affected part here we have 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.769
 the parts of straight down 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.870
 So let's find our first move. 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:08.079
 that we want to nickname as the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.180
 ready made mold 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.440
 how close it is 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 just as it is already closed 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.079
 our model so it stays the same 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.780
 that's what we're going to do 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:26.520
 we need to find the measure of 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:33.120
 15 that the chem is from this bridge 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.030
 the point you will get the ruler goes 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:44.870
 put this side that's already squadron and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.870
 already gives until the 15 will make a cut 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.010
 the cut has to appear on the other side 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.470
 only a very small cut that when 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.690
 you open the cardboard 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.440
 the cut will be on the other side will 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 to be both sides 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.590
 You'll get the ruler and you'll cut it. 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.860
 let's see that we already have our mother 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.860
 our height of 15 knots we already have our 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.190
 Height only missing We now find our 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:23.260
 width our width we want is 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:28.420
 with the material is creased to the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.800
 Meanwhile we'll post from here until 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.800
 five centimeters 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:44.490
 we will put 5cm open will stand some 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.490
 10 centimeters what we need is 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.260
 made cut open cardboard 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.200
 we now have ten centimeters and the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.280
 15 tall we will make the corner 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.710
 rounded 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.260
 I will explain to you how we 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.730
 we will use to make that rounded corner 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.500
 we will use the compass in this compass 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.550
 let's make a curve more or less 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.470
 this big 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.440
 here I've used about 12 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.250
 centimeters of curve so I'll pick up 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.110
 the compass 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.490
 I'll open it up to two centimeters 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.760
 those two centimeters 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:33.220
 I'll go to modeling and I'll put it on 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.820
 tip of the modeling and did flee 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.120
 Marking comes here and turning from this side 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.880
 I made another scoring alone I go to the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.400
 Marking I did spin 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:50.400
 I go to the other side I did the other one. 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.790
 marking and spin in this spin 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.930
 it was marked here 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:01.910
 and in the middle of the two you put spin 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.580
 compass 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:10.430
 let's see that here is forming a curve 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:15.560
 look at this curve you fold in the middle 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:20.290
 your model and cut the rounded 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.180
 when you cut a fold in the middle 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.790
 will automatically exit the other side 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:31.730
 We always work how to work. 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:33.160
 with model comes golden cadu like 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.400
 this first class 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.890
 press then clicks that we liked 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.850
 as soon as possible giving one more 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:46.930
 A lesson for you, thank you very much.
