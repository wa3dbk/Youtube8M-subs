00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.650
 decision 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.650
 even 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.190
 very beautiful 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.260
 because success sat 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.430
 nice to be a big part when 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.170
 creating 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.920
 at the first international competition

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.120
 hammer-on on 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.240
 at least probably always apply 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.760
 dress suppression 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.550
 ugly hijal because the material 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.030
 very beautiful and practical it is not 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 spoiled dress at hand is changing 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.080
 any build and 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.620
 here we can observe and unique 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.630
 it allows opens a huge scope 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.070
 for creativity orite every girl 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.430
 must be creative 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.109
 This we also pay you can bring 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:23.250
 millions on a great way therefore 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.500
 girls highly recommend being braided 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.800
 new money 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.800
 mena 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.570
 yes here I completely agree not they 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.600
 barking changing just one element of decoration 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.690
 stylist, image maker Kashleva Lyudmila 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 created a new image and each image was 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.480
 unique you know i noticed 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.070
 on the fact that 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.650
 Lyudmila very actively used 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.230
 invisible pins and it allowed 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.110
 attach jewelry in the hair where 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.360
 it was necessary for her, you know, it seemed to me 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.810
 it is very convenient 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.240
 in general it is certainly cool, I totally 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.840
 differently looked at the possibility of them 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.900
 Amiran 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.629
 and I think that I will develop this topic in 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.330
 the future if you enjoyed our video
