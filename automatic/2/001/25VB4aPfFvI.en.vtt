if I'm wrong number one scroll in the
same<00:01:05.430> easy<00:01:06.090> nice<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.390> loose<00:01:06.659> okay<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
same easy nice and loose okay then if I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
same easy nice and loose okay then if I
put<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> third<00:01:08.430> setting<00:01:08.670> ok<00:01:09.030> click<00:01:09.439> OK

it's going to be a hard click so the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's going to be a hard click so the
hard<00:01:12.479> clicks<00:01:12.689> probably<00:01:12.930> better<00:01:13.080> suits

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hard clicks probably better suits

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
hard clicks probably better suits

that<00:04:47.780> flexible<00:04:48.200> but<00:04:48.800> apart<00:04:49.010> from<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:49.190> I

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
that flexible but apart from that I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.940 
that flexible but apart from that I
think<00:04:49.460> there's<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.610> really<00:04:49.820> good<00:04:50.030> Mouse<00:04:50.240> it's

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950

think there's a really good Mouse it's
not<00:04:51.950> exactly<00:04:52.250> sure<00:04:52.340> how<00:04:52.580> much<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.970> is<00:04:53.000> have<00:04:53.210> to

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
not exactly sure how much it is have to

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.150 
not exactly sure how much it is have to
look<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.540> up<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.750> put<00:04:53.900> in<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.050> description
