mucus<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:44.070> entirely<00:01:44.939> sure<00:01:45.149> what<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.600> for

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mucus not entirely sure what that's for

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.130

I<00:01:45.960> haven't<00:01:46.290> seen<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> only<00:01:46.829> schematic<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
I haven't seen that only schematic so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
I haven't seen that only schematic so
we'll<00:01:49.140> leave<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.680> possibly<00:01:49.829> send<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
we'll leave that and possibly send it to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.670 
we'll leave that and possibly send it to
the<00:01:50.460> lab<00:01:50.700> later<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.470> from

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the lab later but as you can see from

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.819 
the lab later but as you can see from
the<00:01:52.860> inside<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.899> really<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.649> there's

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the inside there really you know there's

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.380 
the inside there really you know there's
not<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.280> overheating<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.240> on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
not gonna be much overheating going on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
not gonna be much overheating going on
there's<00:01:57.600> still<00:01:57.750> got<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> large<00:01:58.200> fans<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there's still got the large fans at the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.670 
there's still got the large fans at the
back<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.659> much<00:02:00.899> smaller<00:02:01.229> footprint

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
back but you know much smaller footprint

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.750 
back but you know much smaller footprint
should<00:02:01.799> hopefully<00:02:02.130> produce<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.790> lot<00:02:03.060> less<00:02:03.329> heat

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
should hopefully produce a lot less heat
