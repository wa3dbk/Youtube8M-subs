you've managed to hit them there's also

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.659 
you've managed to hit them there's also
still<00:01:55.529> the<00:01:55.649> one<00:01:55.770> per<00:01:55.950> fruit<00:01:56.189> why<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.459> you<00:01:56.549> get

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:56.669 
still the one per fruit why if you get

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:58.039 
still the one per fruit why if you get
100<00:01:56.819> of<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.239> you'll<00:01:57.389> get<00:01:57.539> an<00:01:57.630> extra<00:01:57.899> like

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
100 of them you'll get an extra like

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.419 
100 of them you'll get an extra like
this<00:01:58.349> still<00:01:58.529> the<00:01:58.590> masks<00:01:59.069> while<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.279> can

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
this still the masks while they can

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.709 
this still the masks while they can
protect<00:01:59.669> you<00:02:00.029> they<00:02:00.149> can<00:02:00.270> give<00:02:00.389> you<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> limited

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
protect you they can give you a limited

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.510 
protect you they can give you a limited
invincibility<00:02:01.169> and<00:02:01.590> i'm<00:02:01.979> pretty<00:02:02.219> sure<00:02:02.369> on

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
invincibility and i'm pretty sure on

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.519 
invincibility and i'm pretty sure on
this<00:02:02.609> one<00:02:02.669> I<00:02:02.849> can<00:02:02.999> also<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.630> dark<00:02:03.899> area<00:02:04.259> if

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
this one I can also like up dark area if

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:06.859 
this one I can also like up dark area if
you<00:02:04.559> get<00:02:04.799> enough<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.099> them<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.719> really

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
you get enough of them so not really

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
you get enough of them so not really
much<00:02:07.079> different<00:02:07.139> little<00:02:07.619> platforming<00:02:08.039> levels

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
much different little platforming levels

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
much different little platforming levels
of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.489> game<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> also<00:02:08.940> let's<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
of the game and also let's get on to the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.990 
of the game and also let's get on to the
air

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
air

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.070 
air
different<00:02:11.390> levels<00:02:11.630> actually<00:02:11.750> show<00:02:12.050> up

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
different levels actually show up

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.050 
different levels actually show up
however<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.710> have<00:02:12.740> this<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.520> something<00:02:13.940> that's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
however we have this is something that's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.300 
however we have this is something that's
slightly<00:02:14.360> different<00:02:14.900> its<00:02:15.020> air<00:02:15.250> killing<00:02:16.250> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
slightly different its air killing a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.650 
slightly different its air killing a
bunch<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.610> enemies<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.060> pit<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.300> order

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
bunch of enemies in a pit in order

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.720 
bunch of enemies in a pit in order
active<00:02:18.290> eh<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.830> wave<00:02:19.010> forward<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.610> for

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
active eh the wave forward so for

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.850 
active eh the wave forward so for
example<00:02:19.790> there<00:02:20.210> give<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.570> jump<00:02:20.810> pad<00:02:21.020> little

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
example there give you a jump pad little

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.380 
example there give you a jump pad little
things<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.370> I've<00:02:22.640> changed<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.300> I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
things like that I've changed but as I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.790 
things like that I've changed but as I
said<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:23.690> nothing<00:02:23.840> really<00:02:24.020> dramatic<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.740> if

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
said it's nothing really dramatic so if

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.590 
said it's nothing really dramatic so if
you<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.220> first<00:02:25.430> one<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.090> second<00:02:26.480> one's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
you like the first one the second one's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.330 
you like the first one the second one's
much<00:02:26.840> better<00:02:27.110> allows<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.770> see<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
much better allows you to see if and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.980 
much better allows you to see if and
it's<00:02:28.459> well<00:02:28.610> worth<00:02:28.790> taking<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.150> look<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.780> this

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
it's well worth taking a look but this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.390 
it's well worth taking a look but this
is<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> ball<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.500> levels<00:02:33.800> are<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.100> like<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
is the ball the levels are just like the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.310 
is the ball the levels are just like the
world<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> last<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.180> basically<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.900> unable

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
world the last one basically you unable

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.230 
world the last one basically you unable
to<00:02:36.560> see<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:36.920> front<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:37.880> you've<00:02:38.000> got<00:02:38.060> to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
to see in front of you so you've got to

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.850 
to see in front of you so you've got to
avoid<00:02:38.480> obstacles<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:39.140> best<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.500> while

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
avoid obstacles as best you can while

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.920 
avoid obstacles as best you can while
also<00:02:40.100> avoiding<00:02:40.340> getting<00:02:40.700> crushed<00:02:41.060> every<00:02:41.810> now

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
also avoiding getting crushed every now

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.210 
also avoiding getting crushed every now
and<00:02:42.080> then<00:02:42.170> will<00:02:42.320> be<00:02:42.380> sections<00:02:42.800> while<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.040> ball

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and then will be sections while the ball

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.860 
and then will be sections while the ball
that<00:02:43.370> doesn't<00:02:43.670> cheers<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:44.180> which<00:02:44.330> really

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
that doesn't cheers here which really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.960 
that doesn't cheers here which really
helps<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.290> out<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.650> takes<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.250> bit<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
helps you out and it takes a bit of the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.120 
helps you out and it takes a bit of the
air<00:02:47.090> pressure<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.510> things<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.010> fair

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
air pressure of things and to be fair

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.830 
air pressure of things and to be fair
the<00:02:49.310> ability<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:49.910> slides<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> things<00:02:50.720> like

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
the ability to do slides and things like

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.630 
the ability to do slides and things like
that<00:02:50.900> now<00:02:51.260> does<00:02:51.650> actually<00:02:51.890> really<00:02:52.310> help<00:02:52.489> on

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
that now does actually really help on

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
playing is pure with a tiger but that's

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.640 
playing is pure with a tiger but that's
