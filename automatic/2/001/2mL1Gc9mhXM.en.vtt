 favorites that you know me 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.760
 they like dark lipsticks very much and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.010
 I like neutral shadows a lot, I do not know 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.870
 very colorful in the sense of playing with 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.730
 green and blue shadows but nevertheless 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.830
 sometimes I do it to make videos of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
 you absolutely all the students 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.820

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.489

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.950

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.990

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.619
 The first thing we are going to do is apply 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.900
 a makeup first and then the base 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.380
 a little bit dark out there blurs everything 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 very very well 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.260
 I like to seal my makeup with a 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.740
 loose powder in this case I use the banana 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.500

 mark the edge and then fill the 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.050
 empty spaces doing as if 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.720

 with a brush to blur I'll 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.180
 add fresh to go giving it dimension 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.950
 to my face and depth 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.699
 one side to the other but in the basin 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.739
 of our eyes we will try not to 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.599
 move so much towards what is the 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:45.650

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.220

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.990
 towards what is the lacrimal but in the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.900
 back and I'm going to blur 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.390
 this to then go back to the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.130
 color with which we begin and return to 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.620
 touch up that part so that he leaves 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.450
 seeing the difference and so that it continues 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.310
 very well lit we turn to the color 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.680

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.150
 dark of the palette and let's go with a 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.820

 bringing it forward a little 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.210
 but always with gentle movements 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.600
 soft so it fades 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.060
