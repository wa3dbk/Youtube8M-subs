 so well all the gifts for the little ones I 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.380
 bought left to think of something to give 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.679
 older guys 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 but I would suggest something 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 entertaining but what fails 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.210
 in few days 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.650
 for example board games you can 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 play all holidays 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 Yes, I also thought about it and therefore 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 chose mystery is very beautiful 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.610
 board game you need to calm 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.600
 poltergeist who settled in old 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 mansion one player becomes 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 poltergeist rest 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 psychics using dream cards 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 ghost tells of events 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 happening in this old dark house 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.239
 and the essence of the game is to find 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 criminal ghost free listen 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.350
 I like the mysterious game 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.530
 teenagers will love it and have 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.070
 for children and adults 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.320
 the essence is very simple from the card on which 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.560
 written words need these words 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.110
 to draw a song to the music 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 gestures smoothly to the word was 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 know 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.890
 240 game cards will be enough for a very 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.610
 long turn but if you want 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.549
 some kind of irrepressible fun then 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
