first tip might sound kind of weird but

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
first tip might sound kind of weird but
it<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.730> simply<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> clean<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:33.989> wardrobe

and<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.160> reason<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.489> say<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.090> because

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and the reason I say this is because

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.080 
and the reason I say this is because
personally<00:00:37.020> mine<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.040> small<00:00:38.460> everything

personally mine is so small everything

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
personally mine is so small everything
is<00:00:39.210> jam-packed<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.710> things<00:00:40.980> are

easily misplaced and I totally forget I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
easily misplaced and I totally forget I
even<00:00:43.469> had<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.820> cleaned<00:00:45.149> everything

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
across the interwebs I do have my own

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
across the interwebs I do have my own
DIY<00:01:19.530> video<00:01:20.070> coming<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.180> soon

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
DIY video coming up really really soon

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
DIY video coming up really really soon
with<00:01:21.450> some<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.619> pretty<00:01:22.860> unique<00:01:23.369> ideas

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
with some I think pretty unique ideas

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
with some I think pretty unique ideas
for<00:01:24.150> DIY<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.259> keep<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.619> eye<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
for DIY so do keep an eye out for that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
for DIY so do keep an eye out for that
but<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.140> way

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
but I just think that that's a good way

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
but I just think that that's a good way
to<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.310> even<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> do

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to go about it because even if you do

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
to go about it because even if you do
stuff<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.619> no<00:01:31.829> big<00:01:32.070> loss<00:01:32.280> because

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stuff out then it's no big loss because

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.859 
stuff out then it's no big loss because
you're<00:01:32.759> probably<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> throw<00:01:33.630> those

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you're probably going to throw those

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
to try out the trend or maybe it's just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.050 
to try out the trend or maybe it's just
a<00:02:53.290> trend<00:02:53.530> you're<00:02:53.769> not<00:02:54.069> sure<00:02:54.400> would<00:02:54.640> suit<00:02:54.910> you

but you still want to experiment with it
I<00:02:57.010> would<00:02:57.430> definitely<00:02:57.640> try<00:02:58.299> and<00:02:58.690> find<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
I would definitely try and find the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.500 
I would definitely try and find the
trend<00:03:00.099> through<00:03:00.340> accessories<00:03:01.030> instead

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
trend through accessories instead

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.420 
trend through accessories instead
because<00:03:01.870> usually<00:03:02.080> an<00:03:02.500> accessory<00:03:03.130> if<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.340> go

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
because usually an accessory if you go

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.910 
because usually an accessory if you go
to<00:03:03.489> get<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.880> belt<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.510> hat<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.230> necklace<00:03:05.859> a

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.020 
really think - again that much wear out
of<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.440> I<00:06:25.650> think<00:06:25.950> that's<00:06:26.130> really<00:06:26.730> really

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030
