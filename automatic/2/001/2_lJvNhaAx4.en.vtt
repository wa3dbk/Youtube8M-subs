00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.780
 now we meet the doctor 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.719
 Andrey Amaya, who is going to talk about the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.100
 diabetic retinopathy doctor tell us 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.630
 please what is retinopathy 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:23.490
 diabetic diabetic retinopathy is the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 manifestation of diabetes in the eyes 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.420
 Every diabetic is at risk of suffering 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.330
 Diabetic retinopathy in its first 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 stages this condition barely presents 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.390
 visual symptoms but without detection 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.880
 and an early treatment is can harm 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 permanently the retina 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.980
 if it is not detected early this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 condition can produce symptoms that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.630
 affect the view as a slight 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.810
 delinquency of near vision or 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.520
 away the image of floating bodies and 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.760
 even the sudden loss of the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.070
 view 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.320
 if it is not handled properly it can 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.550
 cause serious loss of vision and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.890
 even blindness 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 the eye surgeon can not reverse the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360
 damage caused by retinopathy 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 diabetic but if the condition is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 detect in time there are treatments 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.560
 modern ones that can help stop your 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.190
 advance and prevent further loss of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.280
 the view 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.430
 It is essential that diabetics 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.490
 submit to periodic exams and even 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.040
 If you have not yet noticed any symptoms if 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.770
 a patient observes any change 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.620
 important in his vision he must come from 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 immediately to the ophthalmologist even if 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.020
 He has received a test recently 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.950
 what types of diabetic retinopathy 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.110
 there are doctor there are two types of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.630
 diabetic retinopathy retinopathy 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.010
 non- proliferative diabetic and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.010
 Proliferative diabetic retinopathy 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.690
 as just mentioned one of the 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.180
 forms of diabetic retinopathy is the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.929
 non-proliferation or also called rdnp 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.480
 Proliferative diabetic retinopathy 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.630
 occurs when diabetes or high 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.190
 content of sugar in the blood damages 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.770
 the small blood vessels of the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.990
 retina that start losing fluid and 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.730
 blood with which the retina goes 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.400
 swelling or swelling 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.799
 over time the swelling or edema of the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 Retina thickens the retina and returns 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.700
 blurred vision 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.799
 the other type of diabetic retinopathy 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.060
 is diabetic retinopathy 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.319
 proliferative or erp 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.019
 this happens when some glasses 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.260
 new and fragile grow in a normal way 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.500
 coming out of the retina and penetrating the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.190
 vitreous humor 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 this can cause intraocular bleeding 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.150
 scars on the retina 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.150
 and contraction of the vitreous humor 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.830
 which in turn can cause a 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.010
 detachment of the retina 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.470
 Proliferative diabetic retinopathy 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.050
 It can cause vision problems 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.690
 and even reaching blindness is 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.340
 should treat as soon as possible 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.110
 Now let's see what are the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.910
 treatments for retinopathy 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.340
 diabetic tell us doctor 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.040
 in most cases of retinopathy 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.350
 non-proliferative diabetic the best 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.510
 treatment is proper control of the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.030
 diabetes and sugar figures 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.770
 half of a doctor's care 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.200
 expert endocrinologist in diabetes 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.860
 an option to treat mild cases 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.920
 of proliferative diabetic retinopathy 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.530
 is the bread retinal photocoagulation by 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.230
 middle of the sre 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.410
 with a laser the doctor treats the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.850
 periphery of the retina where the changes 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.850
 due to diabetes are found 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.470
 the macula that is responsible for the greatest 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.900
 part of our vision especially the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.110
 central vision is not treated with the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.170
 To be 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.480
 the procedure causes contraction 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.850
 and the healing of the vessels 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.700
 abnormal blood and prevents the 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.800
 growth of new vessels however 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.310
 it may be necessary more than one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.600
 application of the treatment 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.700
 after the procedure 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.340
 lateral vision can decrease a 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.180
 little and can also be reduced slightly 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.180
 night vision 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.400
 it is possible that the central vision is 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.490
 blurred for a few weeks but 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.889
 this always improves you have to remember that 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.930
 Diabetes continues to affect vision and 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.790
 if it is not treated in a timely manner it can 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.310
 cause blindness 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.440
 It is important to periodically go to 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.080
 ophthalmologist 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.540
 with early detection and with the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.880
 Modern Treatment Options 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.700
 threat of loss of vision by 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.830
 Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.830
 today much smaller than before 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.710
 for moderate cases of retinopathy 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.320
 proliferative diabetic we use the 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.550
 antiangiogenic therapy by means of 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.550
 intravitreal injections 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.670
 these new therapies act 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.860
 directly on the retina and help 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.100
 improve intraocular bleeds 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.590
 and to adequately resolve the 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.450
 swelling or edema of the retina that is the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.320
 main cause of visual loss 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.320
 in these patients 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.160
 this translates into visual improvement 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.160
 by the patient 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.480
 for severe cases of retinopathy 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.580
 proliferative diabetic 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.220
 in which there are hemorrhages within the 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.210
 eye and retinal detachment 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.030
 we perform a procedure called 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.010
 vitrectomy in which by means of a 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.610
 small device we remove the humor 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.520
 glass 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.289
 and we replace it with water or gas this 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.150
 causes the patient to recover his vision 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.379
 when removing the bleeding and re-applying 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.379
 again the retina 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.250
 I am elvira martínez garcía I am 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:30.730
 diabetic was completely blind 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:34.420
 I came here in the service they operated on me 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:38.110
 cataracts and effusions and thanks to the doctor 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:43.620
 Bejarano, I see, I'm very happy with 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.620
 the hospital thanks to him I'm seeing
