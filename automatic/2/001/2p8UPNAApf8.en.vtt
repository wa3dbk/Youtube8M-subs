automotive<00:00:24.890> work<00:00:25.039> is<00:00:25.220> considered<00:00:25.730> starting

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:26.149 
automotive work is considered starting

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.029 
automotive work is considered starting
to<00:00:26.210> be<00:00:26.269> considered<00:00:26.660> art<00:00:27.019> work<00:00:27.199> now<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.679> I

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
to be considered art work now and I

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.979 
to be considered art work now and I
don't<00:00:28.219> know<00:00:28.309> that<00:00:28.519> that<00:00:28.699> was<00:00:28.910> true<00:00:29.269> many<00:00:29.779> years

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
don't know that that was true many years

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.170 
don't know that that was true many years
ago<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.410> it<00:00:30.829> could<00:00:31.009> be<00:00:31.160> maybe<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:31.730> only<00:00:31.880> new

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
ago and it could be maybe the only new

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.750 
ago and it could be maybe the only new
form<00:00:32.719> of<00:00:32.870> art<00:00:33.110> there<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:33.769> this<00:00:33.920> last

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
form of art there is in this last

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.000 
form of art there is in this last
century<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.120> don't<00:00:35.360> know<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:35.899> now<00:00:36.500> there's<00:00:36.829> an

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
century I don't know so now there's an

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.619 
century I don't know so now there's an
interest<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:37.399> handmade<00:00:37.729> things<00:00:38.089> and<00:00:38.329> whether

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
interest in handmade things and whether

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.290 
interest in handmade things and whether
it<00:00:38.750> be<00:00:38.870> leather<00:00:39.079> craft<00:00:39.530> or<00:00:39.920> clothing<00:00:40.729> or

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it be leather craft or clothing or

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.869 
it be leather craft or clothing or
automobiles<00:00:41.930> or<00:00:42.409> yachts<00:00:42.920> or<00:00:43.250> whatever<00:00:43.579> so

automobiles or yachts or whatever so
right<00:00:44.120> now<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.750> think<00:00:45.079> there's<00:00:45.589> a<00:00:45.649> lot<00:00:45.890> of

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
right now I think there's a lot of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.950 
right now I think there's a lot of
interest<00:00:46.460> on<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.820> craftsman<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.479> things

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
interest on the craftsman and things

they get a lot of satisfaction out of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.200 
they get a lot of satisfaction out of
driving<00:01:30.050> something<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:31.070> work<00:01:31.220> hard<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
driving something that you work hard to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:55.399 
driving something that you work hard to
create

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.779 

based<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.340> 57<00:01:57.560> 1957<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:58.799> pretty<00:01:59.159> modern<00:01:59.640> in

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
based on 57 1957 still pretty modern in

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.109 
based on 57 1957 still pretty modern in
the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.149> gonna<00:02:00.270> function<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.939> course

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the way it's gonna function so of course

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.670 
the way it's gonna function so of course
it<00:02:03.539> has<00:02:03.720> power<00:02:03.840> steering<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.500> air

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
it has power steering and air

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200 
it has power steering and air
conditioning<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.729> stuff<00:02:05.939> but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
conditioning and that kind of stuff but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.219 
conditioning and that kind of stuff but
it's<00:02:06.689> also<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.110> brute<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.160> real<00:02:08.399> brute<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
it's also a brute it's a real brute so I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's also a brute it's a real brute so I
think<00:02:10.470> there's<00:02:10.769> kind<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.130> appropriate<00:02:11.550> for

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
think there's kind of appropriate for

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580 
think there's kind of appropriate for
this<00:02:11.819> car<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.180> car<00:02:12.239> has<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> lot<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> substance

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
this car this car has a lot of substance

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.809 
this car this car has a lot of substance
to<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.680> got<00:02:16.860> muscle<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.640> its

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
to it and it it's it's got muscle so its

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:43.020 
to it and it it's it's got muscle so its
engine<00:02:18.180> needed<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.569> little<00:02:18.780> muscle<00:02:18.989> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.390 

we<00:02:44.030> want<00:02:44.299> our<00:02:44.560> reservoir<00:02:45.560> power<00:02:46.040> steering

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
we want our reservoir power steering

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.699 
we want our reservoir power steering
reservoir<00:02:46.549> cap<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> cap<00:02:48.260> that's<00:02:48.500> like

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
reservoir cap to have a cap that's like

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.789 
reservoir cap to have a cap that's like
this<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.780> could<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:51.019> smaller<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:51.650> it

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
this and it could be smaller but it

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.800 
this and it could be smaller but it
should<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.370> same<00:02:52.640> design<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.689> it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
should have the same design and so it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.630 
should have the same design and so it
looks<00:02:53.989> like<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.140> Ferrari<00:02:54.409> part<00:02:54.890> maybe<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
looks like a Ferrari part maybe the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.250 
looks like a Ferrari part maybe the
finish<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.150> black<00:02:56.390> wrinkled<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.049> cam

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
finish is black wrinkled like the cam

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:27.700 
finish is black wrinkled like the cam
covers

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.550 

but<00:03:28.710> I<00:03:28.890> don't<00:03:29.610> know<00:03:29.670> where<00:03:29.880> you're<00:03:30.030> exactly<00:03:30.600> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
but I don't know where you're exactly to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.130 
but I don't know where you're exactly to
make<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:31.770> lot<00:03:32.040> easier<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:33.930> that's

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
make a lot easier so that if that's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.660 
make a lot easier so that if that's
probably<00:03:34.740> come<00:03:34.950> right<00:03:35.130> through<00:03:35.160> here<00:03:35.340> out

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
probably come right through here out

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.420 
probably come right through here out
this<00:03:38.000> panda<00:03:39.000> subsection<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.630> care<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:42.260> metal

this panda subsection to care is metal

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.370 
this panda subsection to care is metal
rather<00:03:44.430> than<00:03:44.640> wood<00:03:45.020> which<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.170> little

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
rather than wood which is a little

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.060 
rather than wood which is a little
quicker<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.890> little<00:03:46.980> more<00:03:48.590> easier<00:03:49.590> but

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
quicker and a little more easier but

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.140 
quicker and a little more easier but
today's<00:03:50.280> standards<00:03:50.640> although<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.060> done

wooden cars but this one we observe a
