00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
what you see see I can't see they saw it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.590 
what you see see I can't see they saw it
see<00:01:44.480> what<00:01:44.600> where<00:01:44.810> -<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.260> impound<00:01:46.330> well<00:01:47.330> it's

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
see what where - is it impound well it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.450 
see what where - is it impound well it's
there<00:01:48.220> 5.32<00:01:49.220> pound<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.070> decent<00:01:52.430> size

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
there 5.32 pound so it's a decent size

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.210 
there 5.32 pound so it's a decent size
I've<00:01:52.880> actually<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.480> quite<00:01:53.630> good

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
I've actually it's quite good

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.290

considering<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.640> went<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.880> see<00:01:58.300> just

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
considering that you went to see just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.750 
considering that you went to see just
about<00:01:59.450> four<00:01:59.780> pounds<00:02:00.050> when<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.410> next<00:02:00.760> finally

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
about four pounds when the next finally

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.640 
about four pounds when the next finally
shriveled<00:02:02.120> up

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
shriveled up

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.810 
shriveled up
so<00:02:03.650> I<00:02:03.710> leave<00:02:03.860> I'll<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:03.980> pull<00:02:04.250> another<00:02:04.490> couple

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
so I leave I'll just pull another couple

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.859 
so I leave I'll just pull another couple
up<00:02:05.170> quickly<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.119> not<00:02:08.119> that's<00:02:08.240> not<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.690> best

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
up quickly so not that's not the best

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.419 
up quickly so not that's not the best

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.990 
so I've got some decent ones now these
didn't<00:05:25.640> go<00:05:25.730> to<00:05:25.790> seed<00:05:26.980> these<00:05:27.980> are<00:05:28.130> perfect<00:05:28.640> so

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
didn't go to seed these are perfect so

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.750 
didn't go to seed these are perfect so
there's<00:05:29.150> no<00:05:29.270> seed<00:05:29.600> head<00:05:29.810> in<00:05:29.930> these<00:05:30.580> but<00:05:31.580> these

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
there's no seed head in these but these

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.290 
there's no seed head in these but these
are<00:05:31.970> just<00:05:32.060> monsters<00:05:33.220> that's<00:05:34.220> actually<00:05:34.700> that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
are just monsters that's actually that

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.240 
are just monsters that's actually that
was<00:05:35.450> seven<00:05:35.900> pounds<00:05:36.290> two<00:05:36.470> ounces<00:05:36.500> with<00:05:37.100> the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
was seven pounds two ounces with the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.940 
was seven pounds two ounces with the
leaves<00:05:37.460> there<00:05:37.900> and<00:05:38.900> it's<00:05:39.020> about<00:05:39.230> just<00:05:39.710> shot<00:05:39.919> a

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
leaves there and it's about just shot a

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.030 
leaves there and it's about just shot a
six<00:05:40.250> pound<00:05:40.490> now<00:05:41.530> so<00:05:42.530> I've<00:05:42.620> got<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.860> sacrifice

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
six pound now so I've got to sacrifice

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.710 
six pound now so I've got to sacrifice
the<00:05:43.550> chance<00:05:43.760> of<00:05:43.880> getting<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.120> ten<00:05:44.300> pound<00:05:44.600> of

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
the chance of getting the ten pound of

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.820 
the chance of getting the ten pound of
this<00:05:44.810> year<00:05:44.990> by<00:05:47.050> pulling<00:05:48.050> those<00:05:48.200> ups<00:05:48.500> but<00:05:48.710> at

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
this year by pulling those ups but at

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.140 
this year by pulling those ups but at
least<00:05:48.919> I<00:05:49.070> should<00:05:49.130> have<00:05:49.370> some<00:05:49.550> others<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:49.970> share

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
least I should have some others to share

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.190 
least I should have some others to share
and<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.419> think<00:05:50.630> there's<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:50.870> could<00:05:51.020> make<00:05:51.169> a

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
and I think there's I could make a

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.620 
and I think there's I could make a
decent<00:05:51.500> pair<00:05:51.860> out<00:05:52.070> of<00:05:52.220> those<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:53.180> can't

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
decent pair out of those you can't

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.630 
decent pair out of those you can't
really<00:05:53.780> tell<00:05:54.080> from<00:05:54.200> here<00:05:54.350> but<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:55.310> then

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
really tell from here but and then

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.100 
really tell from here but and then
there's<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> big<00:05:56.000> one<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.300> go<00:05:56.419> in<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.660> class<00:05:56.960> on

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
there's a big one to go in and class on

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.800 
there's a big one to go in and class on
its<00:05:57.229> own<00:05:57.410> so<00:05:57.940> I've<00:05:58.940> got<00:05:59.060> about<00:05:59.150> six<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.720> are
