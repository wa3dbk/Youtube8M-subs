00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bottom and then just as you have a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
bottom and then just as you have a
couple<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.370> white<00:01:02.489> roots<00:01:03.000> growing<00:01:03.239> off

the<00:01:03.629> bottom<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.530> want<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:04.890> ahead<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the bottom you want to go ahead and just

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.149 
the bottom you want to go ahead and just
plant<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> ground<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
plant that in the ground you want to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
plant that in the ground you want to
make<00:01:08.310> certain<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.939> plant<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.810> an

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
make certain that you plant it in an

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
make certain that you plant it in an
area<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.670> moist<00:01:12.030> soil<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.250> recommend<00:01:14.250> using<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
area with moist soil I recommend using a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
area with moist soil I recommend using a
mixture<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> garden<00:01:16.500> soil<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:17.189> soil

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
mixture of garden soil with soil

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.690 
mixture of garden soil with soil
amendment<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.659> compost<00:01:19.380> water<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> with

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
amendment or compost water it with

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
amendment or compost water it with
compost<00:01:21.270> tea<00:01:21.600> keep<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> nice<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.439> moist<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
compost tea keep it nice and moist and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.359 
compost tea keep it nice and moist and
that<00:01:23.310> oregano<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.330> grow<00:01:24.920> now<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.189> you're<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that oregano will grow now if you're a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
that oregano will grow now if you're a
little<00:01:26.610> more<00:01:26.820> adventurous<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.720> actually<00:01:27.930> want

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
little more adventurous I actually want

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
little more adventurous I actually want
to<00:01:28.470> show<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.520> larger<00:01:30.000> area<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> oregano

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to show you this larger area of oregano

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.969 
to show you this larger area of oregano
I<00:01:31.229> literally<00:01:31.950> pulled<00:01:32.990> some<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.439> about

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I literally pulled some of this about

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.630 
I literally pulled some of this about
two<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.659> three

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
two or three I think it's actually three

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.520 
two or three I think it's actually three
stems<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.420> friend<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.780> Mines<00:01:39.990> oregano

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
stems from a friend of Mines oregano

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
stems from a friend of Mines oregano
plant<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.909> stripped<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
plant and I just stripped it just like I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
plant and I just stripped it just like I
showed<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.640> stuck<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
showed you and I actually stuck it in

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
showed you and I actually stuck it in
the<00:01:45.390> ground<00:01:45.420> no<00:01:46.380> roots<00:01:46.740> nothing<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.970> just

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the ground no roots nothing and I just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.929 
the ground no roots nothing and I just
kept<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.600> area<00:01:49.020> fairly<00:01:49.380> moist<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.729> can

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
kept this area fairly moist and you can

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.749 
kept this area fairly moist and you can
see<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.899> flourished<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.860> fact<00:01:53.280> what

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
see it's really flourished in fact what

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
see it's really flourished in fact what
I<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> rip<00:01:55.259> out

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I have to do is I have to rip out

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
I have to do is I have to rip out
segments<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> regular<00:01:56.729> basis

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
segments of it on a regular basis

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.410 
segments of it on a regular basis
because<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.320> pretty<00:01:58.649> invasive<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.520> that's

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
because it's pretty invasive and that's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
because it's pretty invasive and that's
another<00:02:00.719> option<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.770> friend<00:02:02.189> like

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
another option if you have a friend like

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.969 
another option if you have a friend like
