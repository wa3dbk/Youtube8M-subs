00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.710
 hello everyone i'm rz and today i'm here in 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.210
 gt to comment on a new episode of the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.090
 tomahawks guide in search and destroy 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.200
 of black ops 2 how much time already without 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.620
 be here 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.620
 today we are in is loops and let's start 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 for the 1st tomahawk of the wing pump 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.440
 we will place in the corner of the pump 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.440
 like the strawberries 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.620
 Once the bomb is placed we go 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.270
 here and we stand at the corner between 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.090
 the mattress east of the nap and the wall 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.439
 and we bend over and look at everything 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 we can go up with the chrono 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:20.120
 shooter to center it and we throw it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.120
 and let's go 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.290
 perfect to see this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.490
 I get the impression that it takes an effect 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.719
 super weird for the left but it's 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 thing of the camera I do not know if to you 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.609
 it has also happened to you but it does not matter 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.859
 let's go with the second tomahawk of the 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.979
 up pump according to the latest report of 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.709
 the good pump for this pump the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.299
 we will place on the wide side 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.709
 as you see and we're leaving 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.830
 practically to one of the backups 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.600
 good 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.650
 a little more ahead and we are situated 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 between the garbage juices and the wall we 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.490
 we bend over and look again at everything 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 we can go up and focus it and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.170
 there it goes 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.000
 and again the moon 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.259
 I think that's what I'm going to do every time 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.259
 that we will do a job 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.450
 we will see 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.410
 let's go with the be be donkey bomb 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.100
 this time we will place it in the corner of 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.450
 the pump as in the 1st tomahawk there 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.290
 right where to shoot with the one that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.360
 question and we will go between 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.130
 barrels and the wooden plank that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.200
 is supported there in the nice then there 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.850
 we bend over and look at everything 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.060
 we can upward we focus it to the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.720
 pump and enable fly 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.840
 we stuck it bakunin which one 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.840
 good another direct tomahawk 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 there you see it simple and also it was very 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.760
 far away what is cool 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.829
 and we go with the most complicated tomahawk 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.829
 of the map this time we will place it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.760
 in the center of the wide side of the pump 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.349
 of water 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.769
 we have returned to the water pump as 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.209
 you have seen and we are between the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.209
 van and the murito 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.230
 once placed like this we will take as 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.230
 reference the leaves of the palm tree and 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.580
 right where is dani shooting 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.000
 you have to put the tomahawk to that 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.860
 height at the height of 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.410
 from that hospital and move it to the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.630
 left until you are out of the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.840
 palm tree I do not know if you have understood me 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.920
 but the case gets like zealand 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.920
 and that's what we 're going 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.700
 a magnificent bounce 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.700
 for me 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.019
 and now we go with the second and last 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.680
 we will place the bomb issue in the 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.200
 fat side of the pump 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.239
 Shopping 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.920
 once placed we will go to the edge 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.440
 of the map practically on the edge of the map 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.200
 and we will place ourselves between the sofa that I think 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.549
 which is a sofa and the bank we look at everything 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.090
 what we can upwards we center it 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.090
 to the pump and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.930
 this 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.220
 I do not know if it was inspired by this 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.220
 but good does not matter 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.900
 you see another job well stop 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.490
 well this is not because it bounces on the ground 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.940
 but it is direct in rne that it bounces us 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.940
 no couple 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.099
 and practically this has been everything I hope 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:50.769
 that you liked it and you find it very 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:54.629
 useful and see you in the next video 

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:54.629
 tomahawk until next time
