00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.370
 hi friends Estevez I bring you this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.730
 new revision of less than the third 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.520
 movie after putting together 330 us 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.360
 by sam raimi and this is a donut 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.940
 how his five went out in the movie 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.630
 minutes of fame that the truth only 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.339
 they were five minutes good 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.339
 the figure brings 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.490
 bring this 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 this seed cobweb 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.660
 what is a plastic 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.620
 not very soft but it's hard but 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.120
 the soft 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.840
 and good 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.210
 let's see the detail not be not the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 teeth your eyes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.800
 of a color like a purple 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.580
 a new home a dark 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.580
 language 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.580
 soft 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.480
 we see that the cobwebs have the spider 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.020
 It has very thin legs that do not 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.619
 He liked good 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.929
 joint can move its head towards 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.670
 up turns 360 degrees 360 degrees 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.380
 go sideways and it's 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.490
 absolutely everything has no articulation 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 in the elbow or in the hand 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.380
 it has a joint in the waist but 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.510
 does not stay because thanks they put in what 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.630
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.740
 if you tour him 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740
 give a blow 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 have been forward and backwards it's all 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.870
 what can 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.050
 and can open legs 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.890
 has double articulation in the knee 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.530
 and nothing else can turn this joint 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.670
 above 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.220
 and it is not all of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.280
 to the articulation that has as 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.870
 limited we see that it has cobwebs 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.870
 that form as the boot 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.629
 It also has a kind of belt 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.629
 as spider-man 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.980
 well in details also the truth does not 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:44.280
 I really liked how they made oats in the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.790
 movie but they provoke what we got 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790
 Y 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.700
 this father I do not remember how much it cost me 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.230
 because they were like 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.409
 150 or 200 pesos 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.560
 Well, it gave me more moments of 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:07.470
 fun if we compare it with the size 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.470
 of a sea vÃ©lez jones 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:16.750
 and it stays a little short in the short 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.210
 if we compare it with the size of 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.800
 spiderman of the second movie also 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.970
 it's something more 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.970
 More smalls 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.170
 Y 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.400
 but if they want something they're never going to 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.760
 find good scale with is from the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.060
 true 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.069
 because if we put one of the best in 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.260
 now of marvel legens or the new 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.030
 movie the amazing spider-man is 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.340
 is short and the real one does not win 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.000
 bigger but just go to the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.390
 that the foot of the hand and the very 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.430
 disproportionate with 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 with everyone unless they have more 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 diamond figures the only one that I have 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.940
 from spider-man 3 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.879
 this has been all friends and this then
