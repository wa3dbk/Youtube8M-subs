the biggest problem with a cold email
system<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.350> growing<00:00:19.710> older<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
system was it was growing older and

system was it was growing older and
older<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.970> getting<00:00:21.330> more<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.140> more

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

difficult<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.949> keep<00:00:23.130> pace<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.240> new

difficult to keep pace with the new
versions<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.849> also<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> demand<00:00:27.390> of

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
versions and and also the demand of

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
versions and and also the demand of
increasing<00:00:28.769> storage<00:00:29.640> capacity<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
increasing storage capacity for the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
increasing storage capacity for the
students<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.769> old<00:00:31.949> system<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> son<00:00:32.730> I

planet<00:00:33.360> system<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:35.309> had<00:00:35.550> very

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
planet system and and we had very

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
planet system and and we had very
limited<00:00:36.270> storage<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.500> each<00:00:37.620> student's<00:00:38.070> like

limited storage for each student's like

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.540 
limited storage for each student's like
15<00:00:38.700> megabytes<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.329> per<00:00:40.290> student<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.280> asked<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
15 megabytes or per student we asked the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.670 
15 megabytes or per student we asked the
students<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> students<00:00:42.420> said<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
students and the students said that that

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
students and the students said that that
Google<00:00:43.950> Apps<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.450> prefer<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
Google Apps is as what we prefer and we

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.000 
Google Apps is as what we prefer and we
also<00:00:47.039> did<00:00:47.399> an<00:00:47.870> economical<00:00:48.870> study<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
also did an economical study at that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
also did an economical study at that
time<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.760> found<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> pure

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
time and we found out that from a pure

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
time and we found out that from a pure
economical<00:00:53.190> standpoint<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.760> easier<00:00:54.149> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
economical standpoint it's easier to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.529 
economical standpoint it's easier to
integrate<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:56.370> Google<00:00:56.640> Apps<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.149> change<00:00:57.360> was

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
integrate to Google Apps the change was

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.229 
integrate to Google Apps the change was
seamlessly<00:00:58.530> difficulty<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.489> no<00:00:59.760> problems

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
seamlessly difficulty was no problems

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.369 
seamlessly difficulty was no problems
what<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.870> didn't<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.170> much

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
what I would we didn't get much

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.030 
what I would we didn't get much
questions<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> single<00:01:03.840> sound<00:01:03.960> solution<00:01:04.589> y1

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
questions the single sound solution y1

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
questions the single sound solution y1
which<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.570> place<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.200> was

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
which was when it was in place it was

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
which was when it was in place it was
really<00:01:07.650> working<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> things<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
really working well and things like that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
really working well and things like that
so<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> students<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.770> didn't<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.340> much

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
so the students really didn't have much

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
so the students really didn't have much
issues<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:13.020> Google<00:01:13.320> Apps<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
issues with the with Google Apps and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820 
issues with the with Google Apps and
when<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.850> asked<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.659> focus<00:01:16.020> groups<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
when we asked them in focus groups they

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.910 
when we asked them in focus groups they
tend<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.520> pleased<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.689> tend<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> say

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
tend to be very pleased they tend to say

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
tend to be very pleased they tend to say
that<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.369> platform<00:01:20.640> provides<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.479> they

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that this platform provides what they

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
that this platform provides what they
are<00:01:21.720> looking<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.220> biggest<00:01:23.220> changes<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
are looking for biggest changes is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.719 
are looking for biggest changes is
probably<00:01:24.479> allowing<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.740> students<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
probably allowing the the students to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
probably allowing the the students to
have<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> sort<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> student<00:01:28.530> centric

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
have a sort of a student centric

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.700 
have a sort of a student centric
learning<00:01:29.310> experience<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> if<00:01:31.409> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
learning experience so if you if a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.580 
learning experience so if you if a
teacher<00:01:32.100> teaches<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> class<00:01:33.439> which<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
teacher teaches a class which is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.100 
teacher teaches a class which is
normally<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.070> given<00:01:35.579> electronically<00:01:36.479> which

normally not given electronically which

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
normally not given electronically which
would<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.619> best<00:01:38.189> held<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:39.030> lot<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
would probably best held in a lot of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
would probably best held in a lot of
management<00:01:39.780> system<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.290> rather<00:01:40.850> history<00:01:41.850> or

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
something then the students themselves

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.510 
something then the students themselves
can<00:01:44.369> form<00:01:44.939> ad<00:01:45.240> hoc<00:01:45.960> groups<00:01:46.259> share<00:01:46.890> documents
