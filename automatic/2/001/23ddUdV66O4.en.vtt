00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
unfortunately a brown horse sort of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760 
unfortunately a brown horse sort of
faded<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.910> bit<00:01:39.180> ly<00:01:39.360> didn't<00:01:40.110> run<00:01:40.410> up<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
faded a little bit ly didn't run up to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.850 
faded a little bit ly didn't run up to
what<00:01:40.920> prosit<00:01:41.460> expectations<00:01:42.620> or<00:01:43.620> their

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what prosit expectations or their

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.050 
what prosit expectations or their
expectation<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.950> she<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.160> left<00:01:47.970> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
expectation and then she got it left in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270 
expectation and then she got it left in
front<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.600> bit<00:01:48.810> far<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:49.230> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
front of it a bit far out I think that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.890 
front of it a bit far out I think that
if<00:01:50.550> he<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.090> held<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> another<00:01:51.690> half

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
if he could have held on another half

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.530 
if he could have held on another half
fell<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:55.550> he<00:01:56.550> got<00:01:57.060> could<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.300> gone<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> other

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
fell on he got could have gone the other

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.670 
fell on he got could have gone the other
way<00:01:57.690> at<00:01:57.870> York<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.160> other<00:01:59.250> hand<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.520> ring<00:02:00.680> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
way at York on the other hand the ring I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.880 
way at York on the other hand the ring I
would<00:02:02.310> probably<00:02:02.870> start<00:02:04.580> twice<00:02:05.580> over<00:02:05.760> rolling

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
would probably start twice over rolling

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.619 
would probably start twice over rolling
probably<00:02:07.890> fell<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.789> earlier<00:02:09.149> than<00:02:09.299> i<00:02:09.359> did<00:02:09.420> a

coronation guess you're right but if
you're<00:02:24.120> right<00:02:24.239> i<00:02:24.269> mean<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.569> know<00:02:24.599> i<00:02:24.810> mean<00:02:24.900> she

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
you're right i mean you know i mean she

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.809

should<00:02:25.500> head<00:02:25.769> there<00:02:25.950> again<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.610> me<00:02:26.700> she

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
should head there again you know me she

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.270 
should head there again you know me she
got<00:02:26.910> left<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.180> front<00:02:27.379> she<00:02:28.379> went<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.769> long<00:02:29.069> way

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
got left in front she went a long way

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.180 
got left in front she went a long way
out<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.780> think<00:02:31.080> she's<00:02:31.200> got<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.739> burst

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
out and I think she's got that one burst

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.130 
out and I think she's got that one burst
name<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.640> fell<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.940> fine<00:02:33.599> but<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:34.049> when

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
name and fell on fine but I think when

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110 
name and fell on fine but I think when
you<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.489> two<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> half<00:02:35.730> three<00:02:35.879> furlongs

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you get to two and a half three furlongs

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.500 
you get to two and a half three furlongs
it's<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.569> different<00:02:36.930> matter<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:38.209> mean<00:02:39.209> they<00:02:39.299> both

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
it's a different matter I mean they both

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.600 
it's a different matter I mean they both
you<00:02:39.810> wouldn't<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.470> actually<00:02:40.980> which<00:02:41.489> we

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
how tough it is but then what now we've

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.700

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
I think because exactly the same tough

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.929 
I think because exactly the same tough
almost<00:05:27.990> impossible<00:05:28.469> but<00:05:29.219> we<00:05:29.340> just<00:05:29.460> just<00:05:29.789> keep

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
almost impossible but we just just keep

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.209 
almost impossible but we just just keep
going<00:05:30.120> and<00:05:30.180> see<00:05:30.240> what<00:05:30.389> happens<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.710> Vita<00:05:31.949> Nova
