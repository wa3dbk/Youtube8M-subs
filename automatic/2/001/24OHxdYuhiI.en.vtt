00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
about ten dollars each time that I think

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.959 
about ten dollars each time that I think
is<00:00:55.590> important<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.460> shows<00:00:56.489> your

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
is important because it shows your

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
is important because it shows your
stylist<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.539> growth<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> growth<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.699> way

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
stylist a growth a way of growth a way

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
stylist a growth a way of growth a way
of<00:01:00.570> gross<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> makes<00:01:01.320> sense<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.340> it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of gross if that makes sense but it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
of gross if that makes sense but it's
going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> take<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.090> stylist<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> give<00:01:03.780> them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going to take your stylist and give them

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
going to take your stylist and give them
a<00:01:04.019> career<00:01:04.320> path<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
a career path and I think if you just

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.320 
a career path and I think if you just
have<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.570> commission<00:01:07.530> percentage<00:01:08.330> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
have one commission percentage then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
have one commission percentage then
they're<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:10.740> reason<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
they're not going to have any reason to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
they're not going to have any reason to
try<00:01:12.060> harder<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.450> push<00:01:12.780> themselves<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> keep

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
try harder to push themselves to keep

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
try harder to push themselves to keep
watching<00:01:14.189> their<00:01:14.340> numbers<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> keep<00:01:15.119> growing

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
watching their numbers and keep growing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
watching their numbers and keep growing
so<00:01:16.080> definitely<00:01:16.799> make<00:01:17.009> sure<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so definitely make sure that you do that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
so definitely make sure that you do that
if<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> computer<00:01:18.990> software<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.740> use
