 this afternoon we are going to bring you a 'top ten' 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.860
 the 'top ten' of animals in danger of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.860
 extinction 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.910
 numerous are the species that 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.190
 they are currently in danger 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.930
 of extinction most of them due 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 to the direct or indirect action of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.460
 man for example climate change 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.130
 the destruction of their habitat hunting 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.440
 furtive we'll show you a list with 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.020
 10 of the critically endangered species 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 conservation but there are many more 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.270
 example whales some species of 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.580
 shark the polar bear are a protection 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.340
 ambitious can get us to save 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.960
 these fascinating species and today you 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.190
 let's bring the 'top ten' of those 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.190
 animals in danger of extinction 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.679
 Let's start with the rhino 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 java hunted mostly because of the 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.520
 properties that are attributed to your 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 horn in traditional Chinese medicine 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.770
 and as a decorative object there were only 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.380
 about 29 specimens on the island of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.579
 java and nenito nyesa in indonesia that was 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.329
 in the year 2012 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.959
 we are in 2015 how many rhinoceroses 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.959
 java will be 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.150
 then we have the snow leopard 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.920
 this species is threatened by the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.190
 invasion of their habitat by man 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.070
 china pakistan india nepal live in a 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.630
 surroundings like the himalayas 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.390
 has not prevented that there are only less than 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.729
 5000 copies this feline can get 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.770
 to live up to 6000 meters of altitude 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.660
 in addition it is traded with its skin and in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.090
 occasions feeds farm animals 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.950
 so it is doubted in in flip-flops or 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.770
 if you do not attack the sheep , 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.770
 leopard because I kill you 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.829
 we continue with felines because we are going to 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.290
 speak now of the tiger its population has 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.329
 decreased to more than 60 percent by 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.489
 the human invasion of their habitat and of 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.230
 new poaching is also 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.959
 attribute oriental medicine powers 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.030
 the biggest feline on the planet before 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.129
 he was at ease from turkey to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.260
 Russia currently have already 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.930
 cca subspecies disappeared 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.450
 cold I left southern china and now 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.780
 they only live in zoos and also in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 bali 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 we go to the sea there we go to 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.080
 find with the bluefin tuna in serious 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.450
 danger of extinction is taking 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.210
 measures to reduce their fishing since the 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.020
 sushi boom betting tpc on the pillory 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.030
 overfishing has reduced by 85% its 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.860
 population in recent years by 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.830
 endanger this species that was very 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.270
 abundant in the decade of the 60 we are 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.270
 talking about bluefin tuna 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.250
 of the bluefin tuna we go to the elephant 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.989
 Asian in danger mainly 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.239
 due to the deforestation of the zones 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.129
 who are already occupying their furtive house to 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.410
 get the precious ivory from their 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.090
 fangs currently trading 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.530
 ivory is prohibited but it is still 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.530
 practicing in the black market 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.739
 again we go into the sea to 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.930
 talk about the vaquita marine lives in the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.790
 gulf of mexico and in 2012 diverse 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.249
 organizations have accounted for so 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.620
 only 200 copies of this beautiful and 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:59.200
 small marsÃ³ for its habitat is very 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.599
 reduced and fishing with nets is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.219
 fostering their disappearance this species 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.700
 it does not exist anywhere else in the 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.700
 planet 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.190
 in the mountain we find the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.190
 mountain gorilla gorilla 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.160
 the plain gorilla seems safe but 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.460
 his partner the mountain one could 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.500
 disappear completely in the year 2025 in 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.210
 critical situation are only found 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.220
 some populations in the vicinity 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.550
 of the Congo River in Rwanda in Uganda and in 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.950
 The Congo causes the disappearance of 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.890
 its habitat by logging and over 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.780
 all over again for poaching in 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.690
 the virunga national park where there is more 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.610
 copies have been murdered more than 190 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.050
 forest guards what denotes the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.650
 great existing struggle for its 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 conservation 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.440
 another one of those animals that is in 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.130
 danger of extinction is the dolphin of 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.110
 curious irrawaddy river water dweller 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.180
 Sweets from south-southwest Asia 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.430
 mostly concentrated in mekong in 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.270
 vietnam in thailand in cambodia and in 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.070
 Laos 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.139
 dies because the level of 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.210
 salinity of the waters and by the little 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.190
 survival of the offspring also by 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.750
 pollution of the area and by the 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.580
 form used for fishing 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.820
 recently famous and marketed 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.770
 panga fish in 2011 only 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.770
 accounted for 85 copies 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:37.209
 we're still talking about apes and now 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:37.209
 let's talk about the sumatra orangutan 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.570
 their hunting and selling as pets and 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.670
 large extractive industries 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.130
 palm oil are the causes of their 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.530
 critical situation these consider the 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.660
 orangutan enemy of crops and not 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.580
 hesitate to make them disappear 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.990
 Indonesia has lost more than half of 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.530
 the surface of its tropical forests 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.540
 in the last 50 years to favor 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.880
 these plantations can only be 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.390
 find this ape in borneo and in 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.390
 Sumatra 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.849
 we finished the space with the turtle 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.919
 leatherback 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:15.389
 a species of sea turtle and it 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.029
 is in serious danger of extinction 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.009
 together with the leatherback turtle although each 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.679
 they attract more to fishing tourism 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.839
 accidental pollution of the waters 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:27.300
 and hunting to get its shell the 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:30.539
 meat or also the eggs have made a 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.069
 brutal dent in these animals after 150 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.800
 millions of years according to scientists 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.759
 on the planet they may not survive the 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.759
 effect of man 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.360
 two 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.620
 today in the space of the shaker we have 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.310
 talked about the 'top ten' of animals in 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.310
 danger of extinction 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.689
 most of those animals are in 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.819
 danger of extinction due to the 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.979
 direct action of man also to 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.259
 climate change that influences the 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.629
 habitat destruction poaching 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.669
 and many other things more we you 

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:11.120
