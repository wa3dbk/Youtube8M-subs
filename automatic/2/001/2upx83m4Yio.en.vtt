00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is the Maybelline define a brow and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.990 
this is the Maybelline define a brow and
I<00:00:06.420> had<00:00:06.569> this<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.930> dark<00:00:07.140> brown<00:00:07.880> let's<00:00:08.880> go

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
I had this in dark brown let's go

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.150 
I had this in dark brown let's go
through<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.240> cons<00:00:09.480> first<00:00:09.980> basically<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> don't

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
through the cons first basically I don't

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.890 
through the cons first basically I don't
like<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> packaging<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.420> color<00:00:12.660> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
like the packaging because the color is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.070 
like the packaging because the color is
really<00:00:13.259> weird<00:00:13.950> looking<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.670> me<00:00:14.820> lime<00:00:15.780> green

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
really weird looking to me lime green

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.680 
really weird looking to me lime green
and<00:00:16.109> brown<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.830> doesn't<00:00:17.070> sit<00:00:17.250> well<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.430> me

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
and brown just doesn't sit well with me

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.519 
and brown just doesn't sit well with me
the<00:00:18.690> other<00:00:18.869> thing<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.199> don't<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.439> about

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the other thing that I don't like about

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.800 
the other thing that I don't like about
it<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.609> comb<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.539> comes<00:00:21.720> with

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
it is that the comb that it comes with

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.220 
it is that the comb that it comes with
is<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.680> cheap<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.570> mean<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> don't<00:00:24.869> only<00:00:24.990> see

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
is really cheap I mean I don't only see

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.650 
is really cheap I mean I don't only see
it<00:00:25.350> being<00:00:25.939> realistic<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.300> comb<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.599> your

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it being realistic to comb out your

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.839 
it being realistic to comb out your
brows<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> plastic<00:00:28.920> thingy<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.609> I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
brows with this plastic thingy so I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.120 
brows with this plastic thingy so I
don't<00:00:30.269> use<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:31.560> see<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
don't use that but I can see how it is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
don't use that but I can see how it is
convenient<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.390> you're<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.230> out

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
convenient for you if you're like out

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.930 
convenient for you if you're like out
somewhere<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.950> don't<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.250> anything<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
somewhere and you don't have anything to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
somewhere and you don't have anything to
help<00:00:36.120> groom<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.680> come<00:00:37.890> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
help groom it so this would come in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.690 
help groom it so this would come in
handy<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.079> don't<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.430> last

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
handy but I don't use that and the last

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100 
handy but I don't use that and the last
thing<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.719> bugs<00:00:42.930> me<00:00:43.020> about

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because at first when I was using it i

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.849 
because at first when I was using it i

just kept twisting the product up and up

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
just kept twisting the product up and up
and<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.100> until<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.820> had<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.300> much

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359

and up until i had like this much
product<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.650> realized<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.100> couldn't

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
product and then I realized I couldn't

twist it back down so you really have to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
twist it back down so you really have to
be<00:01:07.350> careful<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.520> know<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:08.760> it

won't<00:01:09.479> let<00:01:09.630> me<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.869> back<00:01:10.049> down<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.939> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
won't let me go back down but that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.660 
won't let me go back down but that
really<00:01:12.090> made<00:01:12.390> me<00:01:12.510> irritated<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

things that I do like about this I do
like<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.700> really<00:01:18.030> fine<00:01:18.299> tip<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
like how it has a really fine tip so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.550 
like how it has a really fine tip so
it's<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.890> small<00:01:21.229> small<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> good

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
because it gives me good control so if I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
because it gives me good control so if I
want<00:01:26.520> something<00:01:26.790> more<00:01:26.939> precise<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.900> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
want something more precise I can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
want something more precise I can
definitely<00:01:28.520> do<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.729> lot<00:01:29.909> better<00:01:30.090> than<00:01:30.450> if

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
definitely do this a lot better than if

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
definitely do this a lot better than if
I<00:01:30.689> were<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> use<00:01:31.049> powder<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.590> lot<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.369> guys

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I were to use powder a lot of you guys

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
I were to use powder a lot of you guys
know<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:33.000> used<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.689> powder<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.470> fill<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.770> my

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.469 
know I used to use powder to fill in my
brows<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> color<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> spurts

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
brows but the color is kind of spurts

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.510 
brows but the color is kind of spurts
everywhere<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.710> gives<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.460> of
