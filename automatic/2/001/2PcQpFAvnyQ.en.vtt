apparently<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.250> teleport<00:01:47.759> too<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.210> then

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
apparently if i teleport too much then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
apparently if i teleport too much then
it<00:01:48.570> might<00:01:48.689> alert<00:01:49.110> Jaina<00:01:49.619> Proudmoore<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.399> my

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it might alert Jaina Proudmoore to my

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.690 
it might alert Jaina Proudmoore to my

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
just jumped on a little bit I tried lots

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.220 
just jumped on a little bit I tried lots
of<00:02:19.680> different<00:02:19.740> avenues<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.430> attack<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.240> see<00:02:22.080> if

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
of different avenues of attack to see if

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.690 
of different avenues of attack to see if
there<00:02:22.410> was<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.560> route<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> could<00:02:23.460> take

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
there was a route that you could take

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
there was a route that you could take
where<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.150> didn't<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.320> alert<00:02:25.590> single

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
where you didn't have to alert single

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.630 
where you didn't have to alert single
guard<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:27.140> i<00:02:28.140> genuinely<00:02:28.440> couldn't<00:02:29.130> find<00:02:29.400> one

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640

guard and i genuinely couldn't find one
I<00:02:29.900> could<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.170> find<00:02:31.560> any<00:02:31.950> route<00:02:32.400> whatsoever

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
I could not find any route whatsoever

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.210 
I could not find any route whatsoever
that<00:02:33.930> would<00:02:34.080> allow<00:02:34.290> me<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.590> get<00:02:34.740> past<00:02:35.010> without

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
that would allow me to get past without

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.480 
that would allow me to get past without
alerting<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:36.210> single<00:02:36.780> solitary<00:02:37.230> guard<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.130> this

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
alerting a single solitary guard so this

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.950 
alerting a single solitary guard so this
short<00:02:38.970> time<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> trying<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.870> what

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
short time and trying to see what

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.780 
short time and trying to see what
happens<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.440> go<00:02:40.590> past<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.190> guard<00:02:41.490> with<00:02:41.640> its

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
happens if I go past a guard with its

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.720 
happens if I go past a guard with its
back<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.270> me<00:02:42.390> again<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.770> still<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.370> growed<00:02:44.700> in

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
back to me again it's still a growed in

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.490 
back to me again it's still a growed in
but<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.270> time<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.290> fight

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
but this time we're not going to fight

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.030 
but this time we're not going to fight
it<00:02:46.530> we're<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.660> run<00:02:48.660> into<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.990> dead<00:02:49.200> end<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
it we're going to run into a dead end so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
it we're going to run into a dead end so
we're<00:02:50.160> gonna<00:02:50.250> leave<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.990> good<00:02:51.990> leave<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
we're gonna leave that good leave that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.620 
we're gonna leave that good leave that
dead<00:02:52.710> end<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.640> then<00:02:53.850> come<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.360> way<00:02:54.600> but

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
dead end and then come out this way but

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.810 
dead end and then come out this way but
as<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.110> see<00:02:55.380> it's<00:02:56.040> only<00:02:56.370> hitting<00:02:56.490> me<00:02:56.610> for

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
as you can see it's only hitting me for

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.120 
as you can see it's only hitting me for
around<00:02:57.060> 10<00:02:57.360> 11<00:02:57.720> k<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:58.710> going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> lose

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
around 10 11 k and it's going to lose

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650 
around 10 11 k and it's going to lose
interest<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.880> go<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> lost<00:03:00.330> interest

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
interest there you go to lost interest

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.050 
interest there you go to lost interest
already<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.170> lost<00:03:01.380> me<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.880> an

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
already it's lost me so it's an

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.970 
already it's lost me so it's an
interesting<00:03:03.210> little<00:03:03.750> concept<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.650> just

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
interesting little concept this just

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.850 
interesting little concept this just
don't<00:03:05.160> attack<00:03:05.640> ride<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.260> you'll

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
don't attack ride it out and then you'll

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
don't attack ride it out and then you'll
eventually<00:03:08.280> find<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:09.000> way<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.180> wherever<00:03:09.570> you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
eventually find your way to wherever you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.070 
eventually find your way to wherever you
need<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.900> go<00:03:11.300> when<00:03:12.300> you're<00:03:12.450> not<00:03:12.570> getting<00:03:12.780> lost

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
need to go when you're not getting lost

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
need to go when you're not getting lost
I<00:03:15.110> really<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.320> should<00:03:16.710> probably<00:03:17.010> look

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
I really I really should probably look

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.740 
I really I really should probably look
at<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> map<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.730> think<00:03:17.970> you're<00:03:18.060> doing<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.390> second

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
at a map I think you're doing a second

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.590 
at a map I think you're doing a second
actually<00:03:19.700> cuz<00:03:20.700> I'm<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:21.030> going<00:03:21.270> down<00:03:21.420> down

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
actually cuz I'm just going down down

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.290 
actually cuz I'm just going down down
asses<00:03:21.960> thinking<00:03:22.260> whether<00:03:22.590> chuffa<00:03:23.580> my<00:03:23.910> men<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
asses thinking whether chuffa my men to

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.050 
asses thinking whether chuffa my men to
be<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.680> all<00:03:25.800> gravy<00:03:26.070> out<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:26.520> I'm<00:03:26.670> away<00:03:26.940> in

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
be but it's all gravy out if I'm away in

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.570 
be but it's all gravy out if I'm away in
a<00:03:27.120> second<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.260> we're<00:03:28.470> coming<00:03:28.740> up<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
a second so we're coming up to the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.700 
a second so we're coming up to the
entrance<00:03:29.730> area<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:31.290> need<00:03:31.500> to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
entrance area that we we need to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.620 
entrance area that we we need to
discover<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.460> it's<00:03:32.670> actually<00:03:32.850> hidden<00:03:33.270> in<00:03:33.510> a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
discover and it's actually hidden in a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.200 
discover and it's actually hidden in a
tree<00:03:34.170> trunk<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> whole

tree trunk I think that's the whole

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.330 
tree trunk I think that's the whole
point<00:03:36.480> with<00:03:36.660> all<00:03:36.780> these<00:03:36.900> hippie<00:03:37.710> druid<00:03:38.130> type

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.380 
half of their buildings are actually
hollowed-out<00:03:43.020> trees<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.310> when<00:03:45.060> i'm<00:03:45.180> down<00:03:45.360> at

just think it's a regular tree but no no
no<00:03:49.170> there's<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> base<00:03:49.740> inside<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:51.180> we've<00:03:51.300> got

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
no there's a base inside so we've got

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.750 
no there's a base inside so we've got
these<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:52.020> we<00:03:52.110> go<00:03:52.230> darn<00:03:52.590> assian<00:03:53.040> protectors

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
at the bottom so what we're going to do

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.729 
at the bottom so what we're going to do
is<00:04:17.549> when<00:04:17.790> we<00:04:17.970> discover<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.690> bell<00:04:18.900> we're<00:04:19.590> then

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
going to right-click on to it which will

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.130 
going to right-click on to it which will
kind<00:04:22.229> of<00:04:22.320> attach<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.800> beacon<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.370> sorts<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
kind of attach a beacon of sorts and

kind of attach a beacon of sorts and
then<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
then the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.500 
then the
and<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:27.540> blood<00:04:27.960> elves<00:04:28.139> are<00:04:28.500> gonna<00:04:28.710> teleport

the<00:04:30.510> bailout<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.680> silver<00:04:32.250> me<00:04:32.370> while<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.790> will

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
the bailout to silver me while we will

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.270 
the bailout to silver me while we will
study<00:04:33.180> at<00:04:33.330> 40<00:04:33.540> means<00:04:33.930> now<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.530> thought<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.070> could

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
study at 40 means now I thought I could

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.090 
study at 40 means now I thought I could
have<00:04:35.370> waited<00:04:35.580> for<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.449> this<00:04:36.720> guy<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.979> do

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
have waited for this this guy to to do

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.830 
have waited for this this guy to to do
his<00:04:38.250> patrol<00:04:38.639> but<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.940> thought<00:04:39.180> screw<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.600> I

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
his patrol but I thought screw it I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.620 
his patrol but I thought screw it I
could<00:04:40.020> only<00:04:40.110> see<00:04:40.440> one<00:04:40.740> see<00:04:41.520> any<00:04:41.610> person<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.330> I

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
could only see one see any person so I

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.090 
could only see one see any person so I
thought<00:04:42.960> might<00:04:43.169> as<00:04:43.229> well<00:04:43.350> attack<00:04:43.590> if<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:43.979> was

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
thought might as well attack if that was

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.700 
thought might as well attack if that was
the<00:04:44.220> Bell<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:44.690> again<00:04:45.690> goes<00:04:46.139> down<00:04:46.380> in<00:04:46.530> no

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
the Bell there again goes down in no

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.140 
the Bell there again goes down in no
time<00:04:46.740> they're<00:04:47.310> not<00:04:47.430> very<00:04:47.580> difficult<00:04:47.820> these

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
time they're not very difficult these

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.540 
time they're not very difficult these
people<00:04:48.840> aren't<00:04:49.020> elites<00:04:49.860> like<00:04:50.190> they<00:04:50.310> were<00:04:50.430> in

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
people aren't elites like they were in

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.710 
people aren't elites like they were in
the<00:04:50.639> last<00:04:50.850> video<00:04:51.000> they're<00:04:51.330> just<00:04:51.540> regular

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
the last video they're just regular

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.830 
the last video they're just regular
level<00:04:52.110> 90<00:04:52.560> s<00:04:52.620> there<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.669> I'm<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:53.970> claw<00:04:54.300> fee<00:04:54.510> no

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
level 90 s there and I'm a claw fee no

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.200 
level 90 s there and I'm a claw fee no
problem<00:04:55.110> at<00:04:55.169> all<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:56.190> there<00:04:56.340> we<00:04:56.430> go<00:04:56.460> right

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
problem at all so there we go right

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.719 
problem at all so there we go right
clicked<00:04:57.570> use<00:04:57.990> my<00:04:58.139> teleport<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:59.310> back<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.639> the

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
clicked use my teleport go back to the

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.150 
clicked use my teleport go back to the
base<00:04:59.940> hand<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.620> think<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:02.039> only

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
base hand it in so I think that only

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.790 
base hand it in so I think that only
leads<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.580> more<00:05:02.900> parts<00:05:03.900> of<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:04.410> whole

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
leads to more parts of this whole

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.400 
leads to more parts of this whole
