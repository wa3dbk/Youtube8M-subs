00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.979

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 all welcome to sandra if you arcs 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 such that I run like the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 today's video is going to be giving in some 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 tips to look more beautiful every day 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 next is to say are tips that we are going to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 apply during the night and I'm going to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.779
 be sharing several accessories that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.939
 use for that to look cuter to the day 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 next we all like to wear a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 nice and healthy hair that's why I also 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 I'm always experimenting and when I saw 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.950
 this hat that promises a pile of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.990
 things made me want to try it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.370
 apart from that it is handmade and if 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.740
 they enter the girl's room that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 ago will remove all explanation 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.250
 the frizz the electricity of the hair what 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.290
 keeps hydrated he cares for it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 we slept finally I step with the hat 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.160
 as with the microfiber cloth for 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.900
 I've been putting it on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 nights after putting a few drops of 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.290
 argan oil media to tip 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 you know that argan oil 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.250
 moisturizes and nourishes and not only hair 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 we can also put it in the contour 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.320
 of the eyes hands necks elbows feet 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.180
 Etc. the hat is very comfortable 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 because it has a very soft fabric 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 hair is loose inside and it's like a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.220
 intensive treatment because it will keep 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.220
 the action 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 the oil for more time concentrated in 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 the hair without you giving it watering 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.880
 all the pillow once in bed that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 I can not sleep because you guys 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 they are watching and also because it is daytime 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.830
 but you abstract ok two other 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.190
 accessories and now you are going to laugh 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.560
 of me but try and see they are stockings and 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.480
 gloves like hair look 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.150
 beautiful hands and feet make the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.340
 difference these socks and gloves have 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.800
 more or less the same concept of the hat 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.410
 they do an intensive hydration and or 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.780
 I understand imax and they already come with aloe vera 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.510
 and other moisturizing ingredients but 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 you can place oil or cream 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.720
 of your preference and then put the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.720
 socks or gloves that have 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.979
 as they say in the absence of bread here you know 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.480
 I know it may seem excessive and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.610
 I'm honest is not that every night 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.959
 I go to sleep like that in disguise but 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.480
 when I see that the skin the hair 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.670
 they start to be turned off I turn to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.730
 this type of intensive care and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.319
 believe me the next day you see the difference 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 and I'm going to take advantage to include them in 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.190
 this video a mini tutorial of 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.830
 makeup that I do not upload a while ago 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.239
 and this is a delicate romantic look and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.980
 easy to perform 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.870
 I'm going to be using this new palette of 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.730
 tempered that they like the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.380
 neutral colors are going crazy with 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.209
 this palette sent me several 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.620
 cosmetics and if I have time before 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.019
 leave for which I will make a sun 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.269
 showing them everything and how well you know 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.370
 better always bring raffles so 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.349
 be pending as you see, place the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.780
 white color on the entire eyelid a 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.090
 mallow in the basin and diffuse it towards 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 above and a gray just above the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.140
 basin to accentuate the and give 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.239
 depth to makeup a skin color 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640
 to integrate smoking with the rest of the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.470
 eyelid and that will make the transition 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 softer and the makeup is more 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.370
 curious and finally I picked up the color 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.390
 gray and I put it on the lower eyelid 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.280
 all right 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.860
 eyelashes curled lashes 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 we put on a mask and we go to the face 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.910
 the only thing I'm going to do is put a 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.550
 little bronzer that will serve me 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.500
 blush and as outlined and already happening to 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.900
 the lips I will outline with a pencil 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.459
 flesh color to define the edges and 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.130
 I'm going to put a matte liquid lipstick 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.709
 pink and now I'm going to show you 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.350
 the outfit as I have a camera I do not 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.870
 I tell them and I did not have any desire to 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.220
 take off my hat and I went and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.840
 the truth I like how is the 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.190
 combination you would dare good 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.570
