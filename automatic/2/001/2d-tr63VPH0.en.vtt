00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 The chain decided that I was 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.279
 me prevailing think someone is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 the keypad on the key you do not notice 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.420
 note 9 in note by inch. 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:06.020
 in our view of ccs 00 to do 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:10.250
 these things like that keep secrecy and do not look 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'll try to do here quick or 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:19.100
 easy notebook one detail per detail 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:30.060
 we just need to get a notebook 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:33.380

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.759

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:50.610
 are you think where 17 months reached with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:53.700
 the manager hesitates in haiti where today nothing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 there will be nothing to see the series on 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 Fall went wrong I think the hand followed 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.090
 up close could be six minutes messi 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.050

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.220
 I think the 10 was great our lord 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.150
 our true beauty from here to people 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.520
 in your notebook at the time I thought 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.350

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.980
 on the way it will not be that country 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 most simple of our elder lord 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.400
 so it 's because being funny in class 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:53.450
 until you put the processor that passion 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:03:06.860
 to quit the dull right or lease the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:09.959
 prevalence of apple but it will be the 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.200
