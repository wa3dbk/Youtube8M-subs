little end securely wrapped inside a lot

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.660 
little end securely wrapped inside a lot
then<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.659> sort<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> spin<00:02:01.549> spin<00:02:02.549> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
then you can just sort of spin spin it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.510 
then you can just sort of spin spin it
up<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.829> straw<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.820> kind<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.119> spin<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> up

up the straw just kind of spin it up
spin<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:08.179> spin<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.140> up<00:02:09.550> spinning<00:02:10.550> up<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.120> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
spin it up spin it up spinning up and I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.589 
spin it up spin it up spinning up and I
still<00:02:11.420> have<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.599> going<00:02:12.019> on<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:13.599> spin

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
still have that going on there you spin

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.809 
still have that going on there you spin
it<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.860> can<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.160> kind<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.459> roll<00:02:16.790> it

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
it up you can just kind of roll it

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.759 
it up you can just kind of roll it
around<00:02:17.060> but<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.660> think<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.260> makes<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.560> nice<00:02:18.709> a

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
around but I think it makes a nice a

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.979 
around but I think it makes a nice a
little<00:02:19.160> coil<00:02:19.400> if<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.910> get<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:22.989> spin

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
little coil if you can get it to spin

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.699 
little coil if you can get it to spin
around<00:02:24.049> when<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.739> take<00:02:24.890> your<00:02:24.920> bobby<00:02:25.220> pin<00:02:26.709> like

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
around when you take your bobby pin like

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.009 
around when you take your bobby pin like
a<00:02:27.739> soul<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.760> find<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.150> little<00:02:29.420> hole<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:31.900> put<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
a soul you find a little hole and put it

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.900 
a soul you find a little hole and put it
through<00:02:33.140> everything<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.799> floor<00:02:34.010> great

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.289 

and<00:02:37.910> that's<00:02:38.060> how<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.269> do<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:39.220> straw<00:02:40.220> set<00:02:40.880> you

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
and that's how you do a straw set you

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.750 
and that's how you do a straw set you
just<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.510> your<00:02:41.540> whole<00:02:41.780> head<00:02:41.989> like<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.200> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
just do your whole head like that and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.039 
just do your whole head like that and
once<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.880> get<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> hang<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.510> i<00:02:44.660> think<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
once you get the hang of it i think the

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.949 
once you get the hang of it i think the
front<00:02:45.500> pieces<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.610> should<00:02:46.849> do<00:02:47.000> one<00:02:47.480> at<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.660> time

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
front pieces you should do one at a time

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.509 
front pieces you should do one at a time
you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.319> just<00:02:48.500> put<00:02:48.680> them<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:48.890> one<00:02:49.069> stroke<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
you know just put them on one stroke is

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.830 
you know just put them on one stroke is
going<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.819> be<00:02:49.880> really<00:02:50.030> neat<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.540> then<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
going to be really neat and then the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.839 
going to be really neat and then the
rest<00:02:51.019> of<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.349> you<00:02:51.829> can<00:02:52.010> do<00:02:52.130> like<00:02:52.310> three<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
rest of it you can do like three and

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.020 
rest of it you can do like three and
four<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> straw<00:02:54.190> just<00:02:55.190> grab<00:02:55.519> them<00:02:55.670> together

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
four on a straw just grab them together

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.839 
four on a straw just grab them together
put<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.630> little<00:02:56.840> oil<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.739> grab<00:02:58.099> them<00:02:58.280> it's

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.319 
just these front pieces that you want to
kind<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.680> refine<00:03:01.099> a<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.790> maybe<00:03:02.150> I

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
kind of refine a little bit maybe I

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.110 
kind of refine a little bit maybe I
don't<00:03:02.569> know<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.810> depends<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.739> person<00:03:04.220> but

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
don't know it depends on the person but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.619 
don't know it depends on the person but
nonetheless<00:03:06.910> singles<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> front<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
triples quadruples in the back and what

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.420 
triples quadruples in the back and what
is<00:03:15.109> just<00:03:15.940> chill<00:03:16.940> maestro's<00:03:17.480> down<00:03:17.750> there

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
is just chill maestro's down there
