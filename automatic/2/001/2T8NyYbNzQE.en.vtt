one<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.570> difficulties<00:00:01.140> that<00:00:01.199> schools

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
one of the difficulties that schools

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.379 
one of the difficulties that schools
often<00:00:02.010> have<00:00:02.040> in<00:00:02.429> managing<00:00:02.610> improving

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
often have in managing improving

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.090 
often have in managing improving
behavior<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.350> getting<00:00:04.680> that<00:00:04.770> real

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
behavior is getting that real

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.579 
behavior is getting that real
consistency<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:06.060> place<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.080> we<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.410> that

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
consistency in place and we know that

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.320 
consistency in place and we know that
the<00:00:07.710> more<00:00:07.830> consistent<00:00:08.189> teachers<00:00:08.849> are<00:00:09.000> about

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the more consistent teachers are about

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.120 
the more consistent teachers are about
the<00:00:09.450> systems<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.110> use<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.920> better

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the systems that they use the better

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.879 
the systems that they use the better
behavior<00:00:11.490> gets<00:00:12.230> so<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> developed<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.769> very

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
behavior gets so I developed a very

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
behavior gets so I developed a very
simple<00:00:14.340> checklist<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:15.089> ideas<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.839> schools

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
simple checklist of ideas that schools

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.410 
simple checklist of ideas that schools
can<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.949> adapt<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.340> themselves<00:00:17.730> in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
can use and adapt for themselves in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510 
can use and adapt for themselves in
order<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.289> focus<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> priorities

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
order they can focus on the priorities

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.759 
order they can focus on the priorities
for<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> school<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.930> they<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.650> be

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
for the school that they need to be

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
for the school that they need to be
particularly<00:00:23.160> consistent<00:00:23.820> around<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.840> I'm

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
particularly consistent around and I'm

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.230 
particularly consistent around and I'm
hearing<00:00:25.350> whitehall<00:00:25.740> infants<00:00:26.279> looking<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
hearing whitehall infants looking at the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480 
hearing whitehall infants looking at the
checklist<00:00:27.630> they<00:00:27.779> developed<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.369> how

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
checklist they developed to see how

checklist they developed to see how
that's<00:00:29.670> changed<00:00:30.150> improved<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.289> management

that's changed improved the management

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.310 
that's changed improved the management
of<00:00:31.980> behavior<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> school<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.809> Katy<00:00:34.079> how

of behavior in the school so Katy how
did<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> develop<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.890> checklist<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.489> at

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
did you develop the checklist here at

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
did you develop the checklist here at
Whitehall<00:00:36.090> infants<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:37.170> sat<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
Whitehall infants we sat down with a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.220 
Whitehall infants we sat down with a
small<00:00:38.040> group<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.430> teachers<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:40.110> were

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
small group of teachers and we were

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
small group of teachers and we were
going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> trial<00:00:40.680> their<00:00:40.890> checklist<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.579> our<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
going to trial their checklist in our in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
going to trial their checklist in our in
our<00:00:42.120> classrooms<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.020> we've<00:00:43.590> got<00:00:43.739> lots<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
our classrooms and we've got lots of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
our classrooms and we've got lots of
things<00:00:44.129> embedded<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.610> our<00:00:44.730> school<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.059> terms

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
things embedded in our school in terms

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
things embedded in our school in terms
of<00:00:45.420> behavior<00:00:45.870> at<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> moment<00:00:46.410> anyway<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of behavior at the moment anyway so it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.229 
of behavior at the moment anyway so it
mainly<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.550> matter<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.820> pulling<00:00:48.030> those

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
mainly just a matter of pulling those

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
mainly just a matter of pulling those
things<00:00:48.539> together<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.469> seeing<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.890> things

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
things together and seeing which things

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
things together and seeing which things
are<00:00:50.280> most<00:00:50.489> important<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.329> us<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.989> embed<00:00:52.410> into

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
are most important for us to embed into

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.680 
are most important for us to embed into
our<00:00:52.770> classroom<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.250> Faribault<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.030> how<00:00:54.539> has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
our classroom is Faribault and how has

our classroom is Faribault and how has
this<00:00:54.780> been<00:00:54.840> effective<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.590> improving<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
this been effective in improving and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
this been effective in improving and
managing<00:00:57.059> behavior<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.570> class<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.469> my

class
lots<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> our<00:00:59.850> routines<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.359> already<00:01:00.600> in

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
lots of our routines are already in

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270 
lots of our routines are already in
place<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> does<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:01.890> us<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
place but what it does for us it just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
place but what it does for us it just
reminds<00:01:02.879> us<00:01:03.000> any<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.870> bits<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.409> out

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
reminds us any little bits that are out

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
reminds us any little bits that are out
of<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.979> sink<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:05.580> particularly<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.119> somebody

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
of out sink or particularly if somebody

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
of out sink or particularly if somebody
else<00:01:06.570> comes<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> take<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> class<00:01:07.740> they

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
else comes in to take the class they

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
else comes in to take the class they
know<00:01:08.610> exactly<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.510> exactly<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.260> what

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
know exactly what to do exactly how what

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
know exactly what to do exactly how what
our<00:01:10.590> structures<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.090> goes

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
our structures are and it really goes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
our structures are and it really goes
much<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.780> smoothly<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.740> how<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> be

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
much more smoothly and how would it be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
much more smoothly and how would it be
useful<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.939> other<00:01:15.600> teachers<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.110> other

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
useful for other teachers in other

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
useful for other teachers in other
schools<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.450> be

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
schools do you think I think it could be

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.960 
schools do you think I think it could be
really<00:01:18.600> valuable<00:01:19.159> particularly<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.520> newer

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
really valuable particularly for newer

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
really valuable particularly for newer
teachers<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.930> teachers<00:01:22.080> who<00:01:22.470> are<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
teachers or teachers who are just

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
teachers or teachers who are just
starting<00:01:23.310> off<00:01:23.580> finish<00:01:23.909> school<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.750> really

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
starting off finish school and it really

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
starting off finish school and it really
makes<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.740> consistent<00:01:26.280> across<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.759> school<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
makes it consistent across the school so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
makes it consistent across the school so
it's<00:01:27.600> fantastic<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> terms<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it's fantastic but in terms of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
it's fantastic but in terms of
leadership<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
leadership that they can make sure that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
leadership that they can make sure that
there's<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.170> consistency<00:01:31.770> across<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
there's that consistency across the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.490 
there's that consistency across the
school<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.759> well

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
school as well

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.590 
school as well
because<00:01:34.100> as<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.370> know<00:01:34.400> consistency<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.360> one<00:01:35.510> of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
because as we know consistency is one of

they're lining up order and that's quite

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.930 
they're lining up order and that's quite
visual<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.010> well<00:01:52.070> because<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.400> have<00:01:52.550> it<00:01:52.670> up<00:01:52.820> on

the<00:01:53.030> door<00:01:53.240> he's<00:01:53.690> been<00:01:53.870> able<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.140> see<00:01:54.410> that<00:01:54.620> and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
the door he's been able to see that and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.380 
the door he's been able to see that and
what<00:01:55.340> about<00:01:55.460> line<00:01:55.610> ages<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.940> have<00:01:56.090> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
what about line ages you have the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.850 
what about line ages you have the
attention<00:01:56.660> grabber<00:01:57.050> what<00:01:57.320> was<00:01:57.410> that<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:57.770> of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
attention grabber what was that one of

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.130 
attention grabber what was that one of
them<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.190> we<00:01:58.400> use<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.610> rain<00:01:58.940> stick<00:01:59.330> it's<00:01:59.960> quite

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
them and we use a rain stick it's quite

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.360 
them and we use a rain stick it's quite
effective<00:02:00.230> because<00:02:00.740> you're<00:02:00.830> not<00:02:00.950> using<00:02:01.130> your

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
effective because you're not using your

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:11.170 
effective because you're not using your
voice<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.190> different<00:02:10.520> way<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.820> stopping

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
voice it's a different way of stopping

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.610 
voice it's a different way of stopping
the<00:02:11.270> children<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.260> do<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.560> few

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the children so you just do that a few

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.710 
the children so you just do that a few
times<00:02:12.830> they<00:02:13.520> all<00:02:13.670> have<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.030> looking<00:02:14.420> up<00:02:14.510> at

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
times they all have to be looking up at

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.570 
times they all have to be looking up at
you<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.890> consistent<00:02:16.520> with

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
you and you have to be consistent with

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.699 
you and you have to be consistent with
it<00:02:16.700> as<00:02:16.880> well<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.450> make<00:02:18.290> sure<00:02:18.470> you're<00:02:18.590> always

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
it as well so make sure you're always

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.410 
it as well so make sure you're always
using<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.130> rain<00:02:19.280> stick<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.180> could

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
using the rain stick or you could

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.610 
using the rain stick or you could
alternate<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.050> different<00:02:21.350> for<00:02:21.470> heavy

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
alternate to different for heavy

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.800 
alternate to different for heavy
management<00:02:22.160> strategies<00:02:22.670> yeah<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.420> keep<00:02:23.660> it

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
management strategies yeah but keep it

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.750 
management strategies yeah but keep it
the<00:02:23.900> same
