such<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> great<00:01:42.119> dish<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.110> simplicity

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
such a great dish because the simplicity

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.679 
such a great dish because the simplicity
of<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> number<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.729> most<00:01:45.000> importantly

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of it number one but most importantly

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.080 
of it number one but most importantly
the<00:01:46.140> acidity<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> tomatoes<00:01:47.399> contrast

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the acidity of the tomatoes contrast

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
the acidity of the tomatoes contrast
that<00:01:48.540> sweet<00:01:48.930> fattiness<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.950> pork<00:01:50.310> you
