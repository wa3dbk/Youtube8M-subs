00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
in the past and since she's had Coco I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.720 
in the past and since she's had Coco I
think<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> lot<00:01:28.290> she's<00:01:28.620> been<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:29.010> of<00:01:29.160> hospital

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.700 

something's<00:01:34.330> triggering<00:01:34.900> something<00:01:35.380> for

something's triggering something for

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.820 
something's triggering something for
cocoa<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.220> detect<00:01:36.700> at<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.909> very<00:01:37.120> early<00:01:37.180> stage

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
cocoa to detect at a very early stage
