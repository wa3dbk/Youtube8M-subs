so this is a quick video just showing

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.620 
so this is a quick video just showing
you<00:00:17.369> how<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.609> straightened<00:00:18.179> my<00:00:18.210> daughter's

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
you how I straightened my daughter's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.839 
you how I straightened my daughter's
hair<00:00:18.839> she's<00:00:19.409> gonna<00:00:19.829> be<00:00:20.039> five<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
hair she's gonna be five and it's the

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.390 
hair she's gonna be five and it's the
first<00:00:21.060> time<00:00:21.560> more<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.619> less<00:00:22.650> ever<00:00:23.159> that<00:00:23.310> I've

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
first time more or less ever that I've

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
first time more or less ever that I've
straightened<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.989> that<00:00:24.989> was<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> matter<00:00:25.349> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
straightened it that was a matter of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.259 
straightened it that was a matter of
choice<00:00:25.679> because<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.429> heat<00:00:26.789> tends<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
choice because as you know heat tends to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.389 
choice because as you know heat tends to
damage<00:00:27.569> here<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.739> it's<00:00:28.949> not<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.159> kind<00:00:29.339> of

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
damage here so it's not the kind of

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.739 
damage here so it's not the kind of
thing<00:00:29.519> I'd<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.759> doing<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.089> regular<00:00:30.119> basis

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
thing I'd be doing on a regular basis

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
stuff because that's where you start to

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.150 
stuff because that's where you start to
destroy<00:02:42.349> your<00:02:42.530> hair<00:02:42.709> you're<00:02:42.860> causing

destruction when you do that kind of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.890 
destruction when you do that kind of
stuff<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.940> one<00:02:46.940> swipe<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.660> than<00:02:47.780> enough

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
stuff so one swipe is more than enough

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.960
