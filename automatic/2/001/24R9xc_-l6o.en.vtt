punching your opponent he'll take a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
punching your opponent he'll take a
little<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.370> beating<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> he'll

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
little bit of a beating and he'll

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.880 
little bit of a beating and he'll
immediately<00:00:57.629> tag<00:00:58.230> his<00:00:58.410> partner<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
immediately tag his partner in the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
immediately tag his partner in the
corner<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.520> partner<00:00:59.820> will<00:00:59.940> come<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.300> you'll

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
corner the partner will come out you'll

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
corner the partner will come out you'll
maybe<00:01:00.660> grapple<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.230> him<00:01:01.440> once<00:01:01.649> he'll<00:01:01.920> tag

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
maybe grapple with him once he'll tag

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.340 
maybe grapple with him once he'll tag
his<00:01:02.430> partner<00:01:02.760> again<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.300> it'll<00:01:03.840> shuffle<00:01:04.229> back

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
his partner again and it'll shuffle back

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.179 
his partner again and it'll shuffle back
and<00:01:04.589> forth<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and forth like that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.950 
and forth like that
so<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.519> basically<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.689> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so you're basically in two on one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.490 
so you're basically in two on one
Canadian<00:01:07.409> double<00:01:07.920> situations<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> time

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
Canadian double situations all the time

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
Canadian double situations all the time
the<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.680> feels<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> button<00:01:11.430> masher<00:01:11.970> as

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the game feels like a button masher as

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
the game feels like a button masher as
many<00:01:12.659> grapples<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.439> are<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.950> front

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
many grapples as there are from front

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
many grapples as there are from front
and<00:01:14.340> rear<00:01:14.460> position<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.240> basically

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and rear position you're basically

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
and rear position you're basically
mashing<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> v<00:01:16.770> key<00:01:17.100> beating<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.850> your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
mashing on the v key beating up your

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.490 
mashing on the v key beating up your
opponent<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.630> Irish<00:01:19.080> whip<00:01:19.259> them<00:01:19.439> into

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
opponent you can Irish whip them into

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
opponent you can Irish whip them into
the<00:01:19.740> corner<00:01:20.130> grapple<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.240> perform<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the corner grapple with them perform a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
the corner grapple with them perform a
few<00:01:22.080> moves<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.560> few<00:01:22.740> suplexes<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.939> you're

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
few moves a few suplexes but you're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
few moves a few suplexes but you're
essentially<00:01:24.659> mashing<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> button<00:01:25.830> one

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
essentially mashing on the button one

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
essentially mashing on the button one
strategy<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.210> seems<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.780> exploit<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
strategy that seems to exploit a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.140 
strategy that seems to exploit a
weakness<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> AI<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> can

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
weakness in the AI is that you can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
weakness in the AI is that you can
repeatedly<00:01:30.570> punch<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.200> opponent<00:01:31.560> until<00:01:31.710> he

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
repeatedly punch your opponent until he

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
repeatedly punch your opponent until he
sort<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.220> stumbles<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.759> his<00:01:32.880> feet<00:01:33.119> he<00:01:33.630> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
sort of stumbles on his feet he just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
sort of stumbles on his feet he just
sort<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> flailing<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
sort of flailing around and then you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
sort of flailing around and then you
just<00:01:35.610> walk<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.030> behind<00:01:36.150> him<00:01:36.509> grab<00:01:36.840> him<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
just walk up behind him grab him and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
just walk up behind him grab him and
you'll<00:01:37.710> obviously<00:01:37.829> automatically<00:01:38.670> win<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you'll obviously automatically win the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.069 
you'll obviously automatically win the
grapple<00:01:39.299> you've<00:01:39.479> got<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> weak

grapple you've got them in a weak

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
grapple you've got them in a weak
position<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.310> thing<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> do

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
position but the thing is you can do

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
position but the thing is you can do
this<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.390> many<00:01:42.450> times<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.560> want

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this as many times as you want

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
this as many times as you want
you're<00:01:44.280> basically<00:01:44.610> invulnerable<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you're basically invulnerable in this

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.840
