00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.950
 Galician speaks more but the magdiel objection that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.969
 cdl cdl renato garcia who key is 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.529
 magdiel de canindÃ© no cearÃ¡ makes a video 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.270
 explaining the correct calibration of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.220
 legs to ride on the dirt road 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 there are people who criticize the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.590
 tires that the bike keeps jumping like I do 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 I'll show you the way I think I tire. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 I put 28 in front and here we would pi 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.510
 see how it was then face and soul I 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:51.989
 I will not know how to explain on the road 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:58.079
 floor was that she's okay problem 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:03.359
 will now go 24 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:10.409
 then the use of debut in 2828 in front 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.310
 I will have to explain why and 3332 behind or 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.310
 35 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.320
 I asked my girlfriend to oppose you. 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.320
 here behind right 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.410
 and I'm going to put this guy hot 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 I think he's going to wither like me 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.820
 I'm not getting rain It was not 27 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.820
 it did not work here very dirty speck here I 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.040
 use this calibration is in the city 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:53.170
 both as a croup and as a pitty 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.170
 canada spain again as as alone 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.979
 here only doubt I'll keep here is the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:09.740
 following I have already tested various types of 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:14.470
 calibration and this calm and that the gasoline 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.470
 went wrong and now it has gone 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.689
 the following I was recording that the 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:27.049
 battery is now I already got 32 on the 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:30.049
 front 35 I already got all the 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.959
 All kinds of faces until I take shame on 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.470
 man and I talked to the mototaxi who works 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:43.099
 years ago with this renato following 28 in 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 front maximum 35 back there for beauty 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.959
 Beauty is what he uses to work. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.670
 and never had a problem 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.349
 let's go there because renato was a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.069
 mototaxista had problem 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:59.120
 good guys I had I put a 40 day 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.120
 40 35 in front 40 behind tire bored 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.750
 I am actually in fact based on the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.609
 middle of the road and saw and pa 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.810
 European calibration bored I started 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:13.900
 with the minors 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.590
 the bike got softer it became more 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.889
 You better know it did not pop in the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.010
 always kept until it was time to fall into a 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:28.280
 hole ball looks like it deserves more 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.739
 with this calibration and this is the memory 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.109
 I use to think it's better but 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.650
 Stay and go to the city. 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.720
 I think it's better for the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.030
 ground road because the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.590
 with 10 as in the season there is lots of rock 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.989
 It can not be too hard. 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.870
 it's just going to skip right, so it's like this 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.519
 which I think she will control well 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:56.659
 stones well all then 28 in front and 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.120
 32 behind at most 35 than the world 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.919
 internal and rarely deep into the ground and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.729
 technically I only tested several 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:09.680
 various 3541 optics jumping the bike is bad 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.500
 getting too much curve becomes more dangerous 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.989
 for cuba and that prizes for the anapolina 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 it gets softer the bike on the straight is more 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.919
 soft rush hour always makes lychee 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.700
 better and I recommend that you do not do 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.710
 like I did right now I'm already walking 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.780
 Since morning on the bike, here I am doing 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.970
 order videos 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.290
 and then I went there and it fills up I think the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.990
 It's okay to do that. 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.070
 the right is the following if the bike is well 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.230
 cold, right? 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.889
 You pick up the station closest to your house. 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.930
 because what happens when the tire is 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.220
 warming up he knows 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.800
 cheta on 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.790
 it has happened you see that the tire 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.220
 tahmoush begins to give if it will fill up 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.639
 supported and say 30 he mush from 40 to 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.550
 30 is what happens and his is him 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.430
 it's in there, right? 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:10.370
 so this is always with the cold tires 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:13.850
 I have a cold motorcycle , and another one in every day 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.430
 The day at least in the week speaks like that. 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.210
 every four weeks had a month 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.160
 the four you choose a day to fill 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.410
 11 and Wednesday I chose all 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.320
 Wednesday that you have to appear 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.630
 You go there and fill the roof 11 to anatel 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.550
 do not use the bike only use Thursday 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.830
 every Thursday that you get out of 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.700
 house space to a pit loses a boom 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.250
 local 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.970
 You pick up the bike and this whole fifth. 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.950
 Fair understood this kind put in 28 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.950
 front and 32 behind 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.520
 usually in the motorcycle manual if he 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.680
 netinho shows the calibration of deaths 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.250
 number could not find this page and 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.190
 Why did I even give up? 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.950
 to read but I went I talked with the mototaxi 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.500
 he told me this and really that he 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.600
 has been told so far that it was true that 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.940
 much use to me hope 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.250
 have for you I am sharing this 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.740
 information there if you are in another 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.070
 You can count on me, beauty. 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.710
 so that's it I hope you try your 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.000
 doubt is the way the bike gets soft 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.190
 huh 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.020
 is sometimes your have a result 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.890
 different is only a part a little more 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.760
 heavy 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:35.540
 hence you can consult the manual there and it is 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.250
 That's it folks, it 's the next video 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.050
 If you have any questions , you can 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.620
 comment that we make 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.620
 went
