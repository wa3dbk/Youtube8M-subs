 of the most popular designers of tex 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.600
 who wanted to lend his pencil 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.639
 to the Italian army army 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.950

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.510
 to reiterate that armed forces 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.660
 they also and above all mean peace 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.419
 I was contacted by friends 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.539
 army in the person of the lieutenant 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.150
 Colonel exhibited here beside me who 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:03.360
 through common friendships I must say of 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.910
 common Texan fans have been put on 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.770
 contact I lent myself as well 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.860
 sergio bonelli has made the publishing house 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 publisher to this initiative why not 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.560
 why not attract young people with the idea 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.530
 to give a small gadget a spike 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.479
 the design also learns about the activities 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.770
 of our army and of the missions of 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.289
 peace etc. 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.050
 so much so that I wanted to do some 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.490
 let's say a eulogy of the military that goes 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.500
 in the peace missions these 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.520
 afghanistan 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.770
 during a patrol mission 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.199
 with the helicopter 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.789
 so it's also quite a thing 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.280
 adventurous I must say that it can please 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.419
 also to our comic readers 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.510
 adventure 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.580
 so why not the publishing house 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.310
 and she willingly lent herself to this 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.920
 what i am happy to see so many 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.570
 people here in a row waiting for the 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.580
 drawing so it seems to me that 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.760
 the initiative is doing very well 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.800
 we can say it is the message of tex that 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.870
 he fought the evil we can define it 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.690
 so and can continue with that 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.910
 the army is certainly tex is one 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.740
 personality above the parties but one of his own 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.170
 its moral code and its rightness 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.960
 moral that why not is embodied 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.660
 also from certain values ​​that are with i 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.400
 our military for the day of 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.350
 Saturday is expected to be less 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.890
 nice but so many appointments in 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.110

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.210
 They will still stop more 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.970
 expected of course will be the race of 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.050
 cosplay from 13.00 on the stage of the 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.050
