 the constant ash that emanates from the volcano 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.540
 popocatépetl of recent days has 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.820
 caused that the water received by 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.110
 neighbors of san pedro nexapa and amecameca 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.200

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.430
 material does not work so for the use 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.110
 of the house because it is very dirty 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.200
 so you can not even take 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.890

 yellow as with muddy as at the same time 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.260
 as a quote it was since the beginning of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 activity of the volcano was from the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 day Friday in the early morning because 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 the liquid is not totally drinkable 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.180
 which they receive from the thaws of the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 volcanoes only use it for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.640
 housework look then it is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.030
 leaving all the water yellow here now 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 so we're not going to be going high 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.740
 so that's so if we need water 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.920
 clean to take and for food from 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.049
 Friday goes like this but 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.800
 honestly it is from the volcano of the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.399
 ash that fell because it comes out pink like that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.630
 half what bag you can not use anything 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.909
 more than for not having water as well what 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.729
 we use you for example so that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.300
