00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 jo here i had birthday and the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.370
 Dear Juliet, I got the helm nt 1a here 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.139
 maybe already seen 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
 I already have my last fight 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 used and I have but to the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.350
 possibility the whole now in comparison 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.920
 to test means without podcast that is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.170
 series 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 I have that right there and before 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.170
 all in comparison with my old one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.920
 microphone, the logitech usb microphone stand 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 or no idea what that means specifically 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 was actually quite good but 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 it of course from the price range what 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 totally different 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 at the moment hold me by the normal 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.270
 camera sony alpha 57 so is whole 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 normal microphone is on top of it and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 the same when I take turns taking me 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 hear through the different microphones 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 the two are usb solutions and that there 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.110
 So the nt 1a is such a war hero 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 redemption that goes through the berliner 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 clinic its two usb and that by the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 Whole is as I am this 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.520
 I had picked out a microphone 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.990
 then I had the whole problem 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.270
 Recordings are the whole test shots 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 always made any studios and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.009
 then that has so much rushing and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 that has so many and so yeah okay then 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 does not mean anything funny at all 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.560
 I'm not an audio professional, I think so 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.420
 but not too much and I have 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 but here no disguised mende 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.860
 that means you have a lot of hall or 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 not much but you have some 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.420
 and I 've got the girls' pending and pending 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.700
 I have my mouse clicks here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.530
 and so on and that's why I wanted 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 really such a realistic 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.549
 tests do well for years to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 that at all here 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 if not already such a solution for the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.430
 that's why I'm enough for normal users 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.850
 then do his stages so take revenues 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.420
 Talk about how you actually sound 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.520
 So shots makes for if you 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 speak a blessing once the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.510
 middle shots as well as me 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.810
 usually my gaming recordings 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.600
 do it and for the last time one more 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.000
 Another shot where you can see how 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.320
 very much the room is being recorded because there 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.970
 There are massive differences between 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.890
 the podcast on the internet 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.530
 also because they are already technically 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.900
 but differs well that are quite 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.710
 we do not really go backwards 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.459
 Just let's start with one 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:03:02.590
 Debriefing that rohde nt 1a with 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:03:07.709
 a deep bass vote next 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:19.350
 a debriefing of the broadcaster 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:26.370
 with a lower voice and a normal one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.370
 distance does not speak right into it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 so now we have one last 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.490
 a debriefing of the meeting 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.490
 logitech usb microphones that 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.570
 probably most near 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 have problems and we do one 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:04:00.820
 a little lower so from normal 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.550
 Seating distance should be the logitech 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:09.760
 actually perform quite well 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:13.170
 that my experiences after and again 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.170
 from the space out
