was<00:01:03.789> two<00:01:04.089> before<00:01:04.449> let's<00:01:04.629> try<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.899> again<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
was two before let's try that again one

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.690 
was two before let's try that again one
two<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.510> maybe<00:01:07.810> um<00:01:08.260> this<00:01:09.159> one<00:01:09.310> was<00:01:09.460> sitting

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
two so maybe um this one was sitting

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.490 
two so maybe um this one was sitting
down<00:01:09.970> for<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.240> while<00:01:10.390> maybe<00:01:10.420> yet<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.380> know

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
down for a while maybe yet you know

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.640 
down for a while maybe yet you know
passed<00:01:11.860> its<00:01:12.100> first<00:01:12.159> stage<00:01:12.549> of<00:01:12.580> whatever

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
passed its first stage of whatever

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.710 
passed its first stage of whatever
anyways<00:01:14.650> um<00:01:15.100> if<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.549> ask<00:01:15.670> me<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:16.090> think<00:01:16.450> it'd<00:01:16.689> be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
anyways um if you ask me I think it'd be

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.210 
anyways um if you ask me I think it'd be
fine<00:01:16.930> if<00:01:16.990> they<00:01:17.200> may<00:01:17.439> be<00:01:17.500> just<00:01:17.680> gave<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.010> more

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
fine if they may be just gave you more

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.039

growing<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.880> you'll<00:01:40.390> see<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:41.409> little<00:01:41.530> green

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
growing it you'll see the little green

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.830 
growing it you'll see the little green
sparkles<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.460> place<00:01:42.700> because<00:01:43.210> yeah<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:43.720> have

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
sparkles in place because yeah we have

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.590 
sparkles in place because yeah we have
bone<00:01:44.020> meal<00:01:44.170> inside<00:01:44.439> these<00:01:44.590> dispensers<00:01:45.600> so

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
bone meal inside these dispensers so

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.640 
bone meal inside these dispensers so
pretty<00:01:46.840> much<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.200> same<00:01:47.320> thing<00:01:47.380> as

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
pretty much the same thing as

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.030 
pretty much the same thing as
right-clicking<00:01:48.689> however<00:01:49.689> it's<00:01:50.259> not<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.770> same

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
right-clicking however it's not the same

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.310 
right-clicking however it's not the same
thing<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.640> all<00:01:51.880> scenarios<00:01:52.420> there's<00:01:52.900> seeds

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
thing in all scenarios there's seeds

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.670 
thing in all scenarios there's seeds
inside<00:01:53.860> each<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.970> these<00:01:55.090> things<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.530> it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
inside each of these things but it

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.469 
inside each of these things but it
doesn't<00:01:57.009> grow<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.340> seeds<00:01:57.520> automatically<00:01:58.210> so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
doesn't grow the seeds automatically so

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.480 
doesn't grow the seeds automatically so
it's<00:01:58.750> pretty<00:01:59.439> much<00:01:59.560> based<00:01:59.829> on<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.009> item<00:02:00.310> it's

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
it's pretty much based on the item it's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.770 
it's pretty much based on the item it's
not<00:02:00.610> like<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.850> automatically<00:02:01.240> right<00:02:01.479> clicks

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
not like it automatically right clicks

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.260 
not like it automatically right clicks
for<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.549> there's<00:02:03.700> some<00:02:03.880> other<00:02:04.000> cool

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
was already in there that's why it

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.860 
was already in there that's why it
doesn't<00:02:18.460> work<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:19.360> dying<00:02:19.540> sheep

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
doesn't work for dying sheep

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.780 
doesn't work for dying sheep
automatically<00:02:20.710> just<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.520> didn't<00:02:21.670> work

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
automatically just like it didn't work

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.530 
automatically just like it didn't work
with<00:02:21.880> seeds<00:02:22.150> over<00:02:22.360> there<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.170> can

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540

with seeds over there but you can
through<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> stuff<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:25.900> here<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:26.800> do

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
what's happening here there's a flint

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.070 
what's happening here there's a flint
and<00:02:40.210> steel<00:02:40.330> in<00:02:40.570> there<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.810> i'm<00:02:40.870> clicking

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
and steel in there and i'm clicking

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.270 
and steel in there and i'm clicking
nothing's<00:02:41.500> happening<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.010> might<00:02:42.160> be

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
nothing's happening that might be

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.440 
nothing's happening that might be
because<00:02:42.370> i<00:02:42.550> have<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> button<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.300> face

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
because i have a button on the face

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.770 
because i have a button on the face
let's<00:02:43.660> try<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.900> again<00:02:44.190> there<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:45.400> go<00:02:45.580> yeah<00:02:46.150> okay

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
let's try it again there we go yeah okay

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.380 
let's try it again there we go yeah okay
so<00:02:47.110> that's<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.130> good<00:02:48.280> way<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.490> start<00:02:48.760> fires<00:02:49.060> it'd

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
so that's a good way to start fires it'd

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.890 
so that's a good way to start fires it'd
be<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> really<00:02:49.870> cool<00:02:50.140> way<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.320> think<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:51.070> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
be a really cool way I think to have a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.150 
be a really cool way I think to have a
room<00:02:52.900> or<00:02:53.080> something<00:02:53.230> catch<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.650> fire<00:02:53.860> at<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
room or something catch on fire at the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380 
room or something catch on fire at the
press<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.490> button<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.880> an<00:02:55.030> adventure<00:02:55.360> map

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
press of a button and an adventure map

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.050 
press of a button and an adventure map
now<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.680> fairly<00:02:56.890> easy<00:02:57.160> way<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.459> doing<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
now it's a fairly easy way of doing that

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.730 
now it's a fairly easy way of doing that
rather<00:02:58.270> than<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.810> know<00:02:58.840> putting<00:02:59.290> lava<00:02:59.530> down

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
rather than you know putting lava down

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.380 
rather than you know putting lava down
waiting<00:03:00.190> for<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.550> expand<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.240> can

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
waiting for it to expand but you can

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.930 
waiting for it to expand but you can
also<00:03:01.570> do<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:02.160> T&amp;T<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.459> doesn't<00:03:03.730> make<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
also do it with T&amp;T it doesn't make the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.410 
also do it with T&amp;T it doesn't make the
hissing<00:03:04.209> sound<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.959> will<00:03:05.140> see<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.500> below

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
hissing sound but you will see it below

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.240 
hissing sound but you will see it below
and<00:03:07.420> that's<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.380> really<00:03:08.530> cool<00:03:08.740> function<00:03:09.100> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
and that's a really cool function I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.150 
and that's a really cool function I
think<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.780> what<00:03:11.200> eyes<00:03:11.290> that's<00:03:11.709> that's<00:03:11.980> right

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
think so what eyes that's that's right

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.199 
think so what eyes that's that's right
so<00:03:12.610> over<00:03:12.880> here<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.540> also<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.320> um

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
so over here you can also see that um

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.640 
so over here you can also see that um
having<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.270> dispenser<00:03:16.720> with<00:03:16.870> armor<00:03:17.230> inside<00:03:17.530> of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
having a dispenser with armor inside of

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.440 
having a dispenser with armor inside of
it<00:03:17.770> when<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.190> turn<00:03:18.520> on<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.730> power<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.330> have

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
it when you turn on the power and I have

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.900 
it when you turn on the power and I have
this<00:03:19.540> hooked<00:03:19.660> up<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.550> comparator<00:03:21.550> here<00:03:21.760> so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
this hooked up to a comparator here so

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.759 
this hooked up to a comparator here so
that<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.150> automatically<00:03:22.570> keeps<00:03:22.810> firing<00:03:23.080> so

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
that it automatically keeps firing so

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.259 
that it automatically keeps firing so
what<00:03:23.860> I'm<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.100> do<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.459> get<00:03:24.820> my<00:03:24.850> inventory

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
what I'm going to do is get my inventory

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.120 
what I'm going to do is get my inventory
ready<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.870> look<00:03:26.140> at<00:03:26.260> my<00:03:26.350> armor<00:03:26.680> slots<00:03:26.980> if

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
ready and look at my armor slots if

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.410 
ready and look at my armor slots if
you're<00:03:27.280> standing<00:03:27.610> right<00:03:27.640> next<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.300> you

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
you're standing right next to it and you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.380 
you're standing right next to it and you
turn<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.780> power<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:30.390> automatically

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
turn on the power it automatically

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.710 
turn on the power it automatically
equips<00:03:31.989> armor<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.459> just<00:03:33.940> save<00:03:34.480> little

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
equips armor for you so just save little

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.509 
equips armor for you so just save little
time<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:35.170> can't<00:03:35.350> think<00:03:35.470> about<00:03:35.590> possible

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
time I really can't think about possible

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
time I really can't think about possible
function<00:03:37.000> for<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.830> cool

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
function for that but it's just a cool

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740 
function for that but it's just a cool
little<00:03:39.550> feature<00:03:39.670> they<00:03:40.090> also<00:03:40.209> made<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.570> so

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
little feature they also made it so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.990 
little feature they also made it so
dispensers<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.860> aim<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.790> see<00:03:42.970> here

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
dispensers can aim up like you see here

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.350 
dispensers can aim up like you see here
so<00:03:44.100> shooting<00:03:45.100> up<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.459> also<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.000> same<00:03:46.150> thing

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
so shooting up and also the same thing

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.770 
so shooting up and also the same thing
with<00:03:47.040> droppers<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.310> they<00:03:48.970> can<00:03:49.120> aim<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.570> but

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
with droppers is they can aim up to but

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.910 
with droppers is they can aim up to but
you<00:03:49.840> can<00:03:49.959> see<00:03:50.050> these<00:03:50.140> arrows<00:03:50.470> sitting<00:03:50.739> around

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
you can see these arrows sitting around

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.770 
you can see these arrows sitting around
there's<00:03:51.160> not<00:03:51.310> welcome<00:03:51.940> nothing<00:03:52.300> special<00:03:52.570> you

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
there's not welcome nothing special you

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.360 
there's not welcome nothing special you
can<00:03:52.810> do<00:03:53.019> with<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.470> they<00:03:53.890> also<00:03:54.040> aimed

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
can do with that and they also aimed

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.400 
can do with that and they also aimed
down<00:03:54.670> I've<00:03:55.060> got<00:03:55.209> again<00:03:55.540> dispensers<00:03:56.140> and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
down I've got again dispensers and

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.290 
down I've got again dispensers and
droppers<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:57.400> nothing<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.970> droppers

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
droppers but nothing in the droppers

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.460 
droppers but nothing in the droppers
just<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.570> show<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.840> they<00:03:58.989> can<00:03:59.110> turn<00:03:59.260> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
just to show you that they can turn a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.590 
just to show you that they can turn a
dispenser<00:04:00.160> however<00:04:00.489> as<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.760> bunch<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.330> tegan

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
dispenser however as a bunch of tegan

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.810 
dispenser however as a bunch of tegan
tate<00:04:01.750> inside<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.280> we'll<00:04:03.519> see<00:04:03.670> how<00:04:03.700> this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
tate inside of it so we'll see how this

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.589 
tate inside of it so we'll see how this
turns<00:04:03.970> out

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.750 

next<00:04:08.599> up<00:04:08.750> record<00:04:09.650> blocks<00:04:09.950> they<00:04:10.189> made<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.579> so

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
next up record blocks they made it so

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.369 
next up record blocks they made it so
that<00:04:10.939> the<00:04:10.969> number<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.959> record

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
that the number of the record

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.500 
that the number of the record
corresponds<00:04:13.129> to<00:04:13.219> the<00:04:13.340> output<00:04:13.790> power<00:04:13.969> of<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
corresponds to the output power of the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.810 
corresponds to the output power of the
comparator<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:16.400> doesn't<00:04:16.699> make<00:04:16.759> sense

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
comparator so it doesn't make sense

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.819 
comparator so it doesn't make sense
right<00:04:17.209> now<00:04:17.269> but<00:04:17.419> let<00:04:17.690> me<00:04:17.720> show<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:17.959> music<00:04:18.709> is

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
right now but let me show you music is

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.039 
right now but let me show you music is
13<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.669> first<00:04:19.880> one<00:04:20.090> cat<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.750> second

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
13 is the first one cat is the second

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.499 
13 is the first one cat is the second
one<00:04:21.169> blocks<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.889> third<00:04:22.070> one<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.850> we'll<00:04:23.180> to

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
one blocks is the third one so we'll to

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.379 
one blocks is the third one so we'll to
take<00:04:24.110> these<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.650> order<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:25.699> will<00:04:26.060> see

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
take these in order and you will see

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.390 
take these in order and you will see
that<00:04:26.720> because<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.530> first<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.130> gives

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
that because it's the first one it gives

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.320 
that because it's the first one it gives
one<00:04:29.240> redstone<00:04:29.750> worth<00:04:30.110> of<00:04:30.229> charge<00:04:30.470> cat<00:04:31.430> now

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
one redstone worth of charge cat now

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.420 
one redstone worth of charge cat now
gives<00:04:32.630> two<00:04:32.960> redstone<00:04:33.289> worth<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.830> charge<00:04:34.100> and

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
gives two redstone worth of charge and

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.090 
gives two redstone worth of charge and
what's<00:04:34.759> just<00:04:34.820> fart<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:35.600> think<00:04:35.840> blocks<00:04:36.500> blocks

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
what's just fart I think blocks blocks

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.620 
what's just fart I think blocks blocks
gives<00:04:37.460> three<00:04:37.759> because<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.180> third<00:04:38.330> disk

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
gives three because it's the third disk

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.659 
gives three because it's the third disk
so<00:04:39.169> this<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.590> cool<00:04:39.800> way<00:04:40.009> you<00:04:40.070> could<00:04:40.370> make<00:04:40.520> it

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
so this is a cool way you could make it

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.219 
so this is a cool way you could make it
so<00:04:40.820> whatever<00:04:41.090> record<00:04:41.599> someone<00:04:41.810> puts<00:04:42.050> in

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
so whatever record someone puts in

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.110 
so whatever record someone puts in
charges<00:04:43.099> and<00:04:43.340> say<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.520> have<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:43.880> get<00:04:44.000> one

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
charges and say you have to get one

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.379 
charges and say you have to get one
specific<00:04:44.570> record<00:04:44.930> in<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:46.310> case<00:04:46.370> wait<00:04:47.000> one<00:04:47.360> of

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
specific record in this case wait one of

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.029 
specific record in this case wait one of
the<00:04:47.479> newer<00:04:47.599> ones<00:04:48.130> only<00:04:49.130> wait<00:04:50.000> as<00:04:50.380> record<00:04:51.380> will

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
the newer ones only wait as record will

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.490 
the newer ones only wait as record will
open<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.520> door<00:04:52.669> back<00:04:52.910> there<00:04:53.139> because<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.410> is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
open that door back there because it is

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.230 
open that door back there because it is
the<00:04:54.590> only<00:04:54.710> one<00:04:54.919> that<00:04:54.979> charges<00:04:55.520> 12<00:04:55.789> blocks<00:04:56.000> of

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
the only one that charges 12 blocks of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.930 
the only one that charges 12 blocks of
redstone<00:04:56.539> so<00:04:57.320> that's<00:04:57.889> a<00:04:58.099> fun<00:04:58.310> little<00:04:58.460> way<00:04:58.610> of

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
redstone so that's a fun little way of

half stones for normal and sandstone
normal<00:05:19.070> this<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.250> what<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.400> normal<00:05:19.639> smooth

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
commands they're still in a way of

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.779 
commands they're still in a way of
getting<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.110> in<00:05:27.229> creative<00:05:27.680> right<00:05:27.860> now<00:05:28.010> but<00:05:28.699> if

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
getting it in creative right now but if

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.610 
getting it in creative right now but if
you're<00:05:28.909> familiar<00:05:29.000> with<00:05:29.270> Kip<00:05:29.570> commands<00:05:30.289> that's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
you're familiar with Kip commands that's

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.060 
you're familiar with Kip commands that's
the<00:05:30.770> way<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.919> do<00:05:31.070> it<00:05:31.479> last<00:05:32.479> up<00:05:32.750> on<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.229> list<00:05:33.470> is

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
the way to do it last up on the list is

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.730 
the way to do it last up on the list is
that<00:05:34.330> items<00:05:35.330> are<00:05:35.599> I<00:05:35.630> guess<00:05:35.780> not<00:05:36.080> very<00:05:36.349> last<00:05:36.560> up

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
that items are I guess not very last up

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.140 
that items are I guess not very last up
at<00:05:36.830> last<00:05:37.010> thing<00:05:37.159> I<00:05:37.220> can<00:05:37.370> really<00:05:37.460> illustrate<00:05:38.000> is

at last thing I can really illustrate is

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.830 
at last thing I can really illustrate is
items<00:05:39.020> are<00:05:39.280> monsters<00:05:40.280> are<00:05:40.430> afraid<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:41.150> mine

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
items are monsters are afraid of mine

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
he's just gonna stay in the middle

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.089 
he's just gonna stay in the middle
however<00:06:05.270> if<00:06:05.479> we<00:06:05.630> were<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:06.020> give<00:06:06.229> him<00:06:06.409> an<00:06:06.620> option

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
however if we were to give him an option

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.279 
however if we were to give him an option
to<00:06:07.280> get<00:06:07.430> out<00:06:07.610> of<00:06:07.880> here<00:06:08.030> somehow<00:06:08.330> he<00:06:09.110> would

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
to get out of here somehow he would

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.930 
to get out of here somehow he would
eventually<00:06:09.380> decide<00:06:10.099> he<00:06:10.310> wants<00:06:10.340> to<00:06:10.639> go<00:06:10.729> right

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
eventually decide he wants to go right

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.210 
eventually decide he wants to go right
here<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:11.389> then<00:06:11.479> he'll<00:06:11.870> path<00:06:12.409> find<00:06:12.680> his<00:06:12.860> way<00:06:12.979> up

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
here and then he'll path find his way up

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.909 
here and then he'll path find his way up
there<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:14.750> they<00:06:14.990> also<00:06:15.169> threw<00:06:15.500> some<00:06:15.710> other

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
there so they also threw some other

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.260 
there so they also threw some other
things<00:06:16.279> in<00:06:16.460> here<00:06:16.610> that<00:06:16.669> are<00:06:16.820> kind<00:06:17.060> of<00:06:17.090> hard<00:06:17.180> to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
things in here that are kind of hard to

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.679 
things in here that are kind of hard to
illustrate<00:06:17.690> this<00:06:17.779> really<00:06:18.080> this<00:06:18.200> bug

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
illustrate this really this bug

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.489 
illustrate this really this bug
but<00:06:18.929> I<00:06:18.959> think<00:06:19.139> they're<00:06:19.259> fairly<00:06:19.589> major<00:06:20.009> so<00:06:20.519> um

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499 
but I think they're fairly major so um

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:23.689 
but I think they're fairly major so um
other<00:06:22.499> people<00:06:22.799> won't<00:06:22.889> really<00:06:23.099> probably<00:06:23.489> talk

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
other people won't really probably talk

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.129 
other people won't really probably talk
about<00:06:23.939> them<00:06:24.089> but<00:06:24.209> I<00:06:24.269> wanted<00:06:24.509> to<00:06:24.569> say<00:06:24.779> a<00:06:24.809> few<00:06:24.869> of

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
about them but I wanted to say a few of

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.959 
about them but I wanted to say a few of
them<00:06:25.259> they<00:06:25.889> made<00:06:26.219> it<00:06:26.339> so<00:06:26.459> you've<00:06:26.580> stopped

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
them they made it so you've stopped

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.609 
them they made it so you've stopped
losing<00:06:27.179> your<00:06:27.419> achievements<00:06:27.989> after<00:06:28.229> updates

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:28.619 
losing your achievements after updates

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.319 
losing your achievements after updates
so<00:06:28.889> that's<00:06:29.069> of<00:06:29.219> minor<00:06:29.429> inconvenience<00:06:29.759> finally

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:30.329 
so that's of minor inconvenience finally

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:32.749 
so that's of minor inconvenience finally
out<00:06:30.449> of<00:06:30.479> the<00:06:30.599> way<00:06:30.889> floating<00:06:31.889> water<00:06:32.129> no<00:06:32.429> longer

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 
out of the way floating water no longer

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.989 
out of the way floating water no longer

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
drags the player in creative mode

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.489 
drags the player in creative mode
another<00:06:35.999> little<00:06:36.299> annoying<00:06:36.659> thing<00:06:36.959> they<00:06:37.110> fixed

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:37.499 
another little annoying thing they fixed

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:40.189 
another little annoying thing they fixed
chests<00:06:38.399> no<00:06:38.549> longer<00:06:38.849> stay<00:06:39.179> opened<00:06:39.749> when

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
chests no longer stay opened when

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.209 
chests no longer stay opened when
they're<00:06:40.319> not<00:06:40.409> open<00:06:40.559> anymore<00:06:40.739> that<00:06:41.099> was<00:06:41.189> a

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:41.219 
they're not open anymore that was a

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:43.129 
they're not open anymore that was a
small<00:06:41.489> glitch<00:06:41.729> they<00:06:41.909> fixed<00:06:42.179> and<00:06:42.360> boats<00:06:42.959> and

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
small glitch they fixed and boats and

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.199 
small glitch they fixed and boats and
mine<00:06:43.349> carts<00:06:43.679> no<00:06:43.860> longer<00:06:44.189> drop<00:06:44.519> when<00:06:44.849> destroyed

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
mine carts no longer drop when destroyed

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:46.609 
mine carts no longer drop when destroyed
and<00:06:45.329> creative<00:06:45.659> actually<00:06:45.929> I<00:06:45.959> can't<00:06:46.199> illustrate

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.619 
and creative actually I can't illustrate

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:50.149 
and creative actually I can't illustrate
that<00:06:48.289> so<00:06:49.289> let's<00:06:49.499> see<00:06:49.589> if<00:06:49.649> this<00:06:49.739> works<00:06:49.860> for<00:06:49.979> mine

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
that so let's see if this works for mine

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.219 
that so let's see if this works for mine
carts<00:06:50.369> with<00:06:50.489> hoppers<00:06:51.029> for<00:06:51.809> this<00:06:51.929> right<00:06:52.050> here<00:06:52.199> I

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
carts with hoppers for this right here I

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.409 
carts with hoppers for this right here I
guess<00:06:52.469> and<00:06:52.709> yes<00:06:53.579> when<00:06:53.849> you're<00:06:53.969> in<00:06:54.089> creative

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
guess and yes when you're in creative

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:55.969 
guess and yes when you're in creative
mode<00:06:54.449> it<00:06:54.689> no<00:06:54.809> longer<00:06:54.959> just<00:06:55.199> drops<00:06:55.589> them<00:06:55.829> they

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
mode it no longer just drops them they

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.100 
mode it no longer just drops them they
just<00:06:56.159> disappear<00:06:56.639> so<00:06:56.879> a<00:06:57.059> small<00:06:57.449> annoying<00:06:57.929> thing

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
just disappear so a small annoying thing

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.139 
just disappear so a small annoying thing
that<00:06:58.259> they<00:06:58.349> finally<00:06:58.619> fixed<00:06:58.829> also<00:06:59.729> a<00:06:59.759> says<00:06:59.999> in

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:00.149 
that they finally fixed also a says in

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:03.049 
that they finally fixed also a says in
the<00:07:00.239> chains<00:07:00.509> log<00:07:00.829> popper<00:07:01.829> minecart<00:07:02.489> behave

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:03.059 
the chains log popper minecart behave

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:05.029 
the chains log popper minecart behave
like<00:07:03.419> they<00:07:03.599> are<00:07:03.659> on<00:07:03.719> powered<00:07:04.349> activated<00:07:04.860> rail

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
like they are on powered activated rail

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.369 
like they are on powered activated rail
even<00:07:05.399> if<00:07:05.489> they<00:07:05.579> never<00:07:05.610> touched<00:07:06.029> one<00:07:06.269> but<00:07:07.079> if

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
even if they never touched one but if

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.139 
even if they never touched one but if
you<00:07:07.409> recall<00:07:07.739> from<00:07:07.979> my<00:07:08.129> last<00:07:08.339> video<00:07:08.699> it<00:07:09.059> was

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:09.149 
you recall from my last video it was

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.529 
you recall from my last video it was
accepting<00:07:09.689> items<00:07:10.169> before<00:07:10.499> it<00:07:11.429> ever<00:07:11.789> touched

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
accepting items before it ever touched

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:13.999 
accepting items before it ever touched
the<00:07:12.719> activator<00:07:13.079> rail<00:07:13.259> and<00:07:13.469> it's<00:07:13.589> still<00:07:13.739> doing

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
the activator rail and it's still doing

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.129 
the activator rail and it's still doing
so<00:07:14.129> here<00:07:14.339> so<00:07:14.909> I<00:07:15.179> don't<00:07:15.419> know<00:07:15.479> exactly<00:07:15.899> what

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 
so here so I don't know exactly what

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.809 
so here so I don't know exactly what
that's<00:07:16.259> about<00:07:16.529> but<00:07:16.589> I'm<00:07:17.099> presuming<00:07:17.489> it's

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 
that's about but I'm presuming it's

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:18.769 
that's about but I'm presuming it's
probably<00:07:18.089> a<00:07:18.179> feature<00:07:18.360> they're<00:07:18.539> going<00:07:18.659> to<00:07:18.719> be

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:18.779 
probably a feature they're going to be

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:21.019 
probably a feature they're going to be
changing<00:07:19.489> possibly<00:07:20.489> a<00:07:20.549> few<00:07:20.699> more<00:07:20.789> times

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:21.029 
changing possibly a few more times

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.759 
changing possibly a few more times
before<00:07:21.179> 1.5<00:07:21.869> comes<00:07:22.139> out<00:07:22.289> so<00:07:22.409> I'm<00:07:22.499> not<00:07:22.589> going<00:07:22.709> to

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:22.769 
before 1.5 comes out so I'm not going to

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:24.259 
before 1.5 comes out so I'm not going to
worry<00:07:22.919> about<00:07:22.979> the<00:07:23.189> dynamics<00:07:23.369> of<00:07:23.729> it<00:07:23.849> quite<00:07:24.239> yet

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:24.269 
worry about the dynamics of it quite yet

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:27.079 
worry about the dynamics of it quite yet
