00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.780
 Hi, I'm Eduardo RodrÃ­guez and in this 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.100
 video I want to talk about the steps of 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.100
 Dominant thinking 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.120
 the dominant thoughts that you 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.250
 we wake up attention 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.830
 we see it as something that we see as something 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
 true 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 thoughts that we have frequently 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.789
 things that we talk about frequently 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.280
 things that we affirm very firmly 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.829
 that generates a feeling every time 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.199
 that we talk about it because it becomes 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.300
 in something very important to us are 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.670
 the dominant thoughts that we 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.609
 we have 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.070
 so what we live our reality 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.650
 external is what manifests 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.010
 manifests itself in a physical way of what 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.730
 we have practiced very often 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.680
 we are about to say it somehow 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.520
 boxed without moving from these 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.830
 beliefs 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.040
 when we spend our time thinking about 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.650
 what we need that is what it does 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.140
 that expands in our reality is what 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.740
 that reaches us are the channels that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.070
 we keep active wanting something in this 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.140
 moment 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 that we do not have and focus our 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.090
 attention to what is not in what is not 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.330
 we have is to make the law of attraction 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 keep responding to that vibration of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 shortage continuing without obtaining that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.440
 we want to get rid of with scarcity 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.380
 we will continue to obtain the same 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.260
 the thoughts of satisfaction are a 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.960
 technique that consists in refusing 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.450
 categorically and definitely to admit everything 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.760
 thought of fear or failure before 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.090
 anything and on the contrary use 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.990
 our will and creativity to 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.000
 sustain thoughts continuously 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.659
 of happiness success 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 and personal satisfaction 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.429
 so you get to import for nothing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.039
 what may be happening in the 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.400
 external world 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.490
 the thoughts really are 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.330
 Harmless 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.880
 is that we stick to them 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.680
 We believe they are true and not the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.810
 let's go 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.209
 it is not our thoughts that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.010
 they really cause us suffering but 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.750
 rather the attachment to the same thought 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 to make it constant 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.920
 walking 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.290
 we stick to a thought because 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.470
 we believe it is true and we do not stop 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.910
 to investigate a little about him 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.910
 we just believe it 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.820
 in this way beliefs are born and a 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 belief is a thought to which 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.030
 we have been clinging 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.470
 a long time that we have turned it into 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.850
 dominant in a dominant thought of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.850
 our mind in a belief 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.020
 the vast majority of thoughts that 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.590
 we have 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.670
 they are not ours but that they have 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.490
 been transmitted by other people 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.620
 for a culture or the medium in which 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.049
 we live above all the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.150
 the media 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.459
 thoughts come from the sea are 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.519
 like clouds moving through 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.180
 a clear sky are always in step 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.890
 through our mind 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.360
 quality has no interest in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.280
 stay therefore 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.910
 they are not police 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.800
 what happens is that actually 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.170
 it becomes 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.010
 in poisonous and dangerous to our 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.590
 mind when we get attached to them like 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.900
 if they were a great truth 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.260
 without realizing it, we end up 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.590
 turning them into our reality 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.720
 we can really 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.550
 with our thoughts is 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.490
 understand them and try to think 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.650
 because we want to get closer to once 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.400
 we begin to see a painful concept 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.310
 with understanding and love begins to lose 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.940
 good and we can free ourselves 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.940
 more and more 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.759
 the problem is that our mind 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.860
 is quite trained to hold on to 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.689
 very often intensity to the 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.580
 negative thoughts to all that 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:30.590
 that causes us suffering and disturbs us 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.330
 allowing them to become constant and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.729
 dominate 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.880
 being later quite difficult 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.250
 get free of them 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.740
 in the same way that it was created 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.200
 the negative dominant thought in 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.820
 our mind unconsciously without 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.860
 that we have realized it 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.140
 Now we can create new thoughts 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.080
 now you know how to create new 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.689
 positive and dominant thoughts 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.569
 who believes in well-being in your life 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.119
 in pizza is a process that we can 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.939
 perform in a directed manner maintained 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:04.720
 sustained and consciously about 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.730
 all 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.710

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.130

 negative dominants 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.030
 in positive dominant thoughts 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.390
 I want to know
