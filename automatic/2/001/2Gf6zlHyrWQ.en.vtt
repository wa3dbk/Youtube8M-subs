make<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.259> your<00:01:42.530> own<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.829> you<00:01:43.070> can<00:01:43.280> holes<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.700> it

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
make it your own and you can holes in it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.639 
make it your own and you can holes in it
attach<00:01:44.570> studs<00:01:44.929> do<00:01:45.170> whatever<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.500> hell<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
attach studs do whatever the hell you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.560 
attach studs do whatever the hell you
want<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.070> make<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.369> yours<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.299> there's<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> nice

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
want to make it yours so there's a nice

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.569 
want to make it yours so there's a nice
DIY<00:01:47.929> aesthetic<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.770> she<00:01:48.920> was<00:01:49.039> after<00:01:49.189> and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
DIY aesthetic that she was after and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.450 
DIY aesthetic that she was after and
that<00:01:50.569> really<00:01:50.720> got<00:01:50.869> us<00:01:50.990> excited<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:51.979> inspired

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
that really got us excited it's inspired

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.710 
that really got us excited it's inspired
the<00:01:52.670> exam<00:01:52.850> in<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.149> we'd<00:01:53.299> be<00:01:53.479> able<00:01:53.569> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the exam in that we'd be able to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.319 
the exam in that we'd be able to
actually<00:01:54.110> make<00:01:54.560> almost<00:01:55.399> like<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.880> if<00:01:56.030> we<00:01:56.240> were

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
actually make almost like as if we were

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.609 
actually make almost like as if we were
creating<00:01:56.630> studs<00:01:56.899> for<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.350> thing<00:01:57.500> would

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
creating studs for this thing would

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.160 
creating studs for this thing would
create<00:01:57.920> these<00:01:58.039> bespoke<00:01:58.520> LED<00:01:58.939> parts<00:01:59.390> which<00:01:59.990> we

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
create these bespoke LED parts which we

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.929 
create these bespoke LED parts which we
would<00:02:00.289> then<00:02:00.469> fix<00:02:00.829> directly<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.549> jacket

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
would then fix directly to the jacket

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.910 
would then fix directly to the jacket
using<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.810> know<00:02:02.840> using<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.380> wire<00:02:03.619> as<00:02:03.890> a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
using you know using the wire as a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.889 
using you know using the wire as a
feature<00:02:04.219> making<00:02:04.789> sure<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:05.179> everything<00:02:05.630> is

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
feature making sure that everything is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.680 
feature making sure that everything is
as<00:02:06.170> visible<00:02:06.590> as<00:02:06.649> as<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.220> needs<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.849> be<00:02:08.000> we<00:02:08.539> had

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
as visible as as it needs to be we had

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.559 
as visible as as it needs to be we had
the<00:02:08.959> LEDs<00:02:09.830> fixed<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.819> jacket<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.450> all

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
the LEDs fixed to the jacket in all

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.199 
the LEDs fixed to the jacket in all
sorts<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.840> interesting<00:02:12.019> ways<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:13.130> each<00:02:13.760> ring

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
sorts of interesting ways the each ring

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.509 
sorts of interesting ways the each ring
in<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.480> case<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.959> actually<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.519> controllable

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
in this case is actually a controllable

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.190 
in this case is actually a controllable
pixel<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.150> we<00:02:17.239> can<00:02:17.390> brighten<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.780> term<00:02:18.019> that

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
pixel so we can brighten in term that

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500 
pixel so we can brighten in term that
entire<00:02:18.560> ring<00:02:18.860> as<00:02:19.010> one<00:02:19.280> single<00:02:19.549> pixel<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
entire ring as one single pixel then the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.729 
entire ring as one single pixel then the

what<00:02:22.099> we<00:02:22.190> ended<00:02:22.549> up<00:02:22.640> doing<00:02:22.700> was<00:02:22.970> we've<00:02:23.329> written

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
what we ended up doing was we've written

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.789 
what we ended up doing was we've written
a<00:02:23.599> piece<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.750> software<00:02:24.049> which<00:02:24.200> allows<00:02:24.319> us<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
a piece of software which allows us to

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.160 
a piece of software which allows us to
focus<00:02:24.829> a<00:02:25.400> specific<00:02:26.239> series<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.599> frequencies

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
focus a specific series of frequencies

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
focus a specific series of frequencies
on<00:02:27.470> specific<00:02:28.010> areas<00:02:28.099> of<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> jacket<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
on specific areas of the jacket the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.110 
on specific areas of the jacket the
thing<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:30.549> differentiates<00:02:31.549> this<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> course

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
thing that differentiates this of course

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.520 
thing that differentiates this of course
is<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.450> we're<00:02:32.720> very<00:02:32.750> lucky<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.380> a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
is that we're very lucky to have a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.400 
is that we're very lucky to have a
pretty<00:02:34.250> powerful<00:02:34.430> processing<00:02:35.269> system<00:02:36.260> we've

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
pretty powerful processing system we've

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.979 
pretty powerful processing system we've
got<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.639> alt<00:02:37.639> rock<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.030> there<00:02:38.209> which<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.450> doing

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
got a alt rock in there which is doing

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.110 
got a alt rock in there which is doing
all<00:02:39.109> the<00:02:39.200> heavy<00:02:39.290> lifting<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:40.430> had<00:02:40.579> this<00:02:40.760> really

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
all the heavy lifting we had this really

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.240 
all the heavy lifting we had this really
interesting<00:02:41.269> time<00:02:41.840> constraints<00:02:42.380> associated

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
interesting time constraints associated

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.280 
interesting time constraints associated
with<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> challenge<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.209> creating<00:02:44.780> this

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
with the challenge of creating this

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.930 
with the challenge of creating this
design<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:46.400> Christian<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:49.519> meant

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
design with Christian and the that meant

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.059 
design with Christian and the that meant
we<00:02:50.180> were<00:02:50.299> able<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.600> sort<00:02:50.870> explore<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
we were able to sort explore the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.080 
we were able to sort explore the
potential<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.760> verbal<00:02:53.750> electronics<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:55.030> as<00:02:56.030> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
potential of verbal electronics and as a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.879 
potential of verbal electronics and as a
prototype<00:02:56.389> so<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.019> could<00:02:57.170> see<00:02:57.470> whether<00:02:57.739> or<00:02:57.829> not

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
prototype so we could see whether or not

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.430 
prototype so we could see whether or not
this<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.100> actually<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.489> feasible<00:02:59.480> design

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
this is actually a feasible design

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.780 
this is actually a feasible design
solution<00:03:00.920> where<00:03:01.069> we<00:03:01.190> were<00:03:01.280> coming<00:03:01.519> up<00:03:01.609> with

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
solution where we were coming up with

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.640 
solution where we were coming up with
and<00:03:02.090> how<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.720> all<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.170> challenges<00:03:03.380> that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and how it's all the challenges that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:17.680 
and how it's all the challenges that
Christian<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:04.760> set<00:03:04.970> us<00:03:05.120> essentially

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:28.380 

Oh

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.800 

Oh
