00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.800
 It is a station and a device 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.610
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 tee 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:25.070
 The ic card for riding does not respond well to the automatic ticket gate 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.730
 It was subjected to re-reading machine boarding card by station staff 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.730
 This man 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.059
 The anger is bumped against a stationer who has no fault 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:44.060
 When another passenger who heard the yell breaks in 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.060
 goo 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 goo 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.940
 Suddenly beaten up 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 Unlawfully exercise the power of nature that directly or indirectly causes deep to pain towards the human mind 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:15.050
 It is an assault to do 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:19.570
 The act that surprised men by the dangers of this man and the gains and losses they get is clearly assaulted 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.570
 It is a crime to be established 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.090
 It keeps on becoming unknown with your behavior 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.090
 me 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.210
 car 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 uh 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.770
 Now for the station staff who support the item size 4 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.440
 What 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.070
 me 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.570
 Where is your train home 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 Scream and guide 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560
 goo 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.690
 me 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.290
 me 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:21.330
 Is this man drunk? 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:30.800
 But unilateral Australian force to selfish thoughtless words and the good faith of a third party to Beijing and are not intended to be forgiven 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.800
 Such assaults in public places should normally be charged with the police 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.720
 When the man left, the station staff confirmed that it was good for the beaten passenger not to call the police. 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.569
 It seems 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:55.709
 It is a station member whose correspondence is sincere 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:03:05.629
 Luckily this passenger keen and the beaten passenger showed a calm response but to such others 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:05.629
 It is a dangerous and vicious act that could lead to an injury case if one mistake of violence or violence was made 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.280
 And a gas-going and gimmicks 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.750
 Hmm 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.750
 ana
