a<00:00:00.030> 3d<00:00:00.930> driving<00:00:01.380> simulation<00:00:01.979> on<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.370> Genesis

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
a 3d driving simulation on the Genesis

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.210 
a 3d driving simulation on the Genesis
well<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.570> isn't<00:00:03.899> gonna<00:00:04.020> work<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.589> gonna<00:00:05.009> be

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
well this isn't gonna work it's gonna be

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.460 
well this isn't gonna work it's gonna be
just<00:00:05.490> like<00:00:05.640> hard<00:00:06.330> driving<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.140> mean<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
just like hard driving I mean the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.350 
just like hard driving I mean the
framerate<00:00:08.010> it's<00:00:08.280> gonna<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.610> horrible<00:00:08.849> it's

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
framerate it's gonna be horrible it's

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.730 
framerate it's gonna be horrible it's
gonna<00:00:09.480> be<00:00:09.630> hard<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> control<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.500> gonna

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
gonna be hard to control it just gonna

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.499 
gonna be hard to control it just gonna
be<00:00:10.800> an<00:00:10.950> awful<00:00:11.370> game<00:00:11.580> well<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.090> was<00:00:12.330> actually

be an awful game well I was actually
pleasantly<00:00:13.049> surprised<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> 3d

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
pleasantly surprised this is a 3d

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.180 
pleasantly surprised this is a 3d
driving<00:00:15.509> racing<00:00:15.839> simulation<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.619> Genesis

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
driving racing simulation on the Genesis

driving racing simulation on the Genesis
that<00:00:17.340> actually<00:00:18.060> kind<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.630> works<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.260> mean<00:00:19.439> it's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
that actually kind of works I mean it's

that actually kind of works I mean it's
actually<00:00:20.400> fun<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.449> hard<00:00:21.930> driving

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
actually fun this is not hard driving

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.670 
actually fun this is not hard driving
the<00:00:23.220> cars<00:00:23.519> handle<00:00:24.330> pretty<00:00:24.689> well<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> game

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
the cars handle pretty well and the game

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.029 
the cars handle pretty well and the game
has<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.099> classic<00:00:26.910> 16-bit<00:00:27.599> Genesis<00:00:28.560> music

sleep this is a 3d driving game for the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
sleep this is a 3d driving game for the
Genesis<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:36.180> into

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
Genesis that you can actually get into

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.240 
Genesis that you can actually get into
and<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.260> racing<00:00:37.800> against<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
and it's not just racing against the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
and it's not just racing against the
clock<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.850> race<00:00:39.360> against<00:00:39.780> opponents

clock you can race against opponents

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560 
clock you can race against opponents
that<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> actually<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.329> gameplay

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that you actually see in the gameplay

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
that you actually see in the gameplay
and<00:00:43.050> also<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> avoid<00:00:44.460> traffic

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and also you have to avoid traffic

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
and also you have to avoid traffic
either<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.719> towards<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.530> traffic

either going towards you or traffic

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
either going towards you or traffic
that's<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:48.000> lane<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.809> top<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> all

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that's in your lane and on top of all

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
that's in your lane and on top of all
that<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:49.739> cop<00:00:50.219> cars<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> various

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that there's cop cars in the various

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
that there's cop cars in the various
places<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.260> drive<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
places you drive in that you have to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
places you drive in that you have to
avoid<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.570> only<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:55.140> they're<00:00:55.350> coming

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
avoid and the only reason they're coming

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
avoid and the only reason they're coming
after<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:57.030> young<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
after you is because you're young and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.439 
after you is because you're young and
16-bit<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> actual<00:00:59.340> foreground<00:00:59.699> where

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
16-bit now the actual foreground where

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
16-bit now the actual foreground where
you<00:01:00.600> play<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> 3d<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you play the game is 3d but the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
you play the game is 3d but the
background<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.539> still<00:01:03.809> picture<00:01:04.080> but

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
background is just a still picture but

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
background is just a still picture but
that's<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> complaint<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> cool

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's not a complaint I think it's cool

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's not a complaint I think it's cool
the<00:01:07.080> levels<00:01:07.409> are<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:07.740> enough<00:01:08.640> where<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the levels are very enough where you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
the levels are very enough where you
actually<00:01:09.750> don't<00:01:09.990> feel<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.380> you're<00:01:10.560> driving

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
actually don't feel like you're driving

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.580 
actually don't feel like you're driving
around<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.610> same<00:01:11.939> exact<00:01:12.390> place<00:01:12.659> over<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
around the same exact place over and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
around the same exact place over and
over<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.250> while<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> levels<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.119> different

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
over now while the levels are different

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
over now while the levels are different
in<00:01:15.630> terms<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.020> aesthetic<00:01:16.500> properties<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in terms of aesthetic properties the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.520 
in terms of aesthetic properties the
cars<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.360> handle<00:01:18.960> differently

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
cars don't actually handle differently

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
cars don't actually handle differently
into<00:01:20.009> several<00:01:20.610> different<00:01:20.850> levels<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
into several different levels in the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
into several different levels in the
game<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.990> you're<00:01:22.140> driving<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
game like if you're driving around a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
game like if you're driving around a
forest<00:01:23.880> place<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.869> car<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.500> handle

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
forest place your car is gonna handle

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.920 
forest place your car is gonna handle
exactly<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> same<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.479> you're<00:01:27.659> driving

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
exactly the same as when you're driving

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
exactly the same as when you're driving
around<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> place<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.220> more<00:01:29.490> arid

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
around the place that that's a more arid

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
around the place that that's a more arid
desert<00:01:30.540> environment<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.130> there

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
desert environment and just like there

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.830 
desert environment and just like there
are<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> few<00:01:32.610> different<00:01:33.090> levels<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.630> also

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
are a few different levels there's also

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
are a few different levels there's also
a<00:01:33.990> few<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.680> cars<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
a few different cars which all have

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.690 
a few different cars which all have
different<00:01:36.750> interiors<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.280> gonna<00:01:38.430> feel

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
different interiors so you're gonna feel

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
different interiors so you're gonna feel
like<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:39.150> driving<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.900> different<00:01:40.020> car<00:01:40.290> at

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like you're driving a different car at

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
like you're driving a different car at
least<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:40.979> look<00:01:41.250> different<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:41.759> they

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
least it's gonna look different but they

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.660 
least it's gonna look different but they
all<00:01:42.299> handle<00:01:42.600> about<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.530> same<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
all handle about the same which is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
all handle about the same which is
exactly<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.840> you'd<00:01:45.990> expect<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.680> game<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
exactly what you'd expect from a game of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.130 
exactly what you'd expect from a game of
that<00:01:47.130> era<00:01:47.399> let's<00:01:47.790> enjoy<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> pizza<00:01:48.720> we're

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that era let's enjoy the pizza we're

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.749 
that era let's enjoy the pizza we're
eating<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
eating right now and not think about a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.319 
eating right now and not think about a
pizza<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.720> toppings<00:01:52.399> now<00:01:53.399> unlike<00:01:53.880> hard

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
pizza with more toppings now unlike hard

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
pizza with more toppings now unlike hard
driving<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> Genesis<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
driving for the Genesis this is not a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.819 
driving for the Genesis this is not a
port<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:57.149> an<00:01:57.360> arcade<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.409> one

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
port from an arcade I think that's one

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
port from an arcade I think that's one
of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> main<00:01:59.250> reasons<00:01:59.790> hard<00:02:00.390> driving<00:02:00.780> wasn't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
of the main reasons hard driving wasn't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
of the main reasons hard driving wasn't
that<00:02:01.320> good<00:02:01.680> they<00:02:01.890> took<00:02:02.399> something<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.000> works

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that good they took something that works

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.630 
that good they took something that works
on<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> completely<00:02:04.079> different<00:02:05.009> system<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
on a completely different system the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.059 
on a completely different system the
arcade<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.780> course<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.649> delude

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
arcade and of course that can delude

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
arcade and of course that can delude
things<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.759> mean<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.270> moving<00:02:09.810> games<00:02:10.080> from

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
things I mean I think moving games from

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.670 
things I mean I think moving games from
the<00:02:10.739> arcades<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.700> home<00:02:12.030> console<00:02:12.660> isn't<00:02:13.379> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the arcades to a home console isn't like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.390 
the arcades to a home console isn't like
regular

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
regular

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.729 
regular
cooking<00:02:14.970> it's<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.659> baking<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
cooking it's more like baking the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.309 
cooking it's more like baking the
proportions<00:02:17.579> have<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.939> be<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:19.079> you

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
proportions have to be just right you

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.160 
proportions have to be just right you
have<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> in<00:02:20.189> a<00:02:20.280> calculated<00:02:20.939> way<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
have to do it in a calculated way so the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.170 
have to do it in a calculated way so the
frame<00:02:22.530> rate<00:02:22.769> doesn't<00:02:23.159> suffer<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.760> sound

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
frame rate doesn't suffer the sound

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.789 
frame rate doesn't suffer the sound
effects<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.720> suffer<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> gameplay

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
effects don't suffer the gameplay

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.770 
effects don't suffer the gameplay
ultimately<00:02:26.280> doesn't<00:02:26.730> suffer<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.329> think<00:02:27.659> that's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
ultimately doesn't suffer I think that's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.229 
ultimately doesn't suffer I think that's
one<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.140> reasons<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.799> 3d<00:02:29.430> driving<00:02:29.939> game

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
one of the reasons this 3d driving game

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.140 
one of the reasons this 3d driving game
is<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.959> good<00:02:31.620> because<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:32.280> wasn't<00:02:32.670> taken

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
is actually good because it wasn't taken

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
is actually good because it wasn't taken
from<00:02:33.359> somewhere<00:02:33.870> else<00:02:33.900> where<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:35.069> could

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
from somewhere else where it could

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
from somewhere else where it could
perform<00:02:35.819> better<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.359> was<00:02:36.480> made<00:02:36.780> specifically

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
perform better it was made specifically

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.429 
perform better it was made specifically
for<00:02:38.209> various<00:02:39.209> home<00:02:39.510> consoles

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
for various home consoles

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.830 
for various home consoles
in<00:02:40.769> terms<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> game's<00:02:42.090> graphical

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
in terms of the game's graphical

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.170 
in terms of the game's graphical
properties<00:02:43.409> it's<00:02:43.650> not<00:02:43.829> that<00:02:44.250> impressive<00:02:44.879> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
properties it's not that impressive I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.930 
properties it's not that impressive I
mean<00:02:45.480> yes<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.049> does<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.650> good<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.280> love<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
mean yes it does look good I love the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
mean yes it does look good I love the
fact<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.629> view<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.109> from<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.889> interior

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
fact that the view is from the interior

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.789 
fact that the view is from the interior
of<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.879> car<00:02:51.209> you're<00:02:51.810> actually<00:02:52.290> moving<00:02:52.470> the

of the car you're actually moving the

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.860 
of the car you're actually moving the
wheel<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.370> see<00:02:53.400> all<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.879> numbers<00:02:54.120> moving

wheel you see all the numbers moving
around<00:02:55.139> you<00:02:55.680> see<00:02:55.889> how<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.190> fuel<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.730> have

around you see how much fuel you have
you<00:02:57.090> see<00:02:57.299> how<00:02:57.780> fast<00:02:58.109> you're<00:02:58.379> going<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:59.040> see

you see how fast you're going you see

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640 
you see how fast you're going you see
the<00:02:59.459> gear<00:02:59.700> stick<00:02:59.849> it's<00:03:00.269> fantastic<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.470> like

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the gear stick it's fantastic it's like

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.009 
the gear stick it's fantastic it's like
an<00:03:01.829> honest-to-god<00:03:02.549> simulation<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.450> an<00:03:03.599> actual

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
an honest-to-god simulation of an actual

an honest-to-god simulation of an actual
driving<00:03:04.739> racing<00:03:05.549> game<00:03:05.909> but<00:03:06.629> it's<00:03:06.780> actual<00:03:07.099> 3d

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
driving racing game but it's actual 3d

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.309 
driving racing game but it's actual 3d
aspects<00:03:08.760> are<00:03:08.879> not<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.420> impressive<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
aspects are not that impressive in the

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.770 
aspects are not that impressive in the
slightest<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:11.040> lot<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.549> racing<00:03:12.030> games<00:03:12.239> from

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
slightest a lot of racing games from

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.470 
slightest a lot of racing games from
that<00:03:12.959> particular<00:03:13.170> era<00:03:13.859> had<00:03:14.280> graphics<00:03:14.970> much

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that particular era had graphics much

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.720 
that particular era had graphics much
like<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.129> thing<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.489> makes

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
like this I think the thing that makes

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.140 
like this I think the thing that makes
this<00:03:18.030> game<00:03:18.299> stand<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.019> most<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.500> this

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
this game stand out the most is this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.720 
this game stand out the most is this
fantastic<00:03:21.150> interior<00:03:22.139> view<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.220> turn<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
fantastic interior view you turn the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.309 
fantastic interior view you turn the
lights<00:03:24.000> off<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.510> your<00:03:24.660> room<00:03:24.870> while<00:03:25.139> you're

lights off in your room while you're

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.500 
lights off in your room while you're
playing<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.769> at<00:03:25.980> night<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.849> feel<00:03:27.269> like

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
playing this at night and you feel like

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.259 
playing this at night and you feel like
you're<00:03:27.720> actually<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.859> world<00:03:29.129> drive<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
you're actually in the world drive it

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.869 
you're actually in the world drive it
around<00:03:30.620> avoiding<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.799> cops<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.519> all<00:03:32.699> the
