left-hand side of the ipad which is kind
of<00:02:27.739> unusual<00:02:27.890> i<00:02:28.459> thought<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.540> would<00:02:29.599> be<00:02:29.810> on

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
of unusual i thought that it would be on

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.940 
of unusual i thought that it would be on
the<00:02:30.200> top<00:02:30.860> however<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.910> can<00:02:31.940> see<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.769> is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the top however you can see that this is

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.330 
the top however you can see that this is
the<00:02:34.099> plastic<00:02:35.090> bezel<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.690> will<00:02:36.110> allow<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.830> to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the plastic bezel that will allow you to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.070 
the plastic bezel that will allow you to
have<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.420> better<00:02:38.959> 3g<00:02:39.590> coverage<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:40.250> course<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
have a better 3g coverage of course the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.130 
have a better 3g coverage of course the
aluminum<00:02:42.099> casing<00:02:43.099> would<00:02:44.000> most<00:02:44.480> likely<00:02:44.720> block

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
aluminum casing would most likely block

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140 
aluminum casing would most likely block
the<00:02:45.590> cell<00:02:45.950> reception<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.120> our

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
the cell reception so we have our

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.569
