00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.430 
Smurfs tropical fish however I used the
hand<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.480> back<00:02:23.540> proteins<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.140> go<00:02:24.230> there

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
hand on the back proteins to go there

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.380 
hand on the back proteins to go there
that<00:02:25.280> was<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.550> time<00:02:25.730> they<00:02:25.880> were<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.090> roughly

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
that was the time they were in roughly

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.199 
that was the time they were in roughly
about<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.690> year<00:02:27.430> had<00:02:28.430> their<00:02:28.610> tank<00:02:28.819> set<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
about a year had their tank set up as a

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.479 
about a year had their tank set up as a
marine<00:02:29.480> tank<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:34.130> was<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
marine tank and this this was the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.350 
marine tank and this this was the
holding<00:02:34.790> tank<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.360> transferred<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.440> into<00:02:37.360> you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
holding tank I transferred them into you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.670 
holding tank I transferred them into you
see<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.630> not<00:02:38.720> fully<00:02:38.989> broken<00:02:39.110> down<00:02:39.350> yet<00:02:39.530> it's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
see it's not fully broken down yet it's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.140 
see it's not fully broken down yet it's
just<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.010> 20<00:02:40.489> gallon<00:02:42.640> tropical<00:02:43.640> fish<00:02:43.819> tank<00:02:43.850> as

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
just a 20 gallon tropical fish tank as

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.759 
just a 20 gallon tropical fish tank as
well<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:46.069> used<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.120> internal<00:02:47.540> filter<00:02:48.050> on

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
well with I used the internal filter on

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.259 
well with I used the internal filter on
that<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.819> tank<00:02:53.030> as<00:02:53.180> I

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
that one so that that was the tank as I

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.610 
that one so that that was the tank as I
mentioned<00:02:53.569> before<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.380> was<00:02:54.470> extremely

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
mentioned before that I was extremely

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.190 
mentioned before that I was extremely
high<00:02:54.980> nitrites<00:02:55.550> when<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.390> tested<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> water<00:02:56.989> is

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
high nitrites when I tested the water is

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.370 
high nitrites when I tested the water is
roughly<00:02:58.510> no<00:02:59.510> point<00:02:59.780> 5<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.290> 1<00:03:01.000> ppm<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.380> nitrites

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
roughly no point 5 to 1 ppm of nitrites

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.160 
roughly no point 5 to 1 ppm of nitrites
in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.739> water<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.299> decided<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:06.019> had<00:03:06.049> to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
in the water so I decided I had to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.800 
in the water so I decided I had to
transfer<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.880> fish<00:03:08.060> back<00:03:08.329> into<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> live

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
transfer the fish back into the live

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.319 
transfer the fish back into the live
rock<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:10.250> live<00:03:10.400> rock<00:03:10.610> was<00:03:10.850> kept<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
rock the live rock was kept in a

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.500 
rock the live rock was kept in a
separate<00:03:11.660> tub<00:03:12.760> which<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.880> an<00:03:13.940> oven<00:03:14.150> breakdown

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
separate tub which is an oven breakdown

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
separate tub which is an oven breakdown
all<00:03:14.660> see<00:03:14.810> as<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.980> current<00:03:16.340> tank<00:03:16.549> so

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
all see as it's in the current tank so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.240 
all see as it's in the current tank so
that's<00:03:17.299> just<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.720> quick<00:03:18.110> add-on<00:03:18.530> here<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:19.040> show

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
that's just a quick add-on here to show

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.220 
that's just a quick add-on here to show
where<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.150> fish<00:03:20.450> are<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.600> holding<00:03:20.989> they're<00:03:21.140> in

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
the holding tank for about two weeks and

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.300 
the holding tank for about two weeks and
that<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.380> previous<00:03:24.709> thing<00:03:24.860> before<00:03:25.160> which

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
that was the previous thing before which

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.009 
that was the previous thing before which
is<00:03:25.430> now<00:03:25.549> fully<00:03:25.820> broken<00:03:26.060> down<00:03:26.329> just<00:03:26.840> needs

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
is now fully broken down just needs

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.440 
is now fully broken down just needs
cleaning<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.970> it'll<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.030> put<00:03:29.150> up<00:03:29.299> for<00:03:29.329> sale<00:03:31.450> ok
