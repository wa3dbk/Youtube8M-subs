00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.180
 What 's up, beauty people? 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.600
 I did the little brillo and the sixteen brinkley 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.360
 commented and the black ops 2 this time 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.320
 tomorrow stands and there is more nuclear there 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.270
 I got it this time it was with msc 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.250
 I think the third nuclear room that 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.140
 I have with her says the third she 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.200
 I was getting there multi tim with fashion there 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.300
 that I had played once and saw that 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.670
 it was easy to get caught in the crÃ¡ssico 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.789
 cras playing muffin and I came back to play 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.219
 with my friends they say that they only have three 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.199
 high in part with three only there never play 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.359
 a large hall staff the fla randy 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.699
 bridge the normal trash we have played 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.739
 quite multi had a very good man 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.440
 never easy to sing nuclear 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.690
 a lot of people think it's not good for 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.870
 nuclear issue and such because they are three in 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.729
 every team and such but it is much better because 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.280
 the response with the best I know you 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.770
 Can you take it and I could get this 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.050
 nuclear and you went very fast 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.470
 we did not think it was too fast 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.270
 at the time when I was playing I 'm there 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.720
 thinking about starting a new series for 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 the channel a trough series had on mp3 a 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.820
 little different than nuclear 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.160
 all the guns a lot of people have been asking 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.900
 this at the beginning of the game was not 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.290
 wanting to bring this which is something that 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.320
 I'll bring it, I'll try a series 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.880
 that I can do and get nuclear with 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.440
 every weapon is a very difficult thing 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.450
 machine gun was proposed in this 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.320
 video on Thursday photographing here 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.300
 on the fourth I already picked up the a ach with the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.880
 danger to koch with a time in 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.720
 all 17 victor shih with the MSC and the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.420
 w 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.490
 so that's it machine gun went well 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.470
 do where I will start now with 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.250
 these hearings and I 'll see how it goes 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.409
 That's what I 'm being told, I do not think it's going to be 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.680
 so difficult but coming into being 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.840
 hipers a shock but I do not know which one 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.090
 Come on before I think this is great. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 to that in which it is of four shots 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.620
 the name is m is in something me 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 so transmitted for every four shots 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.800
 and turn but I know it's going to be okay 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.530
 difficult then I do not know if I can 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.269
 but I'm not going to leave the series . 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.980
 with all weapons will be 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.930
 starting here on Thursday next 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.180
 probably s 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.549
 Nothing bad happens on Thursday that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.349
 come already topou rained episode 1 I said 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.819
 be serious about it with all the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.530
 and I got the bike with all the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.170
 the weapons were but thirty-something 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.980
 episodes and such I'll're trying here 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.680
 post it all and it's every Thursday a 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.220
 the second episode continued there with 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.280
 rtd and I'll see it I can get it 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.569
 with all weapons is the video 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.970
 in a moment you will're running out I'm coming 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.890
 catch nuclear soon, then I hope 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.890
 You liked this video more 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.590
 nuclear there is worthy of bridge on the map 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.890
 plaza and maybe some friends that I and today 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.049
 we got there then if they liked the company 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.620
 do not forget to leave a like leave 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.940
 A favorite is follow on twitter if 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.590
 subscribe to the channel to help 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.440
 disclosure and such is what I have already 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.000
 brutal to be the brutal line and I 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.859
 I'm going to get nuclear and come back calm and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.019
 four on the floor to kill me 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.260
 while trying to catch a tube into cloves 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:42.230
 I still have not even got faith track there. 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.139
 nuclear power and I am happy to 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.459
 environmental time is but I will go 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.230
 Soon you will see that I 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.239
 I'll get the bridge will stay up there. 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.819
 or go up there to that stretched go 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.030
 get a triple kioshi and the eni and go 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.440
 to get nuclear after a 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 It is a very good way to get 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400
 gets much point that happened in the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.180
 table everything responds capture not 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
 responds 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.230
 I arrived with a bonus, right? 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.819
 You can win seven points and has 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.970
 so I see a lot of people going by 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.250
 Then the shooting world changes to nqm forever. 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.100
 otherwise it will be good and it will end up in law 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.610
 guys go my 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.610
 the yo-yo
