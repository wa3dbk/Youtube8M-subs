00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
what's up everyone if you've ever worked

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.439 
what's up everyone if you've ever worked
on<00:00:01.949> your<00:00:02.159> scooter<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.850> know<00:00:02.939> there's<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.210> big

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
on your scooter you know there's a big

mess in vacuum hoses attached to the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.369 
mess in vacuum hoses attached to the
engine<00:00:05.370> it'd<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.180> nice<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.690> have<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.140> many

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
engine it'd be nice not to have so many

engine it'd be nice not to have so many
today<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.040> will<00:00:08.250> show<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.670> minimum<00:00:09.120> number

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
today I will show you the minimum number

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.629 
today I will show you the minimum number
of<00:00:09.480> hoses<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.110> need<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.250> scooter<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
of hoses that you need in this scooter I

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.270 
of hoses that you need in this scooter I
removed<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.330> EGR<00:00:12.840> system<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.679> evaporative

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
removed the EGR system the evaporative

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.150 
removed the EGR system the evaporative
emissions<00:00:14.400> system<00:00:15.230> replaced<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.500> stock<00:00:16.920> air

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
emissions system replaced the stock air

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.820 
emissions system replaced the stock air
filter<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> foam<00:00:18.090> filter<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.779> remove<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
filter with a foam filter and remove the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.640 
filter with a foam filter and remove the
fuel<00:00:20.070> safety<00:00:20.490> shutoff<00:00:20.670> valve<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:22.170> fuel<00:00:22.439> goes

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
fuel safety shutoff valve the fuel goes

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
fuel safety shutoff valve the fuel goes
from<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> tank<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> fuel<00:00:23.760> filter<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
from the tank to the fuel filter the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
from the tank to the fuel filter the
safety<00:00:25.470> valve<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:26.160> leaking<00:00:26.519> gas<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> took

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
safety valve was leaking gas so I took

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.380 
safety valve was leaking gas so I took
it<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.519> other<00:00:29.519> end<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> fuel<00:00:30.240> hose

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
it out the other end of the fuel hose

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.150 
it out the other end of the fuel hose
goes<00:00:30.660> straight<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> carburetor<00:00:31.679> where

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
goes straight into the carburetor where

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.979 
goes straight into the carburetor where
the<00:00:32.309> fuel<00:00:32.579> inlet<00:00:33.059> valve<00:00:33.329> controls<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:33.930> much

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the fuel inlet valve controls how much

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.119 
the fuel inlet valve controls how much
gas<00:00:34.320> gets<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:35.540> remove<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> EGR<00:00:37.020> valve<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
gas gets in remove the EGR valve and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
gas gets in remove the EGR valve and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
valve cover has a vent this is called

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
valve cover has a vent this is called
positive<00:00:45.930> crankcase<00:00:46.320> ventilation

positive crankcase ventilation

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360 
positive crankcase ventilation
this<00:00:48.030> takes<00:00:48.300> fuel<00:00:49.230> vapors<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:49.920> past<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this takes fuel vapors that get past the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.990 
this takes fuel vapors that get past the
piston<00:00:50.760> rings<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> current<00:00:52.620> case

attach<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> hose<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.520> comes

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
attach the hose to that and that comes

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
attach the hose to that and that comes
up<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> one-way<00:00:57.829> positive<00:00:58.829> crankcase

ventilation valve goes into a hose and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.210 
ventilation valve goes into a hose and
then<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> feed<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.339> into<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.630> air<00:01:06.840> filter

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
then I feed that into the air filter

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
then I feed that into the air filter

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
emission system has a lot of back and
forth<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.820> lot<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> valves<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> usually<00:02:01.530> after

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
forth a lot of valves and usually after

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.250 
forth a lot of valves and usually after
a<00:02:01.770> couple<00:02:01.950> you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
a couple you

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.980 
a couple you
most<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.010> those<00:02:03.100> don't<00:02:03.370> work<00:02:03.610> correctly<00:02:04.030> so

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
most of those don't work correctly so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.030 
most of those don't work correctly so
they'll<00:02:05.170> interfere<00:02:05.620> with<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.860> way<00:02:05.980> the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
they'll interfere with the way the

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.660 
they'll interfere with the way the
engine<00:02:06.400> runs<00:02:06.640> by<00:02:07.000> having<00:02:07.390> vacuum<00:02:07.870> leaks<00:02:08.080> by

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
engine runs by having vacuum leaks by

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.100 
engine runs by having vacuum leaks by
messing<00:02:09.670> with<00:02:09.700> air<00:02:09.940> fuel<00:02:10.330> ratio<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.900> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
messing with air fuel ratio and the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.570 
messing with air fuel ratio and the
mission<00:02:11.410> system<00:02:11.560> actually<00:02:12.010> makes<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
mission system actually makes the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.730 
mission system actually makes the
missions<00:02:12.910> worse<00:02:13.210> so<00:02:13.990> by<00:02:14.170> removing<00:02:14.470> this

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
missions worse so by removing this

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.860 
missions worse so by removing this
system<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.400> think<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.850> scooter<00:02:16.210> runs<00:02:16.450> smooth

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
system I think the scooter runs smooth

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.340 
system I think the scooter runs smooth
and<00:02:17.320> clean

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.440 

you
