00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.230
 certain flashing the flashlight direction use 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
 this safety signage is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.449
 and make use of it is not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.980
 free but must look to people 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 The importance of the correct 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.309
 fundamental is every time that the driver 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.920
 It was change of track. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 must use the arrow so much that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.809
 communication today is that the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.030
 driver has with the other drivers right 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 today they are part of the design of the car 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.010
 many draw your attention wherever you go 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.890
 but many only lino admire them and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 forget to use them your driver makes 30 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 Only years I do not forget the use of the arrow 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 it is something simple and elementary and what 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 few know is that the position of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.990
 steering wheel can do all the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 then the correct position for the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.650
 We always have such power using the arrow 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 is always ensures the steering with both 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.979
 hands are usually with the left hand 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 You trigger the arrow is when they made the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 conversion of left or when 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.380
 make a position to the right and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.689
 signaling system has evolved 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 along with the cars now hits the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.579
 my part on the sides of the mirrors 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 of vehicles is more and more sure 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.240
 she is being of the utmost importance 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.979
 because in older vehicles they do not 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.150
 have some on the side 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.030
 so when he came he wanted to make a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 The driver 's conversion is hardly a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.130
 driver who was traveling today 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 can see that with this new technology 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 also including arrows on the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 mirrors also which is also more 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.460
 easy to identify a possible conversion 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.320
 for those who forget to use the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 arrow a reminder if you keep wanting it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 can even mount or use arrow it is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.329
 a serious violation foreseen in the ctb which is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.390
 the Brazilian traffic code then 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.280
 This is so essential here in our 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.230
 municipality and cities 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 bigger but worse than forgetting the arrow is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.660
 accidents that lack of it may 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660
 cause
