00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.520
 I'm here with the second video from my channel 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.350
 and the second video the clash of silence 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 As I said in the first video I would 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.349
 making this video of the center of the village 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.960
 maximized by going to level four 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.960
 And how can you see here? 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 This is my village, it's all busy in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 Level 3 maximum 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:36.480
 and then when the globe here on level 2 and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.870
 the tone to the center of the village for 4 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.910
 and this right layout and this strategy 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.539
 defense of appeal 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:59.000
 That's what I did if you want this. 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:01:01.829
 copying is what you can copy and it's also 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.400
 she helped me a lot with the resources 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.600
 neither defend the resources nor defend the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.159
 gold elixer that are important for good 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 the Pope all the village and Mass for the day 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:27.619
 cheerleading galley has been eight giants is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 one is pure white and west fronts 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 this strategy has helped a lot 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:40.200
 because I put the giant inside and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 archers go around destroying 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 all 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.810
 and I've been able to take away 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 enough resources from other players to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.149
 to be able to refresh my life right? 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.770
 and one thing I wanted is talking 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.860
 For you, I recommend you guys. 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 to update ávila at the latest for later 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.700
 Dick center of the village because in my 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.060
 opinion is the best way to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.509
 said the Pope 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.509
 and also 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.499
 and in the center of the village was for 3 and now 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.469
 let's upgrade and you can leave the second 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.999
 goal at level four at the most 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.989
 as soon as the village center is 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:31.500
 level 4 with everything updated I'll do 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.980
 another video for you to show a 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:41.700
 idea that I have in common which 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.239
 better just saw it and I hope you have 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.079
 liked the strategy of attack with 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.829
 and defense strategy 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.540
 I for you who have not seen the first 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.760
 channel video I'm leaving the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.680
 liquid in the description and to watch 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.879
 so I'll be better at recording the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.040
 my videos leave a comment that 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.480
 helped to sign up and not to lose 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.879
 More video is because I'm doin ' 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.189
 now as soon as upa is finished 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.310
 I'll move everything to the maximum without 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.199
 buy things from the store and then I 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.019
 I'm going to buy things from the store. 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:27.889
 I will put everything in a field and only they upa 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.299
 Which I think is the best way later. 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:36.209
 I'll put everything together and it will be fine 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:41.280
 so I hope I have improved on 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:45.259
 recording my videos to help 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.599
 You there with these ideas that I have 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:54.109
 in the game 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:56.609
 that's it then hopefully my channel 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.139
 This is the first video here. 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:03.150
 The Village Center Level 3 Defense And Attack 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:06.180
 and I do not know yet the name I'm going to give 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.219
 this video but then you can be 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.049
 watching the first video and 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:17.130
 Maybe I improved on channel recording. 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:21.659
 I hope the video is less repetitive. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.270
 It's tiring and only then until the next 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.270
 video galé 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 thanks
