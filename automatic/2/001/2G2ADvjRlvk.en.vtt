00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.449 
of here okay but we did clean that up
same<00:02:57.000> way<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:58.560> piece<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.920> look<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
same way this piece you look in the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.580 
same way this piece you look in the
previous<00:02:59.880> video<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.540> not<00:03:03.660> completely<00:03:04.410> done

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
previous video it's not completely done

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.850 
previous video it's not completely done
yet

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
yet

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.670 
yet
we<00:03:05.549> took<00:03:05.700> her<00:03:05.850> file<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.680> different

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
we took her file to it different

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150 
we took her file to it different
directions<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.120> suggest<00:03:10.080> made<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> in

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
directions and just suggest made it in

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.310 
directions and just suggest made it in
the<00:03:11.250> jaws<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.730> Vice<00:03:11.930> with<00:03:12.930> different

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the jaws of the Vice with different

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.600 
the jaws of the Vice with different
directions<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.480> flatten<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.500> out<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.400> we're

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
directions and flatten that out so we're

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.520 
directions and flatten that out so we're
gonna<00:03:17.700> reuse<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.660> could<00:03:18.930> made<00:03:19.170> one<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.470> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
gonna reuse this I could made one on a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.820 
gonna reuse this I could made one on a
piece<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:19.890> brass<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:21.570> did<00:03:22.260> buy<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> piece<00:03:22.799> of

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
piece of brass I did buy a piece of

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.800 
piece of brass I did buy a piece of
browse<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.489> don't<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> mill<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.630> could

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
browse I don't have a mill but I could

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.250 
browse I don't have a mill but I could
have<00:03:24.900> copied<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.320> good<00:03:25.680> enough<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:27.260> little

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
have copied just good enough a little

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.229 
have copied just good enough a little
step<00:03:28.650> might<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:29.040> hard<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> do<00:03:31.640> there<00:03:32.640> get<00:03:33.060> back

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
step might be hard to do there get back

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.130 
step might be hard to do there get back
in<00:03:33.420> here<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.870> light

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
in here in the light

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.020 
in here in the light
okay<00:03:36.140> we'll<00:03:36.530> pause<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.220> we'll<00:03:37.370> show<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.910> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
okay we'll pause and we'll show just a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400 
okay we'll pause and we'll show just a
few<00:03:38.060> more<00:03:38.390> things<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.960> then<00:03:39.080> we'll<00:03:39.170> have<00:03:39.380> some

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
few more things and then we'll have some

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.830 
few more things and then we'll have some
pictures<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.470> episode<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.630> we<00:03:44.630> don't

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
pictures on this episode and we don't

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.940 
pictures on this episode and we don't
know<00:03:44.990> if<00:03:45.080> we're<00:03:45.230> gonna<00:03:45.290> show<00:03:45.590> how<00:03:45.710> we're<00:03:45.860> gonna

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
know if we're gonna show how we're gonna

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.680 
know if we're gonna show how we're gonna
make<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.160> bushing<00:03:46.580> in<00:03:46.820> this<00:03:46.940> episode<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:47.570> we

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
make this bushing in this episode so we

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.270 
make this bushing in this episode so we
really<00:03:47.990> don't<00:03:48.080> know<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:48.440> how<00:03:48.620> far<00:03:48.950> we<00:03:49.100> get

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
really don't know it's how far we get

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.610 
really don't know it's how far we get
today<00:03:49.460> but<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:50.840> thought<00:03:51.020> I'd<00:03:51.200> showed<00:03:51.470> how

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
today but I just thought I'd showed how

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.500 
today but I just thought I'd showed how
I<00:03:51.650> cleaned<00:03:52.070> up<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.250> part<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:53.090> piece<00:03:53.330> of

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
I cleaned up the part like piece of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.070 
I cleaned up the part like piece of
sanding<00:03:53.870> block<00:03:55.210> like<00:03:56.210> say<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.510> want<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.900> get

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
sanding block like say you want to get

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.850 
sanding block like say you want to get
in<00:03:59.410> somewhere<00:04:00.410> up<00:04:00.620> against<00:04:01.010> an<00:04:01.130> edge<00:04:02.860> like

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
in somewhere up against an edge like

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.540 
in somewhere up against an edge like
here<00:04:05.110> no<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.770> want<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.040> get<00:04:07.190> right<00:04:07.370> in

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
here no so you want to get right in

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.930 
here no so you want to get right in
there<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.240> stay<00:04:08.510> along<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.930> edge<00:04:09.940> looks

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
there and stay along that edge looks

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.690 
there and stay along that edge looks
pretty<00:04:11.210> good<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:12.040> we're<00:04:13.040> not<00:04:13.130> really<00:04:13.310> removing

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
pretty good so we're not really removing

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.960 
pretty good so we're not really removing
any<00:04:13.940> metal<00:04:14.360> there's<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.200> few<00:04:15.410> Birds<00:04:15.680> down<00:04:15.920> here

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.920 

where<00:04:19.970> it's<00:04:20.180> worn<00:04:21.280> right<00:04:22.280> here<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> little

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
where it's worn right here like a little

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.800 
where it's worn right here like a little
edge<00:04:24.170> see<00:04:24.980> that<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:26.030> doesn't<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:26.510> bother

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
edge see that it doesn't really bother

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.140 
edge see that it doesn't really bother
it<00:04:27.170> when<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.440> looked<00:04:27.710> at<00:04:27.890> it<00:04:27.950> but<00:04:28.250> we<00:04:28.730> still<00:04:29.030> may

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
it when I looked at it but we still may

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.610 
it when I looked at it but we still may
file<00:04:29.450> at<00:04:29.630> all<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:32.360> there<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> go<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.440> put

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
file at all but there you go and you put

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.110 
file at all but there you go and you put
this<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:34.010> here<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.250> will<00:04:34.520> float<00:04:34.790> on<00:04:34.820> there

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
this on here that will float on there

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.480 
this on here that will float on there
now<00:04:35.290> we're<00:04:36.290> going<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.710> use<00:04:36.830> this<00:04:37.130> grease<00:04:37.460> that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
now we're going to use this grease that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.210 
now we're going to use this grease that
has<00:04:39.940> with<00:04:40.940> multigraph<00:04:41.390> light<00:04:41.890> Dan<00:04:42.890> one<00:04:43.040> will

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
has with multigraph light Dan one will

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.800 
has with multigraph light Dan one will
switch<00:04:43.430> over<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.670> right<00:04:43.850> degrees<00:04:44.210> because

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
switch over to right degrees because

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.130 
switch over to right degrees because
that<00:04:45.650> will<00:04:45.860> help<00:04:46.040> everything<00:04:46.640> kind<00:04:46.910> of<00:04:46.970> wear

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.080 

cuz<00:04:51.140> it's<00:04:51.320> for<00:04:51.470> engine<00:04:51.770> bearings<00:04:51.980> so<00:04:52.880> that's

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
cuz it's for engine bearings so that's

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.460 
cuz it's for engine bearings so that's
the<00:04:53.240> grease<00:04:53.419> we're<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.720> use<00:04:53.870> on<00:04:54.050> this<00:04:54.230> stuff

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
the grease we're to use on this stuff

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.170 
the grease we're to use on this stuff
first<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:55.100> may<00:04:55.250> just<00:04:55.460> keep<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.850> in<00:04:55.910> there<00:04:56.000> but

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
first you may just keep it in there but

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.600 
first you may just keep it in there but
I<00:04:56.450> don't<00:04:56.690> have<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.740> possibility<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.400> making

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
I don't have the possibility of making

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.670 
I don't have the possibility of making
some<00:04:59.030> extra<00:04:59.240> wherever<00:04:59.900> it'd<00:05:00.380> be<00:05:00.530> like

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
some extra wherever it'd be like

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.460 
some extra wherever it'd be like
laughing<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.520> there<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.900> could<00:05:03.080> use<00:05:03.230> even

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
laughing and in there you could use even

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.200 
laughing and in there you could use even
that<00:05:03.740> compound<00:05:04.280> for<00:05:04.460> granting<00:05:04.730> your<00:05:04.790> vowels

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
that compound for granting your vowels

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.270 
that compound for granting your vowels
and<00:05:05.330> small<00:05:05.570> engines<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.950> could<00:05:07.070> put<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
and small engines and you could put that
