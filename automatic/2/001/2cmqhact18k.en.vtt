some kind of awesome yeah I like that

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.979 
some kind of awesome yeah I like that
intro<00:00:31.029> that's<00:00:31.210> pretty<00:00:31.390> good<00:00:31.509> you<00:00:31.719> said<00:00:31.899> we

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
intro that's pretty good you said we

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.190 
intro that's pretty good you said we
should<00:00:32.169> stick<00:00:32.320> with<00:00:32.349> that<00:00:32.559> one<00:00:32.710> alright<00:00:33.629> so<00:00:34.629> in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
should stick with that one alright so in

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.450 
should stick with that one alright so in
front<00:00:35.440> of<00:00:35.500> me<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.590> think<00:00:35.680> you<00:00:35.890> guys<00:00:35.980> have<00:00:36.280> the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
front of me I think you guys have the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.030 
front of me I think you guys have the
the<00:00:36.700> new<00:00:36.850> 9<00:00:37.090> 64<00:00:37.540> gigabyte<00:00:38.230> version<00:00:38.260> right<00:00:38.830> is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
the new 9 64 gigabyte version right is

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.500 
the new 9 64 gigabyte version right is
that<00:00:39.130> what<00:00:39.250> we're<00:00:39.340> looking<00:00:39.550> at<00:00:39.640> yeah<00:00:39.940> so<00:00:40.210> with

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
that what we're looking at yeah so with

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.820 
that what we're looking at yeah so with
the<00:00:40.600> larger<00:00:40.930> frame<00:00:41.200> buffer<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.530> just<00:00:41.650> have<00:00:41.740> to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
the larger frame buffer I just have to

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.890 
the larger frame buffer I just have to
ask<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.160> what<00:00:42.610> are<00:00:42.700> what<00:00:42.850> are<00:00:42.880> gonna<00:00:43.060> be<00:00:43.630> some

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
ask you what are what are gonna be some

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.900 
ask you what are what are gonna be some
of<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.079> benefits<00:00:44.230> cuz<00:00:44.590> I<00:00:44.650> can<00:00:44.829> I<00:00:45.070> could<00:00:45.670> guess

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
of the benefits cuz I can I could guess

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.490 
of the benefits cuz I can I could guess
what<00:00:46.090> they<00:00:46.210> are<00:00:46.329> but<00:00:46.780> I've<00:00:46.930> been<00:00:47.050> told<00:00:47.260> some

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
what they are but I've been told some

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.750 
what they are but I've been told some
conflicting<00:00:47.800> things<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.430> just<00:00:48.579> want<00:00:48.700> to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
conflicting things and I just want to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.220 
conflicting things and I just want to
get<00:00:48.820> from<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.000> what's<00:00:49.240> the<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.690> primary

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
get from you what's the the primary

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.720 
get from you what's the the primary
reason<00:00:50.560> you<00:00:50.650> want<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.890> go<00:00:51.010> with<00:00:51.130> that<00:00:51.250> yeah<00:00:51.550> so

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
reason you want to go with that yeah so

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.130 
reason you want to go with that yeah so
the<00:00:51.820> biggest<00:00:52.000> benefit<00:00:52.420> would<00:00:52.540> be<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.900> some

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
the biggest benefit would be in some

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.900 
the biggest benefit would be in some
game<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.710> could<00:00:53.920> select<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.370> higher<00:00:54.520> texture

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
game you could select a higher texture

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.569 
game you could select a higher texture
resolution<00:00:55.000> for<00:00:55.570> example<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:57.160> more<00:00:57.340> memory

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
resolution for example the more memory

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.639 
resolution for example the more memory
the<00:00:58.000> more<00:00:58.180> memory<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:58.930> on<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> car<00:00:59.470> the

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
the more memory you have on the car the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.930 
the more memory you have on the car the
higher<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.010> texture<00:01:00.280> resolution<00:01:00.399> can<00:01:00.910> be

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
higher the texture resolution can be

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.370 
higher the texture resolution can be
supported<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.480> game<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:02.230> biggest

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
supported in the game the biggest

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.720 
supported in the game the biggest
benefit<00:01:02.770> that<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.950> see<00:01:03.130> is<00:01:03.250> especially<00:01:03.640> with

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
benefit that I see is especially with

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.429 
benefit that I see is especially with
SLI<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.360> have<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.509> lot<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.689> GPU<00:01:05.079> horsepower

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
SLI you have a lot of GPU horsepower

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.620 
SLI you have a lot of GPU horsepower
when<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.680> pair<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:05.979> two<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.250> these<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
when you pair up two of these and and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.419 
when you pair up two of these and and
the<00:01:07.930> extra<00:01:08.470> frame<00:01:08.680> buffer<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:09.040> really<00:01:09.280> help

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
the extra frame buffer can really help

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.879 
the extra frame buffer can really help
in<00:01:09.759> at<00:01:10.270> higher<00:01:10.479> resolutions<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.530> games

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:11.889 
in at higher resolutions and and games

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:13.800 
in at higher resolutions and and games
that<00:01:12.039> use<00:01:12.189> higher<00:01:12.460> texture<00:01:12.789> resolutions<00:01:13.329> okay

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
that use higher texture resolutions okay

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.840 
that use higher texture resolutions okay
so<00:01:14.200> for<00:01:14.560> instance<00:01:14.619> my<00:01:14.950> words<00:01:15.130> gonna<00:01:15.249> maybe<00:01:15.609> run

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
so for instance my words gonna maybe run

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.330 
so for instance my words gonna maybe run
like<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.090> Skyrim<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.109> mod<00:01:17.469> with<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.859> or<00:01:18.189> if<00:01:18.280> I

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
like a Skyrim and mod with that or if I

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.309 
like a Skyrim and mod with that or if I
was<00:01:18.460> going<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:18.609> run<00:01:18.759> maybe<00:01:19.030> gta4<00:01:19.569> run<00:01:19.840> mods

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
was going to run maybe gta4 run mods

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.929 
was going to run maybe gta4 run mods
with<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.709> obviously<00:01:21.280> I'm<00:01:21.429> going<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.609> take<00:01:21.789> up

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
with that obviously I'm going to take up

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.669 
with that obviously I'm going to take up
more<00:01:22.119> vram<00:01:22.479> at<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.749> point<00:01:23.020> right<00:01:23.289> you<00:01:23.619> know

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
more vram at that point right you know

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.770 
more vram at that point right you know
that's<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.429> advantage<00:01:24.549> but<00:01:24.969> then<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.389> single

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
that's one advantage but then a single

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.209 
that's one advantage but then a single
card<00:01:26.109> maybe<00:01:26.259> not<00:01:26.439> taking<00:01:26.740> as<00:01:26.829> much<00:01:26.920> advantage

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
card maybe not taking as much advantage

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.550 
card maybe not taking as much advantage
of<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.490> four<00:01:27.670> gig<00:01:27.819> as<00:01:27.939> maybe<00:01:28.209> you<00:01:29.109> know<00:01:29.229> in

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
of the four gig as maybe you know in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.340 
of the four gig as maybe you know in
some<00:01:29.829> cases<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.520> may<00:01:30.719> prove<00:01:31.719> a<00:01:31.869> benefit<00:01:32.229> with

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
some cases it may prove a benefit with

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.349 
some cases it may prove a benefit with
four<00:01:32.499> gigabytes<00:01:32.859> but<00:01:33.100> primarily<00:01:33.579> SLI<00:01:34.179> where

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
four gigabytes but primarily SLI where

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.179 
four gigabytes but primarily SLI where
you<00:01:34.450> have<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.659> lot<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.049> GPU<00:01:35.499> horsepower<00:01:35.889> and

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
you have a lot of GPU horsepower and

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.709 
you have a lot of GPU horsepower and
then<00:01:36.310> extra<00:01:36.549> memory<00:01:36.700> really<00:01:37.029> helps<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.359> take

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
then extra memory really helps to take

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.969 
then extra memory really helps to take
it<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.929> kind<00:01:38.139> of<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.259> next<00:01:38.439> level<00:01:38.679> there<00:01:38.829> with

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
it to kind of the next level there with

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.230 
it to kind of the next level there with
the<00:01:39.069> higher<00:01:39.189> texture<00:01:39.520> resolutions<00:01:40.060> and

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240
