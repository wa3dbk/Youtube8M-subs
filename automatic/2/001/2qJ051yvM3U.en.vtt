 usefulness 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.310
 you put that and after you run mw3 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.180
 or in w of everyday you want 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.390
 what after comfort level the as350 there a 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.500
 very thick foam and here we will say 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.210
 go 10 mm of covers after he has the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.280
 cover inside the headphones so 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.060
 he is really very comfortable very 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.760
 very comfortable 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.900
 it is us just up here to there 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.240
 not that it hurts too much 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.410
 head 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.330
 after the helmet it is plastic but 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.619
 not plastic shit what's not it 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 for 300 euros he did not put any 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.410
 crappy plastic fortunately it is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.230
 everything while plastic 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.780
 apart from that place you could 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.160
 see this place that is scrap 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.180
 after here you do it's to settle 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.709
 the volume of the game 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.300
 if you want to put stronger less 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.270
 loudly so here wait i'll I'm going 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.180
 activate the flash you may see 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.880
 better so here's the on the button on 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.930
 see one two three there the button that I 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.820
 see you do not see very well but hey 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.910
 I will explain a little bit to you then his 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.710
 number one actually is to read the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.360
 videos on youtube 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.830
 all the videos like this youtube 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 dailymotion videos of your holidays 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.870
 all what 2 is for games 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.410
 and movies and 3c for games but 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.900
 experienced so I put in 3 because 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 that I'm a w3 so we hear 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.920
 a lot of people's backgrounds what the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.520
 in fact it's quite serious what the 2 c on 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.960
 will say acute and severe and the acute 3c and 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.010
 his patrols no more huh I say that 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.430
 like that after the microphone so here I you 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.300
 presented a little micro so micro of 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.970
 here 3,50 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.790
 we can talk to people and there is 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.470
 a small notch s it feel when 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.810
 puts up that means the bei and 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.220
 in dumb actually we speak but they we 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.940
 do not hear after level basement level 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.350
 base of the as350 good I am a 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.580
 little disappointed by the basement because 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.410
 for 300 euros I thought they 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.640
 would put another bag 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 plastic it's all had been at all 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.350
 plastic what so I was expecting 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.420
 better than that there you see a button 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.090
 to turn it on and here there is a button 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.940
 with a gentleman is a helmet when 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.050
 you actually press they do not broadcast 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.860
 5 points when you are year 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.600
 turn it off it broadcasts 7 points but 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.120
 good on the xbox learns that five points 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.440
 so the corner set is not very useful 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.860
 here as you can see left and 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.680
 auxc to connect for example the mp4 a 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.590
 phone everything you want everything to 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.640
 right here this is to reload the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.300
 astronomy this to recharge here there is 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.320
 marked pwr pwr actually it's for the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.790
 connect to the console 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.040
 if you plug in here you plug it in 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.580
 directly behind the console there is 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.900
 marked opt pulled enc in fact the cable 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.380
 optical that you also plug in to 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.190
 console for that outgoing 7 points 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.600
 so there I pretty much all 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.210
 presented I have you pretty much 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.949
 me but 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.770
 the only flaw I find is that no 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.750
 they did not try to arrange by 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.840
 compared to at 40 I was expecting 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.250
 aesthetically better level are I you 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.900
 say right now I have not here yet 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.880
 I did not try to 40 so I can not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.979
 tell you if it's better than the 40 or 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.660
 not me I know that at 50 it is 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.199
 really very well there is a magnificent 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.990
 we can hear people on the w3c 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.610
 that's wonderful 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.430
 so I wanted it is appreciated a little 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.169
 this video is here I broadcast you a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.060
 little video of me looking for and 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.740
 destruction either to raise us 3 for 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.910
 you see how you enter hears 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.229
 with the race 3,50 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.229
 so here is thanks to all 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.110
 goodbye cp gerare so I did the 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.160
 little text act the 3 1 when I go 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.690
 show you how people are heard 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.280
 on a 3g w and report therefore advocates 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.600
 against here I am going to camp a small 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.190
 place to show you because if 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.540
 I rock 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.050
 it's nothing you have not completed 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.840
 to hear them just before then so I'm 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.240
 put it here and I want to hear them 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.650
 there I hear a tariff of the right ad 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.970
 I'm watching I'm watching he's hoping 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.630
 you see how we hear very very 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.550
 far away the agent only reaches that wrinkle 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.930
 right 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.460
 so I replace myself I recharge and 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.510
 the other they arrive to my left I 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.320
 hear him up left and there another 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.460
 square goes right 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:17.470
 he arrives and here he is there then for 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.630
 configure the ace 350 when you receive 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.970
 you just press this button there you 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.500
 had you press it three seconds 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.630
 three seconds press you here is it 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.130
 flashes white you see hop there the 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.020
 helmet you do the same you turn it on 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.160
 a red initially support you once 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.470
 it's in red you see the little 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.470
 button or there and you press three 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.210
 seconds and here it is a little 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.490
 white dot also they are in the process of 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.540
 synchronize it in white directly 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.010
 pupils to become red 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.440
 and here it becomes red vodka 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.350
 synchronized with the 1005 so that 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.060
 everything is ok so here it was my little 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.500
