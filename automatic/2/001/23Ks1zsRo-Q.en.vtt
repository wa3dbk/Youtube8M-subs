 to delete your text message as 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 I said just enter here the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.200
 text message 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.700
 here are several options one option is 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.830
 suddenly entering here the message of 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.870
 text in this case 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.210
 it 's just a text message if 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.400
 we would like to eliminate all messages 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 of text that have arrived here we give here 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 the three little dots and saying by 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.040
 chain the biggest chain will erase 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.290
 immediately 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 erased would erase all this 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.670
 simulate several message strings without 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 But he left the last one in this case what 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 what we do is to leave the button 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.470
 sunk on this and we give it here of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.560
 choose conversation we took them 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 we give this challenge garbage and drowsiness 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.659
 immediately the euro because the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.659
 savings because that contact I have it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.640
 blocked the following way we're going to 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.189
 enter here here what I did was 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 block it with a candadito we are going to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.899
 select the button where to block 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.570
 that was already unlocked is not what 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.280
 I do is erase string delete and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.490
 effectively already assured 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.799
 and indirectly choose them as 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.190
 unlock a chain that was 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.700
 blocked and that prevented it from being erased 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.170
 that message if we want to erase now 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.270
 that other message we're going here the button 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.040
 sunk in this case I think this 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.130
 You also have the option of blocked 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.709
 here is blocked we leave a video of 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.030
 we are blocking caritas and you can 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.410
 give the button gave and elaborate here not if 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 we had a whole big list of 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.060
 incoming messages from different 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.280
 amac contacts and the three dots and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.130
 the improve all conversations and 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.660
