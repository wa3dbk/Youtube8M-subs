00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
interesting thing about this park is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.840 
interesting thing about this park is
that<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.490> here

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
that there's more not here than is here

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.050 
that there's more not here than is here
uh<00:01:17.880> looks<00:01:18.799> completely<00:01:19.799> abandoned<00:01:20.460> looks<00:01:20.939> like

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
uh looks completely abandoned looks like

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
uh looks completely abandoned looks like
someone<00:01:21.330> came<00:01:21.479> through<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.020> grabbed<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.890> bunch

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
someone came through and grabbed a bunch

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
someone came through and grabbed a bunch
of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> stuff<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:23.939> made<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of the stuff and just made off with it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
of the stuff and just made off with it
you<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> looks<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:25.950> maybe<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you see it looks like maybe some kind of

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
you see it looks like maybe some kind of
old<00:01:28.080> flat<00:01:29.070> ride<00:01:29.280> back<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.030> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
old flat ride back there where it's just

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940

literally<00:01:30.420> sitting<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> wooden<00:01:31.799> block

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
literally sitting on a wooden block

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
literally sitting on a wooden block
there<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.119> blocked<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:34.439> sure

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
be really interesting to kind of compare

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
be really interesting to kind of compare
before<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> after<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:37.950> time<00:01:38.430> gives<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> park
