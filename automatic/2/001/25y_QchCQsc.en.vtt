00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.890
 Russian astronomers 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 looks very welding on the ground 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 it seems that we see the same 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.269
 terrain features on the moon 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269
 surface 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.710
 because the moon revolves around its 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.500
 axes in the same time span which 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.220
 it rotates around the earth about four 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.950
 weeks 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.880
 therefore, we are always addressed to one and that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.220
 the same side of the ulans is what we see as 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.930
 change or phase of the moon actually 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.410
 change in the light of the moon 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.200
 sometime poverty will replace this moon 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 the cycle begins with a new moon when the moon 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.820
 is in the same direction from us 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 that and the sun is this side of the moon which 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.680
 facing the ground dark and completely 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 are lost by sunshine during 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.390
 the first quarter the moon passes one 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 fourth of its orbit in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.229
 this point, it is under direct 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.109
 angle to the sun but apparently I'm half 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.299
 lit a week later when the moon 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.609
 full she is on the opposite 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.399
 aside side of the sky and goes back like 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.600
 just the sun goes down the whole disk of the moon 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.539
 fully lit 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 the moon reaches 3 quarters yet through 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.899
 a week 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.670
 the land seems to be reduced to 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.170
 hearts to start your cycle again 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.749
 since the moon is so far away that she is always 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 It seems the same for everyone who can 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.539
 see and from the ground 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.719
 she may be in different places 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.420
 sky depending on where in 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.539
 you are but the appearance is always 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.149
 same one wonder what if you 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.100
 are in the southern hemisphere of the earth the moon 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.929
 you will see upside down on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 compared to the northern hemisphere 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.569
 and even if the moon were changing 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.420
 all the time it would be just an effect 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.189
 podcast coverage 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.200
 Russia is my country foolishness from Goa from 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.200
 solar center infrared rest
