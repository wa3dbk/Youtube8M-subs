 must be identified and then destroyed 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.359
 the enemy 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.989
 thanks to radars and bombs named 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.789
 vegetables 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.869
 there are eight different types of 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.100
 bombs with time bombs 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.350
 incendiary chemical bombs and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.520
 even good defensive here a good 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.910
 defense is actually mostly balance 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 shield women out brief return counter 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.679
 the carpet is ranked number 10 6 in the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.660
 world top is a young asocial 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.099
 insolent and mean he has no 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.720
 social relation apart in the game a 

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.910
 day without knowing why men 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.800
 remove it ryota then wakes up on 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.739
 a tropical island with a big pain of 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.170
 skull and memories that mix 

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.160
 that's when a madman starts to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.989
 the attack with bombs 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.429
 then follow a chase 

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:39.020
 come succeed you then to get rid 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.729
 of his pursuer and realizes 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.209
 that they find themselves immersed in everything 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.759
 but in real life then follows 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.590
 a royal battle where to survive he 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.170
 will have to find and kill others 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.090
 competitors the delirium of the game survival 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.759
 is not necessarily original but it 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.440
 remain captivating indulge in animating who 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.060
 is quite violent we see by 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.080
 movements of decapitated bodies cent 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.030
 think so but we have to do 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.470
 be careful because it's not free 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.239
 it's not gratuitous violence 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.979
 it's not night tiagra opca and the 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.720
 violence and decapitated and fucking bodies 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.489
 it's super college nonnon is also a 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.770
 mature share in the psychology of 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.300
 different characters 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.770
 I worked well many 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.510
 questions will then arise in ryota 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.930
 have to kill real humans for 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.370
 escape 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.570
 can I be betrayed 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.070
 if I associate myself with others 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.120
 participants the question also of 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.770
 awareness of others 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.930
 participants and well treated each 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.850
 boom character has his own way 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.590
 to think but his own personality 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 good to him there will be madness 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.620
 gratuitous violence of the cowardice of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.990
 bloodthirsty beasts 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 can our minds the team and you 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.100
 will see how teams form 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.260
 how these different personalities 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.820
 will cohabit where will be destroyed then 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.920
 why everything is a leap to nimes 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.780
 the animation of the studio is very very very 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.550
 beautiful we are entitled to action scenes 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.200
 very stressful extremely disappointing 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.300
 Finally they are explosive without 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.800
 word game musicians we are entitled to 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.260
 very beautiful scenery they are colored 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.370
 we go from the beach to the plateau 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.350
 rocky in abandoned buildings 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.180
 so the choice is between two or three 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.550
 explosions and fusions of meaning 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.110
 there will be a psychological battle 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.820
 but also important themes 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.440
 which will be reflected for example 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.880
 of hope where the trust they were 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.070
 in play mix between good achievement 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.330
 screenwriting scenarios situation made 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.500
 that we're bored never let's go 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.090
 now at the negative point is 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.260
 actually because there is everything 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.990
 first the two main characters 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.970
 ryota is a hero ultra clichÃ©s a 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.770
 progression way from the little asshole to 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.350
 generous and brave guy and the 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.630
 poverty nico that remains in the background 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.580
 who can be at cables have everything and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.260
 anything that looks like 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:42.810
 strong truce woman in videos one is 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.620
 in the presence of a new sakura finally 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.540
 then there is also the story that is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.010
 not very original because of the gender theme 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.350
 has evolved everything but is akin to 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.090
 royal battle or even mirai nikki and 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.490
 in the night the video game issue 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.320
 is not treated enough do not understand 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.750
 really why the characters are 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.890
 there and what is the purpose of those who 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.330
 pull the strings in the shade 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.180
 all because the night is very short 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.860
 twelve episodes only and because the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.600
 manga chapters that come out at 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.610
 account drops the manga as a whole 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.080
 is good even though the drawing of some 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.790
 characters remain disturbing when 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.190
 started at all in anime but 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.080
 all of all and very good 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.640
 offers a good scenario a good 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.440
 history even though we feel the inspiration 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.880
 of interest as I tell him everything we 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.169
 offer different characters more 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.090
 interesting each other with 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.620
 a very good 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.780
 graphic is not the major work of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.820
 this last decade but she deserves 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.350
 returns to the interest that leaves you the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.540
 time to catch up because she animates 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.600
 over a moment in the oils 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.220
 of fuckers this game I said at the end of 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.570
 the year while say shit but 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.320
 why they ended up being left 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:48.300
 really and why lightens why 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.440
 and after the end of a doubt really 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.540
 want to know more 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.370
 so I wish you to follow everything 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.300
 moment if you are stopped late 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.410
 year 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.700
 my mission is now complete 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.680
 I hope this presentation you 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.550
 will make you want to watch all or even 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.720
 say request like I would like you 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.000
 give it back because now we are 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.520

 why not let's be crazy be crazy huh 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.180
 the style is simple comment for me

 whether I improved quality which 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.350
 has not been and I still have things to 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.120
