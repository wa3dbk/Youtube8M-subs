00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.589
 the scale 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.290
 important because the weight of the pilot will be fundamental 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.740
 giorgio piola explains this year why 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.390
 yes because with the third of which takes away beyond 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.990
 30 say it is important that the pilot gets to the minimum of his possible weight for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.109
 be able to mount more ballast because then total weight must always be 605 tv 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.449
 the right tension for this felipe massa debut 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.929
 that it was the machines we said reds medley fundamental in that season 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.940
 difficult to pass na caressed this f60 the new steering wheel difficult 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.719
 because being played all the way down here we see the new the ante should be 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.729
 positioned in the upper right corner second second 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.750
 of the pilot's comfort the vote of the cheers 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.050
 yes of course you have to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.470
 the foot, dollar 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.800
 Now 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 but we are 123 with the n 62 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.500
 when this picture 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.700
 fun room and women 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.790
 good food camera 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.360
 piperitapatty then as we do in commentary let me enjoy a little 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.360
 unipol volume bank and let's go with felipe massa 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.969
 but I call you Giane 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.969
 pennette all'arrabbiata recipe 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.110
 this mail 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.890
 facebook loaded 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 details regarding this 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.800
 another image of the film came 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.410
 libero.it found several real people completely video as it is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.900
 sees 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.729
 the side mirror that mounted on those 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.679
 brand new revolutionary rentals 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.159
 they have become real PCs because they don't 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.569
 return box interesting to see it because why 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.079
 and now you will see that the mechanics do not immediately approach the machine there 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.120
 machine falls for pc this lost icon the batteries there is the danger 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.800
 risk of the bride 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.180
 comes the pilot mechanical engineers immediately 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.790
 I put my hands on the machine but now they have to wait for the okay they have to 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.799
 be sure 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.579
 to be able to approach the car look and then the okay arrives 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.869
 where mechanics can get their hands on u 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.260
 I can tell you a funny thing but this 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.120
 I don't like it because it means that when the cars don't come the boxes 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.850
 there is more need to run fast for he managed to take pictures because i 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.900
 mechanics will be a little further away this is the technical aspect that concerns 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.179
 above all your work here is the end of this test 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.799
 first felipe massa talks with felipe massa
