00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.020 
increments and one of the reasons for
that<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> we've<00:01:53.189> identified<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:54.060> market<00:01:54.450> where

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
that is we've identified a market where

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
that is we've identified a market where
women<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.659> leg<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:57.869> shorter<00:01:58.079> than

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
women have one leg that's shorter than

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.000 
women have one leg that's shorter than
the<00:01:58.530> other<00:01:58.649> and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
the other and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.910 
the other and
one<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.340> their<00:02:00.460> legs<00:02:01.410> you'll<00:02:02.410> be<00:02:02.560> able<00:02:02.620> to<00:02:02.770> put

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
one of their legs you'll be able to put

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.650 
one of their legs you'll be able to put
on<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.040> higher<00:02:03.370> heel<00:02:03.700> height<00:02:03.910> on<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.240> left<00:02:04.450> leg

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
on a higher heel height on the left leg

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.140 
on a higher heel height on the left leg
rather<00:02:04.960> than<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.320> right<00:02:05.470> leg<00:02:05.650> in<00:02:06.010> that<00:02:06.250> way<00:02:06.430> so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
rather than the right leg in that way so

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.590 
rather than the right leg in that way so
there's<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.450> medical<00:02:07.960> benefit<00:02:08.320> right<00:02:09.600> Kandace

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
there's a medical benefit right Kandace

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.540 
there's a medical benefit right Kandace

when did you come up with this idea I

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.530 
when did you come up with this idea I
came<00:02:14.710> up<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.430> probably<00:02:15.730> about<00:02:16.330> five

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
came up with it probably about five

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.970 
came up with it probably about five
years<00:02:16.750> ago<00:02:16.900> I'm<00:02:17.170> sure<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:17.590> night<00:02:17.770> when<00:02:17.950> my

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
years ago I'm sure one night when my

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.770 
years ago I'm sure one night when my
feet<00:02:18.280> are<00:02:18.310> really<00:02:18.460> hurting<00:02:19.030> me<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.570> was

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
feet are really hurting me and I was

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.690 
feet are really hurting me and I was
just<00:02:20.020> looking<00:02:20.200> at<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> pair<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.830> stiletto<00:02:21.310> shoes

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
just looking at a pair of stiletto shoes
and<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.150> thought<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:23.050> know<00:02:23.200> looking<00:02:24.040> at<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
and I thought you know looking at that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
and I thought you know looking at that
thin<00:02:24.610> heel<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.060> looks<00:02:25.210> like<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.480> could<00:02:25.600> easily

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
thin heel it looks like you could easily

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.720 
thin heel it looks like you could easily
put<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.320> screw<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:26.890> something<00:02:27.070> like<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.520> so

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
put in a screw or something like that so

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.710 
put in a screw or something like that so
why<00:02:27.880> can't<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> shoe<00:02:29.940> heel<00:02:30.940> after

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
why can't we just make a shoe heel after

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.470 
why can't we just make a shoe heel after
