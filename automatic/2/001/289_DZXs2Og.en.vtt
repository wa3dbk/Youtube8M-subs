00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.559
 gorgeous and unsurpassed beauties 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.710
 meet goals 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.710
 Irina Milano and Christina Bykov 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.040
 they say that a girl should give such 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.470
 dress to mentally want 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.330
 strip with her eyes what kind of feeling 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.460
 emerged from our jury members at the sight 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.070
 of our charming girls, let us 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.930
 they do not lunge them girls I you all 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.170
 valyl throughout the program 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.369
 but now my emotions are better not 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.100
 speak out 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.560
 Here in these two options sends me 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.600
 naturally for weddings that option 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.630
 sends me to the yacht in Saint-trope 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.030
 I want to stay in Kiev on our show and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.310
 I 'll probably see the style icon 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.649
 Christine with you and your dress to me 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.979
 she liked it is difficult is she cut 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.220
 incomprehensible is for some kind of wedding 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.899
 celebration special was still seized 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.490
 practically th be it so I do not want 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:15.430
 it's just too early to say 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:17.530
 oh he doesn't know yet 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.380
 delighted with the dress I find it interesting 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.239
 on you she looks cute and here 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.140
 this is a clutch decoration such a min order 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.140
 you chose 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.870
 but I know you I watched and thought but 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 that's how it is but why I needed 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.950
 wear this shoe 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.340
 I think that danil maybe not to style 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.340
 do you have any claims from your mustard 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.530
 one dose if it was only but i dont 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.900
 know or drastically different color but 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.709
 mustard shade it does not match any 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.109
 skin color 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.060
 with nothing and does not fit in white 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.430
 dress here I would like you girls 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.829
 show your shoes and together now 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.880
 synchronously and here now look at 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.549
 colorist if you were backstage so 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.310
 Changed then and 1 and 2 would have earned on 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.590
 two points more why because under 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.720
 your color would be perfect 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.180
 shoes and a white dress perfect 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.870
 come on I can change my shoes 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.989
 such a pair 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.530
 no you had one way out to him you 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.430
 getting ready and you with spending I do not understand 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.859
 what do you want 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.140
 poor girls so everything is fresh so everything 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.829
 feminine no such outspoken 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.650
 accessibility is just so innocent 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.790

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.849

 how to say my two members are exactly 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.340
 They said that this wedding dress is already 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.400
 you canâ€™t get anywhere with you 3 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.560
 but I can tell you that several 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.079
 events that I attended here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.269
 literally just recently you 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.030
 imagine that there were girls in white 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.739
 similar dresses and nothing by the way Sergey 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.739
 would have seen her very close 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.939
 like the feathers befriended by this power 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:18.820

 Well, turning the yak did not just come 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.789

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.780

 you have a very good end 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.789
 This is Sergei Zverev Thank you very much I remember 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.800
 not our distinguished jury 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.770
 after such a beautiful evening 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.810
 exit should go throwing a bouquet and 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.039
 cutting a wedding cake girl 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.409
 thanks a lot 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.900
 but now our most crucial moment 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.360
 project you will have to say who 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.060
 becoming an icon of style and unfortunately we 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.060
 lose more of your beautiful girls 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.199
 colleagues honestly tell you if the previous 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.900
 hat though we wanted to leave 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.460
 leave three right away then here I am not 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.050
 I can say that all the girls managed 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.599
 with this task as for me here 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.029
 there is some clear leader and a favorite among 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.279
 I just do not have a favorite I would with 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.439
 gladly sent all three but 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.750
 excuse me for the last exit 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.629
 but when you already know this task 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.639
 wedding dress and evening dress this 2 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.219
 completely different categories when we have 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.169
 there will be an exit in wedding dresses then we 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:53.759
 will discuss with water but agreement 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.900
 something is paid to call wedding 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.900
 can be so with a stretch 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.279
 the most crucial moment of ours comes 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.779
 show 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.389
 the appetizing fat was very supportive 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.099
 to the girls and all three showed their 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.310
 best evening gowns 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.409
 but which of them managed to use the second 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.689
 chance 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:19.679
 who is worthy to fly to paris 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.409
 who can become an icon of style and who is 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:24.110
 glamor affairs 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:27.060
 Now we find out the name of the most stylish and 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.910
 fashion girl of our country 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.730
 and all the rest will fly by 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.730
 panera above paris from a height of three meters 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.850
 breathless we can name the name 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.510
 winners and so the 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.820
 unpredictable country fashion show 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.820
 style icon wins 

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:19.209
 very scary and it seems that well you fly 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.149
 like a short time but I have such a tunnel 

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:23.469
 it seems like I was flying but students of minutes 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:26.889
 Of course for myself they think that like me 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:29.860
 I said style icon because I have 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:32.860
 in your style particular style maybe he 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.869
 not completely understood was tried but honestly 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.929
 saying not a moment was upset and 

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:39.369
 change it there with some advice of course 

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:41.110
 listen for a change not drastically 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:44.110
 I'm going to think that I have everything 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.349
 Well , I had but not perfect 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:50.319
 images in principle that is, I had 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:51.459
 small mistakes small sinful life 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:54.789
 I will turn with them 

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:58.229
 to be a style icon for yourself and for 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:58.229
 close people around me
