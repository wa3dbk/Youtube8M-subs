00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.390
 I'm in Beijing at one hour from Belo 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.340
 horizon in the state of minas gerais and 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.490
 here is a nursery of something that is going 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.490
 surprise 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.050
 the juve act they breed five species 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 of edible insects because they believe that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 in 2050 there will be more than 9 million 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.410
 of inhabitants in this world and we do not 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.760
 we are going to supply and will not have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 enough ground to create 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 enough protein proteins like 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 cows pigs everything that started right now 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 and it's going to be very expensive then they 're 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 giving us this option to eat insects 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.580
 since they have discovered that they are very rich 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.780
 in proteins especially the cockroach 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.780
 crickets industries 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:02.160
 and the fly has more protein for 267 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.719
 and they're not cockroaches they have 60 by 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.979
 hundreds of proteins that prepare 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.979
 different gourmet dishes 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.820
 We are in the cockroach hatchery 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.360
 they are dark and very hot is the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360
 tropical environment 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.390
 and 4,600 carache of the world the 1% that 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.590
 it can cause a disease those who live 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.910
 in the cities that go to 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.280
 sewers that are among the 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.430
 women then the race of one and a half 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 and half 75 dollars that costs the kilo of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 cockroach in that they sell it 950 pesos the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950
 kilo of sugar at 150 kilos is produced from 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.440
 cockroaches a month here gourmet food 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.070
 edible because they want to educate 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.070
 The humanity 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.090
 in a drunken giant that is a kind of 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.420
 beetle or worm let's see 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.420
 the worm is the larva the first process 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.220
 if you make beetle that you eat in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.379
 beetle or the larva the long one is a 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.019
 worm of vodafone the larva is this 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.700
 communication not only the larva news 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.680
 slowly she is not going to eat alive 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.120
 they have to let it become beetle 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.519
 because the beetle is what the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 eggs so that the long three is created 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.390
 months in which the larva is made 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 be downstairs know your work starts to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.890
 put the eggs the months put you and 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.079
 they die and then how I live knows good with 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.079
 if I had to continue working 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.370
 saying funval 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.000
 which these medians are with 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.050
 extreme garbage rotten fruit 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.380
 organically they feed 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.320
 you do not eat the fly you do not eat the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.030
 fly alarm nothing else and the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.920
 next step the intermediate phase between 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.300
 the gun we say another 30 days and can 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.300

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.630

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:09.900
 you have to hydrate the flour and with that 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.930
 Flour biscuits etc are made 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.930
