you<00:01:55.120> have<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.330> do<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.810> um<00:01:56.020> save<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.830> frames

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you have to do is it um save the frames

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.250 
you have to do is it um save the frames
and<00:01:58.180> just<00:01:58.330> put<00:01:58.510> them<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.750> which<00:01:58.900> kind<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.140> makes

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
and just put them in which kind of makes

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.620 
and just put them in which kind of makes
it<00:01:59.410> harder<00:01:59.770> for<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.100> but<00:02:00.490> at<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.270> same<00:02:01.450> time

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it harder for you but at the same time

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.190 
it harder for you but at the same time
easier<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.130> I'm<00:02:03.850> going<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.330> just<00:02:04.420> cut<00:02:04.780> out<00:02:04.930> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
easier so I'm going to just cut out the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.740 
easier so I'm going to just cut out the
part<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.860> all<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:06.220> because<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:07.090> takes<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.420> long

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
part of all this because it takes a long

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.910 
part of all this because it takes a long
long<00:02:08.080> time<00:02:08.910> so
