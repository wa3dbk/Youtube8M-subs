00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.140
 fc energy tv is presented to you by 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.790
 once her partner for 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.790
 media productions and web solution 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.700
 Good day my ladies and gentlemen still 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.980
 from this point you are welcome to 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.599
 press conference following the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.160
 part of the third league between the fc 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.360
 Energie cottbus and the guests of red 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.279
 knows both trainers place 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.890
 you take even faster than some 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.450
 journalists is also rarely the cola 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.140
 please have the first word very much 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.710
 yes I think we have a lot today 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.899
 complete under game seen in the 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.460
 cottbus very very much pressure 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:49.460
 We had to do a lot of work for a long time 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.080
 invest a lot in the defensive and 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.010
 had thereby relatively little 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.210
 possibilities to move forward 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.910
 maybe sometimes a reason for that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.340
 is that with us immediately before kick-off 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.020
 Violence failed so we still had 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.430
 completely change over once too 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.500
 play another system 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.700
 you have that in the first one 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.060
 minutes but noticed my team 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.890
 has done very well and so on 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 after an hour or 70 minutes had 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.749
 I from the outside rather the feeling that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.619
 we and maybe one of us 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:25.880
 Counter from the rooms then us 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.560
 we were given that maybe there 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.539
 even able to score a goal 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.969
 we still have our options 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.170
 but they did not use them either 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.149
 used and therefore also think that it 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.649
 ultimately not undeserved 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.420
 for us that we took a point 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.310
 to have 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.610
 thank you walter kogler for sure 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.820
 word to stefan rammer yes from mine 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.770
 I'll also have a nice good day 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.020
 believe that we invested a lot 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.899
 have in the game that the relationship 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.200
 of expenditure and income not not quite 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.119
 fits with the 0 0 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.420
 think that until the 70th 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.070
 minutes to the 70 minute the clear 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.630
 many were the game-defining team 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 good opportunities had many 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.340
 had standard situations 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.170
 and yes, there are days there 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 miss you so business match luck that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.360
 the ball goes in with the guidance 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.000
 in the back and then with a little bit more 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.130
 admits monster even easier done 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.720
 then we get a counter in the 70th 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.430
 the one or the other a bit the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.739
 stolen conviction and I believe too 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.000
 that we have invested so much that 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.780
 We are so the last ten minutes 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.799
 in our staff situation can 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.290
 I might just have something to say 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.660
 then just not on it again 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.090
 There were games on the gas 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.590
 the same run or run 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.380
 like today that you still 0 1 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.570
 loses clearly could a second 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.859
 had the chance and that would be 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.609
 not the first game we have been 0 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.579
 1 or 01 then goes out because of that 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.260
 I have to live with the point afterwards 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.730
 What I can live very well is the one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.940
 performance of the team that occur 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.320
 a lot of things we do 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.250
 wanting to see him has his place 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.780
 brought and if we go on there 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.709
 then I think that's us too 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.459
 develop as we all do 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.140
 imagine 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.430
 Of course, there are five points after four 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.920
 Do not play the wisdom last 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.390
 We do not write either way 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 all ears are lying and cheering in the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.459
 Poor but the team is developing 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.170
 itself and that was a good step today 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.459
 Thank you very much 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.870
 thank you very much stefan rammer now exists 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.130
 As always the possibility to ask 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680
 ask for a short hand signal 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.950
 we have a microphone in the room who 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.950
 would like to 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.290
 they already indicated it 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.580
 maybe we can go to the staff 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.690
 situation maybe a bit 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.090
 to enter in more concrete terms 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.920
 yes so we have this tomorrow then the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.420
 get the message that michel and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.300
 Wood can not be used at least 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.780
 not over a longer period than 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.700
 20 minutes 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.400
 and that of course has the planning already 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 again as you can imagine 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.730
 jumbled up when you look 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.240
 sees in sum how many players were missing 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.060
 to have 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.350
 all the more remarkable I think the 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.740
 performance we still run space 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.740
 brought 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.570
 short demand Mr Kramer now 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.280
 twice cup once country cup once 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.660
 dfb cup will be two different 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.990
 Team given the importance 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.190
 for the team 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.630
 So I'll take care of it for now 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 Wednesday so we have someone today 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 sent the game looks at from 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 our next opponents we take 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.550
 as serious as any compulsory game 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.440
 and of course we will be the ones 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.090
 opportunity because we use the clear 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.320
 Favorit also claim to have 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.979
 to win the game and the next one 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.410
 to come round 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.849
 one or the other one 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.360
 give a break on average that's yes 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.210
 clearly 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.919
 but before I get to the hsv 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.310
 I take care of the times 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.310
 we want to win 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.449
 well I see no further ask the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.250
 redeem us all from the brutal heat 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.570
 Wish the guests good in here 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.840

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.160
