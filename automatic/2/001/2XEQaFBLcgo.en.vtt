00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
pretty good so some cupcakes and these

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.420 
pretty good so some cupcakes and these
are<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> coconut<00:01:04.320> flakes<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.890> toast<00:01:05.190> that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
are the coconut flakes that I toast that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.270 
are the coconut flakes that I toast that
these<00:01:05.550> are<00:01:05.700> sweetened<00:01:06.060> coconut<00:01:06.270> flakes<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
these are sweetened coconut flakes I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
these are sweetened coconut flakes I
place<00:01:08.280> them<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.610> oven<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.600> spread<00:01:09.900> them

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
place them in the oven and I spread them

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.609 
place them in the oven and I spread them
out<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.320> cookie<00:01:10.920> sheet<00:01:11.390> for<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.840> least<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
out on a cookie sheet for at least I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.660 
out on a cookie sheet for at least I
think<00:01:13.740> seven<00:01:14.430> minutes<00:01:14.850> total<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.860> at<00:01:16.860> 350

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
think seven minutes total and at 350

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
think seven minutes total and at 350
degrees<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> want<00:01:18.719> to<00:01:18.780> take<00:01:18.899> out<00:01:19.020> right

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
degrees and you want to take out right

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
degrees and you want to take out right
away<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> don't<00:01:19.619> burn<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> didn't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
away so you don't burn it so I didn't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
away so you don't burn it so I didn't
get<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.380> dark<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
get it this dark and it was more like a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
get it this dark and it was more like a
light<00:01:24.119> brown<00:01:24.390> color<00:01:24.649> after<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.680> toasted<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
light brown color after I toasted it so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
light brown color after I toasted it so
I<00:01:26.520> went<00:01:26.939> ahead<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.869> some<00:01:28.049> cocoa

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I went ahead and that's it some cocoa

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.550 
I went ahead and that's it some cocoa
powder<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.329> it's<00:01:30.329> cool<00:01:30.600> tastes<00:01:31.289> pretty<00:01:31.409> good

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
powder and it's cool tastes pretty good

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
powder and it's cool tastes pretty good
because<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.369> sweetened<00:01:32.640> coconut<00:01:32.729> flakes<00:01:33.149> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
because it's sweetened coconut flakes so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
because it's sweetened coconut flakes so
it<00:01:33.329> doesn't<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> bitter<00:01:34.170> chocolate<00:01:34.649> or

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it doesn't have the bitter chocolate or

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.510 
it doesn't have the bitter chocolate or
cocoa<00:01:35.039> to<00:01:35.340> taste<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:37.469> it's<00:01:37.649> darker<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
cocoa to taste so now it's darker and it

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.170 
cocoa to taste so now it's darker and it
looks<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:39.450> look<00:01:39.570> better<00:01:39.719> as<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.930> nest<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
looks will look better as a nest and

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.959 
looks will look better as a nest and
some<00:01:42.180> candy<00:01:42.689> whopper<00:01:43.079> eggs<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.789> are

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
some candy whopper eggs so these are

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.249 
some candy whopper eggs so these are
pretty<00:01:45.210> easy<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> find<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.810> any<00:01:45.930> grocery

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.450 
basic recipe I think it's four cups
powdered<00:02:00.119> sugar<00:02:00.630> 2<00:02:01.469> cups<00:02:01.859> softened<00:02:02.640> butter

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
powdered sugar 2 cups softened butter

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.670 
powdered sugar 2 cups softened butter
one<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.540> half<00:02:05.570> teaspoon<00:02:06.020> vanilla<00:02:06.140> or<00:02:06.500> two

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
one and a half teaspoon vanilla or two

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.480 
one and a half teaspoon vanilla or two
teaspoons<00:02:06.830> vanilla<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.660> two<00:02:08.660> tablespoons

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
teaspoons vanilla and two tablespoons

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.330 
teaspoons vanilla and two tablespoons
whole<00:02:10.490> milk<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.090> just<00:02:11.270> put<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.230> my<00:02:12.350> mixer

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
whole milk and I just put in my mixer

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.670 
whole milk and I just put in my mixer
and<00:02:13.580> beat<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.420> whipped<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.960> for<00:02:15.170> about<00:02:15.380> I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and beat it and whipped it for about I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.140 
and beat it and whipped it for about I
think<00:02:15.710> five<00:02:16.100> minutes<00:02:16.250> until<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.000> light<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
think five minutes until it's light and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
think five minutes until it's light and
fluffy<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:17.690> it's<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.200> pretty<00:02:18.380> basic<00:02:18.560> recipe<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
fluffy so it's a pretty basic recipe and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.890 
fluffy so it's a pretty basic recipe and
it's<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.430> lot<00:02:19.670> better<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.390> tastes<00:02:20.660> much<00:02:20.840> better

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
it's a lot better it tastes much better

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's a lot better it tastes much better
than<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> store-bought<00:02:21.880> frosting<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.900> we're

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
than the store-bought frosting so we're

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.410 
than the store-bought frosting so we're
going<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.440> foster's<00:02:25.010> cupcakes<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.670> then

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
going to foster's cupcakes and then

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.530 
going to foster's cupcakes and then
we'll<00:02:26.740> dip<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.890> into<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.460> coconut<00:02:29.120> flakes

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540

little<00:02:38.990> generous<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:40.070> way<00:02:40.250> your<00:02:40.850> coconut

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
little generous that way your coconut

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.890

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
flakes will stick onto it so you just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.410

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you can use some the piping method but

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.480 
you can use some the piping method but
this<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.420> easier<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.170> less<00:02:51.830> time<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:52.310> doesn't

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
this is easier and less time it doesn't

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.130
