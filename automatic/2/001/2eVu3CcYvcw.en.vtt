00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.109
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.390
 in this little tutorial indeed he is going to be 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.940
 short enough because we're going to bring out the 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.500
 displacement and I'm going to show you a 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.150
 little bit what I did for 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.340
 improve what we had previously 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.890
 and I will show you a little bit 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.470
 I integrated the mitis placement into the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.179
 heat that we created before 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.859
 it's not very complicated we already have it 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.909
 actually just replace a texture 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.939
 and add another display here 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.870
 over an insert almost then already 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.120
 in this time I'm going to show you the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.010
 parameters that I put in effect I had 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 a display which was quite weak in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.390
 did and just had to go up 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.820
 the intensity so to do that you have 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.240
 so in a plugin is managed export 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.850
 the map 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.740
 here in the ultimate coming supporter I have 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.750
 used that the display tweet I the 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.480
 exits in 4096 to have 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.430
 potentially more details and in 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.220
 the display options be here I am 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.340
 in adaptive are followed sgp in fact 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.189
 I removed the spx because that's me 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.590
 took a little time and I climbed 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.570
 here the scale to 23 the cottages 23 and 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.330
 intensity to something more 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.659
 high of 0.1 for example as this is the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.560
 case here 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.280
 to export mama and that gave me a tablecloth 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.250
 of this type 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.780
 I wanted to show in blender you 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.340
 see that when she is named she 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.590
 is out of this pocket she is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.880
 named with parentheses 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.350
 the intensity the 013 11 48 and so it's going 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.970
 give it as has a small 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.729
 manseng display which is much more 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.670
 much more precisely details 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.400
 he feels a character through this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.250
 option so suddenly its texture game the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.790
 Leader plugins in ours 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 so disappear character with a 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.170
 multiply between 2 to 0 5 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.049
 it allows single tube holds everything that is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.390
 say the fuel oil has stretched the game for 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.100
 accept a little bit there then discreet 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 on my match there is only one of a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 three- level surface at the rank of a 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.530
 attention it's important he has three 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.179
 rendering levels 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.100
 and there is only one in the east of the port 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.180
 can go up as yeah I think 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.480
 3 for example here and in fact I can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.310
 now a plus here it would be 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.020
 for the final rendering I had myself 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.600
 that tonight I will stay at 1 for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.890
 prevent it from paddling in the view door and 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.170
 we're looking for match place and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.010
 a texture and attention texture 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.760
 to billet and if in 10 countries texture 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:39.470
 gmi and my ma diffuse forgiveness my 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.570
 my displacement maps here I come back here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.790
 in my saas mode is there well the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.890
 texture at 10 bis maintainable here I 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.230
 well put the coordinates ans youri and 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.489
 I have a strength at 00 15 of intentions 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.560
 because in general it's pretty 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.030
 powerful displaysearch always opci if 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.340
 strict so you have to squeeze the force 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.480
 you have the direction that have 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.069
 operated normally ie 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.840
 each of the perpendicular to the polygon 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.750
 that's another one I had 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.560
 that this light game the thousand and one 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.430
 power of 5 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.840
 put in an average gray roughly 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.480
 and I kept only one letter on the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.370
 side that I put to six and with a small 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.160
 little way and I deleted a 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:36.320
 hotline who were there that bothered me 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.239
 wrong and that's it and that's pretty much 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.829
 the only things I changed is 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.799
 a sport almost to his thing wounds 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:46.579
 that I changed I made a rendering with 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:50.080
 2,800 centers in 100% to present this 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.110
 that gives and that's what it gives 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.730
 in the vehicle is off entry game 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.750
 the rendering its roundness results it gives 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.040
 that veiled it's pretty good 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.970
 despite some mistakes so we have some 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.620
 mistakes here on the sides that has to come 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.560
 fresnel I think after the ear 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.610
 it's pretty good 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 we had details coming out 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.510
 really good if we have a problem too 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.700
 which must always be linked to braking I 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.880
 think if we just have a problem that's the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.630
 texture in fact that is capable margin 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.990
 quite important 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 as we have succeeded follow us offs a 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.860
 one that corrects it in photoshop 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.150
 quite quickly and if I forgot 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.600
 last thing excuse me is that 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.730
 I lowered my eye size so for 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.340
 that they have lesions inside a 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.290
 not the harm granted until he is 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.180
 since slightly but really very 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.530
 slightly thinner and that's the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.120
 result when you get after rendering this 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.580
 tutorial as I told you he is 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.290
 very very short but it's for 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.610
 explain a little bit I did the 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.100
 manipulations to avoid going from 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.800
 time to go displaced but I have nothing 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.480
 else I know that's it now 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.000
 to resume the normal course of 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.169
 tutoring and advancing as much the tutorial 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.169
 next immediately
