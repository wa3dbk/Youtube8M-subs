putting<00:00:50.879> polymer<00:00:51.270> done<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> fertilizers<00:00:52.110> it's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
putting polymer done to fertilizers it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
putting polymer done to fertilizers it's
really<00:00:52.890> fascinating<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.539> put

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
really fascinating because when you put

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
really fascinating because when you put
the<00:00:54.899> material<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.190> roller<00:00:56.370> mixer<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the material in the roller mixer and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
the material in the roller mixer and
begin<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> apply<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> two-part<00:00:58.829> polymers

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
begin to apply the two-part polymers

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920 
begin to apply the two-part polymers
there's<00:00:59.699> actually<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> reaction<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> take

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
there's actually a reaction that take

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
there's actually a reaction that take
takes<00:01:01.440> place<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.699> fertilizer<00:01:03.120> actually

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
takes place and the fertilizer actually

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
takes place and the fertilizer actually
becomes<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.989> oatmeal<00:01:04.500> during<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
becomes like oatmeal during that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
becomes like oatmeal during that
transition<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:05.880> more<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> wet<00:01:06.540> cement<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
transition or more like a wet cement and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
transition or more like a wet cement and
then<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> polymers<00:01:08.490> cure<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.330> turns<00:01:09.630> back

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
then as the polymers cure it turns back

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
then as the polymers cure it turns back
into<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.320> real<00:01:10.619> nice<00:01:10.830> free-flowing<00:01:11.659> fertilizer

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
into a real nice free-flowing fertilizer

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.450 
into a real nice free-flowing fertilizer
but<00:01:13.290> they'll<00:01:13.500> turn<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.220> they'll<00:01:14.310> put

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
but they'll turn around and they'll put

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.640 
but they'll turn around and they'll put
in<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:14.790> cases<00:01:15.030> twelve<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.840> fourteen<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:16.320> even

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in some cases twelve or fourteen or even

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.670 
in some cases twelve or fourteen or even
up<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> sixteen<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:18.060> layers<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.869> these

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
up to sixteen different layers of these

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
up to sixteen different layers of these
different<00:01:20.100> polymer<00:01:20.490> coatings<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.030> are

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
different polymer coatings that are

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
different polymer coatings that are
microfilm<00:01:21.840> layers<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.130> affect<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
microfilm layers that have to affect the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
microfilm layers that have to affect the
amount<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> time<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.110> takes<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> release

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
amount of time that it takes to release

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
amount of time that it takes to release
so<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.210> role<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> mixer<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.869> very<00:01:28.049> versatile

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so the role of mixer is very versatile

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
so the role of mixer is very versatile
it<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.710> make<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> fine<00:01:29.369> cut<00:01:29.700> fertilizer

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it can make the fine cut fertilizer

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
it can make the fine cut fertilizer
materials<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> coarse<00:01:32.040> grain

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
materials as well as the coarse grain

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.010 
materials as well as the coarse grain
and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.090> whether<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.720> on

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and then whether you're going to put on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.310 
and then whether you're going to put on
four<00:01:34.829> percent<00:01:35.189> coating<00:01:35.610> or<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> 12<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.049> 16

percent coating the roller mixture works

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.710 
percent coating the roller mixture works
well<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.009> apply<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.970> polymer

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
