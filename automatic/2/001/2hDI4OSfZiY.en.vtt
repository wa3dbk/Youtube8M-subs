00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.399
 seven fifteen in the morning we are in 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.800
 the southern access to the pocket we observe how 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.700
 there was a large truck 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.010
 Chilean origin 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.710
 according to some witnesses tell us that no 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.110
 could stop at the moment they want to pass 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 that the donkey's back of the access to 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.619
 locality through this situation the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.829
 driver opted for as stated in the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.950
 jargon give a blow to the steering wheel 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.370
 in this situation 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.340
 is officially I'm not confirm that 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.680
 there would have been some cars parked 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.500
 or trying to pass the donkey down 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.750
 speed and this generated the driver 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.150
 of the truck had to perform these 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.360
 maneuvers so as not to impact 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.310
 we can observe in what position it was 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.160
 they tell us that he was already working 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.030
 police personnel in this sector where 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.340
 there is a large ditch not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.270
 overturned good by chance is going to be a 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.080
 hard task withdraw this vehicle from 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.970
 here 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.010
 according to what the driver told us at the time 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.490
 of 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.510
 to get out of the cabin that does not work 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.710
 still in shock 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.420
 for the situation he had lived 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 we are looking at how the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.750
 vehicle doors is a transport of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 fast logistics of the sister republic 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.909
 From Chile 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.649
 here impact can be observed 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.649
 where he hit the hillside 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.640
 a patio of villa turismo 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.550
 and we see how 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.110
 has been this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.110
 Perfect the big truck 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.630
 Jaime the road can be read in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.659
 on your windshield 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 good jaime was very lucky 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.000
 it did not happen to majors either gender 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.000
 victims 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.670
 perhaps the speed of imprudence 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.770
 again 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.450
 they were present 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.590
 here and again a change in Chilean 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.900
 is the one who is giving the note 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.159
 in a morning 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.159
 in the Andean region
