00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
at the point where I actually like

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.080 
at the point where I actually like
people<00:00:42.039> are<00:00:42.129> going<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.309> be<00:00:42.370> ready<00:00:42.550> for<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:42.789> so<00:00:43.059> I

people are going to be ready for it so I

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.610 
people are going to be ready for it so I
actually<00:00:43.300> altered<00:00:43.840> this<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:43.989> little<00:00:44.170> bit<00:00:44.410> and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
actually altered this a little bit and

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.430 
actually altered this a little bit and
it's<00:00:45.100> kind<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.520> same<00:00:45.550> thing<00:00:45.760> but<00:00:46.329> it<00:00:46.449> it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
it's kind of the same thing but it it

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.810 
it's kind of the same thing but it it
has<00:00:47.559> it's<00:00:47.859> kind<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.129> a<00:00:48.219> beastmaster<00:00:48.789> ascension

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
has it's kind of a beastmaster ascension

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.200 
has it's kind of a beastmaster ascension
deck<00:00:49.449> so<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.800> why<00:00:50.949> you<00:00:51.010> see<00:00:51.520> nest<00:00:51.730> invaders

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
deck so that's why you see nest invaders

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.479 
deck so that's why you see nest invaders
here<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.600> anyways<00:00:52.980> we'll<00:00:53.980> see<00:00:54.129> how<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.309> game

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
here so anyways we'll see how this game

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.630 
here so anyways we'll see how this game
goes<00:00:54.550> he<00:00:55.090> molds<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.480> six<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.379> so<00:00:57.070> good<00:00:57.250> decent

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
goes he molds a six so so good decent

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.450 
goes he molds a six so so good decent
start<00:00:58.059> for<00:00:58.300> us<00:00:58.590> turn<00:00:59.590> one<00:00:59.769> plays<00:00:59.980> always<00:01:00.280> the

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
start for us turn one plays always the

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.750 
start for us turn one plays always the
best<00:01:00.640> there's<00:01:01.120> six<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.510> them<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.989> can't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
best there's six of them so you can't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.009 
best there's six of them so you can't
aggressively<00:01:03.760> mulligan<00:01:04.210> into<00:01:04.480> that<00:01:04.660> this

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
aggressively mulligan into that this

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.900 
aggressively mulligan into that this
hand<00:01:05.320> seems<00:01:05.680> decent<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:07.180> fairly<00:01:07.480> aggressive

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
hand seems decent it's fairly aggressive

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.790 
hand seems decent it's fairly aggressive
so<00:01:09.910> we'll<00:01:10.060> see<00:01:10.300> where<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.480> goes<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.500> idea

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
so we'll see where it goes the the idea

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.440 
so we'll see where it goes the the idea
is<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.160> overextend<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.030> there's<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.210> lot

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
is just to overextend and there's a lot

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.330 
is just to overextend and there's a lot
of<00:01:16.480> card<00:01:16.810> advantage<00:01:16.990> in<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.500> stick<00:01:17.770> lead<00:01:18.190> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
of card advantage in the stick lead the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.450 
of card advantage in the stick lead the
Stampede<00:01:18.880> squadron<00:01:19.660> Hawks<00:01:19.980> Nest<00:01:20.980> invader

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
Stampede squadron Hawks Nest invader

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.590 
Stampede squadron Hawks Nest invader
they're<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.880> all<00:01:22.030> sorts<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:24.700> sorts<00:01:25.360> of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
they're just all sorts of all sorts of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.740 
they're just all sorts of all sorts of
card<00:01:25.840> advantage<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:27.210> getting<00:01:28.210> nest<00:01:28.420> invader

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
card advantage so I getting nest invader

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.960 
card advantage so I getting nest invader
online<00:01:29.230> would<00:01:29.890> be<00:01:30.040> nice<00:01:30.250> but<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.670> don't<00:01:30.730> really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
online would be nice but I don't really

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.610 
online would be nice but I don't really
have<00:01:31.120> I<00:01:31.450> mean<00:01:31.510> fauna<00:01:32.230> here<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.040> play

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
have I mean fauna here is the play

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.290 
have I mean fauna here is the play
because<00:01:35.620> we<00:01:35.890> want<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.310> be<00:01:36.460> able<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:40.270> out

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
because we want to be able to get out

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.450 
because we want to be able to get out
something<00:01:40.960> more<00:01:41.440> aggressive<00:01:41.650> against<00:01:42.280> him

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
something more aggressive against him

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.740 
something more aggressive against him
probably<00:01:43.210> Venge<00:01:43.540> vines<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:45.040> per<00:01:45.460> usual<00:01:45.760> so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
probably Venge vines as per usual so

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.990 
probably Venge vines as per usual so
that's<00:01:47.650> not<00:01:47.830> going<00:01:47.980> to<00:01:48.100> happen<00:01:48.250> though<00:01:48.610> but

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
that's not going to happen though but

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.410 
that's not going to happen though but
that's<00:01:49.150> alright<00:01:50.910> leatherback<00:01:51.910> bayloss<00:01:52.240> here

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
that's alright leatherback bayloss here

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.720 
that's alright leatherback bayloss here
is<00:01:52.510> actually<00:01:52.870> fairly<00:01:53.020> aggressive<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.550> we're

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
is actually fairly aggressive so we're

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.980 
is actually fairly aggressive so we're
going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.910> go<00:01:54.970> ahead<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.300> probably<00:01:55.540> drop<00:01:55.750> that

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
going to go ahead and probably drop that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.630 
going to go ahead and probably drop that
I<00:01:56.320> mean<00:01:56.650> he's<00:01:56.830> got<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.160> the<00:01:57.310> doom<00:01:57.460> blade

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
I mean he's got to have the doom blade

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.900 
I mean he's got to have the doom blade
for<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.090> or<00:01:58.210> whatever<00:01:58.480> if<00:01:58.750> he<00:01:59.050> doesn't<00:01:59.470> a

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
for it or whatever if he doesn't a

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.130 
for it or whatever if he doesn't a
pretty<00:02:00.910> good<00:02:01.090> clock<00:02:01.330> against<00:02:01.810> him<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.020> then

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
pretty good clock against him and then

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.780 
pretty good clock against him and then
we<00:02:02.260> can<00:02:02.440> follow<00:02:02.590> up<00:02:02.860> with<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.130> molten<00:02:03.430> tail<00:02:03.580> if

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
we can follow up with the molten tail if

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.600 
we can follow up with the molten tail if
he<00:02:03.880> takes<00:02:04.030> care<00:02:04.330> of<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.540> bay<00:02:05.290> loss<00:02:05.530> this<00:02:06.190> isn't

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
he takes care of the bay loss this isn't

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.309 
he takes care of the bay loss this isn't
generally<00:02:06.940> how<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.240> deck<00:02:07.510> wants<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.020> come<00:02:08.200> out

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
generally how the deck wants to come out

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.910 
generally how the deck wants to come out
ideally<00:02:09.039> but<00:02:10.230> you<00:02:11.230> know<00:02:11.379> not<00:02:11.530> everything's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
ideally but you know not everything's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.220 
ideally but you know not everything's
perfect<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.640> I'd<00:02:12.700> say<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.270> like<00:02:13.599> pretty

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
perfect so I'd say this is like pretty

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.740 
perfect so I'd say this is like pretty
average<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:15.459> nothing<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.819> special<00:02:16.299> or

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
average it's nothing that special or

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.980 
average it's nothing that special or
that<00:02:17.319> awful

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that awful

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.910 
that awful
and<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.260> actually<00:02:20.590> pretty<00:02:20.740> decent

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
and this is actually pretty decent

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.860 
and this is actually pretty decent
because<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.460> keep<00:02:21.580> them<00:02:21.730> off<00:02:21.910> some<00:02:22.150> good

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
because we can keep them off some good

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.390 
because we can keep them off some good
man<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:23.530> we'll<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:23.800> what<00:02:23.890> happens<00:02:24.040> on

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
man I here but we'll see what happens on

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.950 
man I here but we'll see what happens on
the<00:02:24.520> attack<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.700> don't<00:02:31.150> want<00:02:31.270> to<00:02:31.360> nasta

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
the attack so here I don't want to nasta

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.750 
the attack so here I don't want to nasta
kore<00:02:32.140> into<00:02:32.380> like<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> mana<00:02:32.830> leak<00:02:33.040> because<00:02:33.610> I

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
kore into like a mana leak because I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.040 
kore into like a mana leak because I
want<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.090> able<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.330> keep<00:02:34.480> them<00:02:34.630> off<00:02:34.810> his

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
want to be able to keep them off his

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.540 
want to be able to keep them off his
mana<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.710> we're<00:02:35.800> going<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.010> describe<00:02:36.250> nest

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
mana so we're going to describe nest

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.010 
mana so we're going to describe nest
invader<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.200> tech<00:02:38.410> edge<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:40.020> once

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
invader and then the tech edge and once

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.630 
invader and then the tech edge and once
he<00:02:41.110> drops<00:02:41.350> his<00:02:41.500> land<00:02:41.770> probably<00:02:42.190> blow<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.520> up

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
he drops his land probably blow it up

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.660 
he drops his land probably blow it up
but<00:02:42.820> we'll<00:02:42.940> see<00:02:43.150> what<00:02:43.630> he<00:02:43.720> plays<00:02:47.370> that's<00:02:48.370> also

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
but we'll see what he plays that's also

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.770 
but we'll see what he plays that's also
the<00:02:48.790> nice<00:02:48.940> thing<00:02:49.090> about<00:02:49.120> nest<00:02:49.390> invader<00:02:49.660> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the nice thing about nest invader it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.230 
the nice thing about nest invader it
adds<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.080> little<00:02:50.170> extra<00:02:50.350> mana<00:02:50.860> ramp<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:52.030> just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
adds a little extra mana ramp so it just

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.890 
adds a little extra mana ramp so it just
offers<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.630> lot<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:54.390> we'll<00:02:55.390> go<00:02:55.510> ahead<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.690> see

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
offers a lot here we'll go ahead and see

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.150 
offers a lot here we'll go ahead and see
what<00:02:55.930> he<00:02:56.080> does<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.350> Jace<00:02:56.590> first<00:02:56.890> because

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
what he does with Jace first because

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.520 
what he does with Jace first because
he's<00:02:57.370> out<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.730> man<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:58.300> turn<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:58.900> I'll

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
he's out a man of this turn so I'll

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.770 
he's out a man of this turn so I'll
probably<00:02:59.970> bounce<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.240> bailiff<00:03:01.630> yeah<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
probably bounce the bailiff yeah so this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.720 
probably bounce the bailiff yeah so this
is<00:03:04.960> interesting<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.710> mean<00:03:05.740> Jace<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:06.460> going<00:03:06.670> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
is interesting I mean Jace is going to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.540 
is interesting I mean Jace is going to
die<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.750> stick<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.740> mastic<00:03:09.160> or<00:03:09.280> next

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
die and I can stick the mastic or next

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.910 
die and I can stick the mastic or next
turn<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.240> am<00:03:10.720> actually<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.320> blow<00:03:11.590> up

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
turn so I am actually going to blow up

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.240 
turn so I am actually going to blow up
his<00:03:12.540> harp<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.290> keep<00:03:14.530> him<00:03:14.680> off<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.860> double

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
his harp it and keep him off the double

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.370 
his harp it and keep him off the double
blue<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:18.370> he<00:03:19.210> didn't<00:03:19.480> have<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.690> red<00:03:20.110> source

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
blue if he didn't have that red source

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.020 
blue if he didn't have that red source
I'd<00:03:20.650> blow<00:03:20.890> up<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.130> black<00:03:21.340> leave<00:03:21.670> but

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
I'd blow up the black leave but

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.920 
I'd blow up the black leave but
obviously<00:03:22.660> that's<00:03:22.870> not<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.140> case<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:27.930> we'll

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
obviously that's not the case so we'll

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.160 
obviously that's not the case so we'll
go<00:03:29.050> ahead<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.380> kill<00:03:29.590> Jace<00:03:29.860> first<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.930> drop

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
go ahead and kill Jace first then drop

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.710 
go ahead and kill Jace first then drop
the<00:03:32.350> bomb<00:03:32.560> gonna<00:03:33.400> cry<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:33.790> he<00:03:34.150> sees<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.510> mask

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
the bomb gonna cry when he sees the mask

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.470 
the bomb gonna cry when he sees the mask
or<00:03:38.490> we'll<00:03:39.490> see<00:03:39.670> how<00:03:39.730> much<00:03:39.910> just<00:03:40.150> takes<00:03:40.360> over

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
or we'll see how much just takes over

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.600 
or we'll see how much just takes over
the<00:03:40.690> game<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.950> really<00:03:42.160> trying<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.370> get<00:03:42.490> the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
the game I'm really trying to get the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.200 
the game I'm really trying to get the
mana<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.940> work<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:44.260> white<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.860> I've<00:03:45.250> got<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.270 
mana to work the the white is I've got I
