00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
giving up on shows now a few years ago I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.120 
giving up on shows now a few years ago I
would<00:00:11.940> very<00:00:12.330> rarely<00:00:12.509> give<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.559> shows<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
would very rarely give up on shows and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760 
would very rarely give up on shows and
if<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.370> did<00:00:14.700> give<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.179> her<00:00:15.299> show<00:00:15.500> it<00:00:16.500> was

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
if I did give up on her show it was

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.800 
if I did give up on her show it was
because<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> had<00:00:17.400> really<00:00:18.029> stuck<00:00:18.449> through<00:00:18.779> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
because I had really stuck through it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.260 
because I had really stuck through it
and<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:20.010> didn't<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.789> enjoy<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and I just didn't really enjoy it

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.470 
and I just didn't really enjoy it
anymore<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> tended<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> take<00:00:23.820> time<00:00:24.150> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
anymore but it tended to take time for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
anymore but it tended to take time for
me<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.960> give<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> her<00:00:25.590> shelf<00:00:25.859> as

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
me to really give up on her shelf as
