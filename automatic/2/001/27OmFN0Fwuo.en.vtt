00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
level 10 for two years ago and that's a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
level 10 for two years ago and that's a
part<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> design<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.899> joint<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.380> was

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
part of the design with joint is I was

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.359 
part of the design with joint is I was
at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.649> nwt<00:01:56.220> sidewalk<00:01:56.550> USA<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:58.220> we<00:01:59.220> know<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
at the nwt sidewalk USA and we know that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.040 
at the nwt sidewalk USA and we know that
is<00:01:59.790> very<00:01:59.970> specific<00:02:00.420> case<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.780> i<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
is very specific case but i think that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.609 
is very specific case but i think that
high<00:02:01.259> market<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.680> needed<00:02:02.130> some<00:02:03.619> specialty

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
high market also needed some specialty

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.780 
high market also needed some specialty
product<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:08.000> encourage<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.380> consumer<00:02:10.380> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
understand the technology we know maybe

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.310

now they are affordable to buy this but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.350 
now they are affordable to buy this but
the<00:02:16.470> things<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.890> technology<00:02:17.790> always<00:02:17.940> can
