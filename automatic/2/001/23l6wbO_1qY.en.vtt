that's<00:00:05.990> called<00:00:06.230> 2<00:00:06.500> into<00:00:06.799> 1<00:00:06.950> and<00:00:07.190> they<00:00:07.730> would

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
that's called 2 into 1 and they would

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.520 
that's called 2 into 1 and they would
use<00:00:08.059> that<00:00:08.270> as<00:00:08.480> well<00:00:08.690> so<00:00:08.930> whenever<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:09.320> see<00:00:09.350> a

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
use that as well so whenever you see a

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.890 
use that as well so whenever you see a
big<00:00:09.769> chunky<00:00:10.309> single<00:00:10.790> like<00:00:11.299> what<00:00:11.480> you<00:00:11.600> see<00:00:11.809> in

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
big chunky single like what you see in

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.860 
big chunky single like what you see in
the<00:00:12.020> cow

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the cow

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.170 
the cow
mutters<00:00:13.139> that's<00:00:13.800> how<00:00:14.100> they<00:00:14.309> were<00:00:14.370> made<00:00:14.880> rolled

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
mutters that's how they were made rolled

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.780 
mutters that's how they were made rolled
down<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.540> leg<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> looks

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
down the leg like that so that it looks

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.210 
down the leg like that so that it looks
like<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> single<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> truly<00:00:19.170> isn't<00:00:19.560> starts

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
like a single but it truly isn't starts

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.850 
like a single but it truly isn't starts
out<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.610> two<00:00:20.880> pre<00:00:21.390> drafted<00:00:21.960> pieces<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.770> then

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
out with two pre drafted pieces and then

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.589 
out with two pre drafted pieces and then
goes<00:00:23.070> down<00:00:23.099> so<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:23.970> gonna<00:00:24.060> come<00:00:24.270> around<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
goes down so I'm gonna come around and

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.019 
goes down so I'm gonna come around and
give<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> chunk<00:00:25.200> of<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.770> then<00:00:26.669> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
give you a chunk of this and then you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.569 
give you a chunk of this and then you
can<00:00:27.509> practice<00:00:27.990> your<00:00:28.020> thigh<00:00:28.380> spinning<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.250> you

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
can practice your thigh spinning and you

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.850 
can practice your thigh spinning and you
can<00:00:29.790> see<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.450> logical<00:00:31.079> movement<00:00:31.590> where<00:00:31.829> I

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
can see the logical movement where I

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.460 
can see the logical movement where I
grew<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> kid<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.300> movement<00:00:33.930> hadn't

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
grew up as a kid that movement hadn't

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.160 
grew up as a kid that movement hadn't
happened<00:00:34.739> where<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.610> add<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> stick<00:00:36.480> because

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
happened where you add the stick because

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.889 
happened where you add the stick because
the<00:00:37.320> stick<00:00:37.620> gives<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.460> twist<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.239> then

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the stick gives you more twist and then

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
the stick gives you more twist and then
the<00:00:40.200> next<00:00:40.530> thing<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.160> add<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.610> weight<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the next thing is you add a weight that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.819 
the next thing is you add a weight that
gives<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.590> stick<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.520> momentum<00:00:45.269> it's<00:00:45.600> like

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
gives the stick more momentum it's like

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.099 
gives the stick more momentum it's like
that's<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> whirl<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.179> that's<00:00:48.570> why<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
that's what a whirl is and that's why we

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.739 
that's what a whirl is and that's why we
don't<00:00:49.350> cut<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.800> try<00:00:50.519> I<00:00:50.820> mean<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.539> I'm

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
don't cut a try I mean you know I'm

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.840 
don't cut a try I mean you know I'm
gonna<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.469> least<00:00:52.649> 500<00:00:53.219> times<00:00:53.429> in<00:00:53.640> class

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
gonna do it at least 500 times in class

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.049 
gonna do it at least 500 times in class
but<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.870> trying<00:00:55.499> trying<00:00:55.829> trying<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.760> remember

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
but I trying trying trying to remember

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.139 
but I trying trying trying to remember
to<00:00:57.780> call<00:00:58.079> what's<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.129> wheel<00:00:59.429> a<00:00:59.670> pulley

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to call what's on your wheel a pulley

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
to call what's on your wheel a pulley
it's<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.170> transfers<00:01:01.829> power<00:01:02.370> from

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's the thing that transfers power from

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's the thing that transfers power from
one<00:01:02.999> circle<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> next<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
one circle to the next and then to the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.160 
one circle to the next and then to the
shaft<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.330> world<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
shaft that's not what a world does a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.340 
shaft that's not what a world does a
world<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> weight<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.510> works<00:01:09.750> by<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.080> not

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
world is a weight but it works by it not

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
world is a weight but it works by it not
by<00:01:10.620> size<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> weight<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.720> weight

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
by size but the weight and the weight

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.430 
by size but the weight and the weight
causes<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.010> stick<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.120> revolve<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:15.840> but

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
causes the stick to revolve more but

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380 
causes the stick to revolve more but
it's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.770> stick<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.460> putting<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> twist

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's a stick that's putting in the twist

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's a stick that's putting in the twist
with<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> pulley<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.950> pulley<00:01:20.190> controls<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
with the pulley the pulley controls the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.400 
with the pulley the pulley controls the
twist<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:22.200> than<00:01:23.060> then<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.480> whirl<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
twist more than then the whirl would the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.370 
twist more than then the whirl would the
world<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.980> makes<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.850> last<00:01:27.090> longer<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:28.260> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
world just makes it last longer but it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
world just makes it last longer but it
doesn't<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.160> twist<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> shaft<00:01:29.940> on<00:01:30.330> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
doesn't make the twist the shaft on a

doesn't make the twist the shaft on a
spindle<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.440> makes<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> twist<00:01:32.120> small

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
spindle is what makes the twist small

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.800 
spindle is what makes the twist small
shaft<00:01:33.590> high<00:01:34.590> twist<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.490> shaft<00:01:35.850> Lotus

try thigh spinning strip it down a bit
it'll<00:01:42.300> be<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.660> easier<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:43.320> start<00:01:43.560> out

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
it'll be a little easier to start out

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.120 
it'll be a little easier to start out

with<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:21.959> these<00:02:22.019> elaborate<00:02:22.680> schemes<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
with all these elaborate schemes to

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.759 
with all these elaborate schemes to
remember<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:24.480> spinners<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.260> makes<00:02:25.439> a<00:02:25.590> lot

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
remember it for spinners it makes a lot

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.580 
remember it for spinners it makes a lot
more<00:02:25.799> sense

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
more sense

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.920 
more sense
to<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.760> about<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.750> left

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
to think about it is right and left

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.540 
to think about it is right and left
because<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.470> turn<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.950> wheel<00:02:30.160> in<00:02:30.400> that

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
because we turn the wheel in that

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.339 
because we turn the wheel in that
direction<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.360> right<00:02:31.569> down<00:02:31.780> twist<00:02:32.140> we

direction to get a right down twist we

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.020 
direction to get a right down twist we
turn<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.680> wheel<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.069> left<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.610> get<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> left

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
turn the wheel to the left to get a left

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000 
turn the wheel to the left to get a left
town<00:02:34.269> twist<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.440> just<00:02:35.620> remove<00:02:35.800> a
