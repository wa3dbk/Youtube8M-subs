00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 or the people of the cyberworld today I come to you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.410
 with a sonic curiosity if I 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.990
 I mean the message hidden in the game 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.750
 sonic headquarters to access we have to go 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 to sound tests to get to the sound test 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.520
 at the beginning of the game we have to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.070
 press down down up right and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 finally press start if you did 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 well a sound will sound when you grab a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.859
 ring 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.750
 once in the sound test we are going to put 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.750
 the numbers how the video will look 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.580
 as we can appreciate the background of the 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.640
 screen there is a sound with an ugly face 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.740
 some letters in Japanese that some do not 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 they know finally the background music that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.100
 is when you fight the boss ending that is 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.100
 something disturbing 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 best 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.040
 you're probably wondering what 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.580
 says that good message I'm going to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.180
 translate says the fun is infinite 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.549
 companies are gas greetings satanas good 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.740
 This means that there is something 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.869
 won wants us to know or can it be a 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.440
 joke since the Japanese do not believe in 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.080
 the religion nor in the good devil I hope 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.330
