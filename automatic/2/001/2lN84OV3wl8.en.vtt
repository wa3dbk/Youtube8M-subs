00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
can go back and forth it's a little

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.389 
can go back and forth it's a little
difficult<00:01:17.200> from<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.619> angle<00:01:17.950> on<00:01:18.009> that<00:01:18.159> but

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
difficult from the angle on that but

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.770 
difficult from the angle on that but
it's<00:01:18.579> pretty<00:01:18.729> easy<00:01:19.000> when<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.299> have<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.420> free

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
it's pretty easy when you have a free

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's pretty easy when you have a free
range<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.229> motion<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:20.920> see<00:01:21.039> it<00:01:21.130> works

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
range of motion so you can see it works

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760 
range of motion so you can see it works
very<00:01:21.729> well<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.869> hard<00:01:23.049> going<00:01:23.170> back<00:01:23.409> in<00:01:23.649> this

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
very well it's hard going back in this

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.010 
very well it's hard going back in this
angle<00:01:24.009> but<00:01:24.549> so<00:01:24.969> you<00:01:25.060> have<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.329> option<00:01:25.539> not

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
angle but so you have that option not

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.510 
angle but so you have that option not
only<00:01:26.079> do<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.409> have<00:01:26.439> wrist<00:01:26.770> gestures<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.399> also

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
only do you have wrist gestures you also

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
do as well so within this settings let's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.640 
do as well so within this settings let's
go<00:02:40.330> ahead<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.540> show<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.900> ambient<00:02:41.470> mode

go ahead and show you that ambient mode
within<00:02:42.040> apps<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.460> if<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.610> go<00:02:42.730> into<00:02:42.880> maps<00:02:43.210> that's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
within apps so if I go into maps that's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.300 
within apps so if I go into maps that's
actually<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.260> them<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.920> has<00:02:45.160> that

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
actually one of them that has that

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.449 
actually one of them that has that
option<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.030> let<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.620> dim<00:02:47.620> okay

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
option so I'm going to let it dim okay

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.130 
option so I'm going to let it dim okay

so you see it's a little dark but it is
an<00:02:50.320> ambient<00:02:50.770> mode<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.070> works<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.550> Google

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
an ambient mode it works with Google

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.460 
an ambient mode it works with Google
keep<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.270> well<00:02:52.420> it's<00:02:52.570> another<00:02:52.690> app<00:02:52.990> that<00:02:53.020> works
