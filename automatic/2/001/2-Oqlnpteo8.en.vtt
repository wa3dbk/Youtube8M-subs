00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
is pretty much dead but if I can bring
damage<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> shell<00:01:47.939> tiem<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.720> using<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
damage to the shell tiem by using a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.560 
damage to the shell tiem by using a
extreme<00:01:49.799> speed<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.729> would<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.360> nice<00:01:51.509> for

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
extreme speed that would be so nice for

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.010 
extreme speed that would be so nice for
me<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.710> my<00:01:53.100> Lucario<00:01:53.549> dies<00:01:53.880> after<00:01:54.210> finishing<00:01:54.780> up

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
me so my Lucario dies after finishing up

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
me so my Lucario dies after finishing up
Mamoswine<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> bring<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:57.320> Jolteon<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> Cesar

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
Mamoswine and bring a Jolteon and Cesar

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
Mamoswine and bring a Jolteon and Cesar
to<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.430> yellow<00:01:59.729> he'll<00:02:00.180> hit<00:02:00.360> points<00:02:00.829> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
to like yellow he'll hit points so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.420 
to like yellow he'll hit points so
Lucario<00:02:02.579> kicked<00:02:03.060> ass<00:02:03.649> now<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> decided<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.310> go

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
Lucario kicked ass now I decided to go

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.719 
Lucario kicked ass now I decided to go
for<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.969> stealth<00:02:06.719> rocks<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.860> he<00:02:08.099> decides<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> go

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
for a stealth rocks but he decides to go

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
for a stealth rocks but he decides to go
for<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.030> thunderbolt<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> life<00:02:10.200> orb

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
for a thunderbolt I see the life orb

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
for a thunderbolt I see the life orb
which<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.950> always<00:02:11.160> nice<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> thought<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
which is always nice here I thought that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.690 
which is always nice here I thought that
he<00:02:13.290> would

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
he would

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.280 
he would
for<00:02:13.970> another<00:02:14.120> Thunderbolt<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.810> finish<00:02:15.080> me<00:02:15.260> off

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
for another Thunderbolt to finish me off

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.619 
for another Thunderbolt to finish me off
but<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.069> goes<00:02:16.190> for<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> hidden<00:02:16.700> power<00:02:16.970> which

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
but it goes for a hidden power which

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.130 
but it goes for a hidden power which
isn't<00:02:18.110> too<00:02:18.319> great<00:02:18.500> for<00:02:18.650> me<00:02:19.420> however<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.510> take<00:02:20.959> it

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
isn't too great for me however I take it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.990 
isn't too great for me however I take it
like<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.379> champ<00:02:21.560> while<00:02:22.340> he<00:02:22.519> goes<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.879> another

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
like a champ while he goes to another

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.780 
like a champ while he goes to another
shadow<00:02:23.360> ball<00:02:23.650> obviously<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.680> don't<00:02:25.160> want<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.610> go

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
shadow ball obviously I don't want to go

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.140 
shadow ball obviously I don't want to go
for<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> thunderbolt<00:02:28.459> because<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
for for a thunderbolt because of the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.270 
for for a thunderbolt because of the
volt<00:02:29.599> absorb<00:02:29.959> he<00:02:30.200> would<00:02:30.349> heal<00:02:30.530> his<00:02:30.709> hit<00:02:30.890> points

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
volt absorb he would heal his hit points

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.160 
volt absorb he would heal his hit points
so<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:31.910> decided<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.300> go<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.630> hidden<00:02:32.870> power<00:02:33.080> of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
so I decided to go for a hidden power of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.110 
so I decided to go for a hidden power of
my<00:02:33.440> own<00:02:33.620> not<00:02:33.920> revealing<00:02:34.370> what<00:02:34.580> kind<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:34.910> hidden

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
my own not revealing what kind of hidden

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.210 
my own not revealing what kind of hidden
power<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.709> didn't<00:02:37.010> want<00:02:37.069> to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
power it is and because I didn't want to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.789 
power it is and because I didn't want to
reveal<00:02:37.459> my<00:02:37.790> signal<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.360> Mia<00:02:38.569> however<00:02:39.349> he<00:02:39.560> goes

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
reveal my signal be Mia however he goes

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.070 
reveal my signal be Mia however he goes
into<00:02:40.099> scissor<00:02:40.400> goes<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> revenge<00:02:41.750> kill

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
into scissor goes for the revenge kill

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.619 
into scissor goes for the revenge kill
and<00:02:42.319> yeah<00:02:43.129> that's<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.580> dead<00:02:43.760> jolteon<00:02:44.269> too<00:02:44.450> bad

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
and yeah that's the dead jolteon too bad

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.740 
and yeah that's the dead jolteon too bad
no<00:02:44.989> jolteon<00:02:45.500> sweep<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:46.010> time<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> now<00:02:47.540> i'm

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
no jolteon sweep this time so now i'm

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.479 
no jolteon sweep this time so now i'm
pretty<00:02:48.140> sure<00:02:48.380> i<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.739> live<00:02:48.950> another<00:02:49.130> boat

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
pretty sure i can live another boat

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.400 
pretty sure i can live another boat
punch<00:02:49.819> but<00:02:50.120> actually<00:02:50.330> i<00:02:50.540> was<00:02:50.780> predicting<00:02:51.260> him

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
punch but actually i was predicting him

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.020 
punch but actually i was predicting him
to<00:02:51.590> switch<00:02:51.829> out<00:02:52.069> into<00:02:52.459> something<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:52.910> can

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
to switch out into something that can

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.930 
to switch out into something that can
take<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.900> Fire<00:02:54.140> Blast<00:02:54.349> like<00:02:55.010> something<00:02:55.549> like

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
take the Fire Blast like something like

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.809 
take the Fire Blast like something like
a<00:02:56.239> heat<00:02:56.569> run<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.900> his<00:02:57.019> own<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:58.190> um<00:02:58.430> that

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
a heat run of his own but um that

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.610 
a heat run of his own but um that
doesn't<00:02:59.150> happen<00:02:59.510> he<00:02:59.870> goes<00:03:00.079> for<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.349> bullet

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
doesn't happen he goes for a bullet

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.890 
doesn't happen he goes for a bullet
punch<00:03:00.799> doesn't<00:03:01.370> quite<00:03:01.519> finish<00:03:01.880> me<00:03:02.030> off<00:03:02.060> here

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
punch doesn't quite finish me off here

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.259 
punch doesn't quite finish me off here
he<00:03:02.989> goes<00:03:03.019> into<00:03:03.410> gengar<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.190> he<00:03:04.760> goes<00:03:05.000> for<00:03:05.209> a

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
he goes into gengar and he goes for a

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.180 
he goes into gengar and he goes for a
focus<00:03:05.750> blast<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.349> was<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> crucial<00:03:06.860> part

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
focus blast and this was a crucial part

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.190 
focus blast and this was a crucial part
of<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> game<00:03:07.610> he<00:03:07.880> missed<00:03:08.180> he<00:03:08.870> missed<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
of the game he missed he missed the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.670 
of the game he missed he missed the
focus<00:03:09.650> blast<00:03:09.940> bird<00:03:10.940> am<00:03:11.239> actually<00:03:11.660> it's<00:03:12.290> not

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
focus blast bird am actually it's not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.550 
focus blast bird am actually it's not
that<00:03:12.980> crucial<00:03:13.640> because<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:15.049> still<00:03:15.349> have<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
that crucial because I still have a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.470 
that crucial because I still have a
scissor<00:03:16.069> which<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.579> easily<00:03:16.760> come<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.299> and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
scissor which can easily come in and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.180 
scissor which can easily come in and
revenge<00:03:17.780> killing<00:03:18.109> with<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> bullet<00:03:18.470> punch<00:03:18.739> and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
revenge killing with a bullet punch and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.190 
revenge killing with a bullet punch and
you'll<00:03:19.609> see<00:03:19.819> i'll<00:03:20.000> get<00:03:20.239> some<00:03:20.510> hacks<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:21.049> the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
you'll see i'll get some hacks in the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.590 
you'll see i'll get some hacks in the
following<00:03:21.530> turns<00:03:21.950> which<00:03:22.459> totally<00:03:23.000> makes<00:03:23.030> up

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
following turns which totally makes up

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.650 
following turns which totally makes up
for<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:23.989> Miss<00:03:24.790> he<00:03:25.790> goes<00:03:25.970> into<00:03:26.209> salamence

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
for the Miss he goes into salamence

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.800 
for the Miss he goes into salamence
salamence<00:03:27.230> gets<00:03:27.440> raped<00:03:27.709> by<00:03:27.889> sell<00:03:28.190> trucks<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
salamence gets raped by sell trucks I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.300 
salamence gets raped by sell trucks I
stay<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.019> because<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.530> basically<00:03:30.739> have<00:03:31.130> nothing

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
stay in because I basically have nothing

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.420 
stay in because I basically have nothing
better<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.880> do<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:33.109> decide<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.799> go<00:03:34.069> for<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
better to do and I decide to go for the
