00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
leaving these cucumber so would be

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.630 
leaving these cucumber so would be
radishes<00:01:59.689> spring<00:02:00.689> onions<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
radishes spring onions so that's all

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.069 
radishes spring onions so that's all
doing<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.000> well<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.719> peace<00:02:03.899> with

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
doing really well it's really peace with

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
doing really well it's really peace with

I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.770> gonna<00:02:07.860> help<00:02:08.039> grow<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> pot<00:02:08.610> but

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
I think it's gonna help grow the pot but

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
I think it's gonna help grow the pot but
we'll<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.599> how<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> might<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
we'll see how they go I might have to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.839 
we'll see how they go I might have to
just<00:02:10.619> push<00:02:10.830> them<00:02:11.009> over<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> side<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
just push them over the side there and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.430 
just push them over the side there and
let<00:02:11.940> them<00:02:12.060> grow

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
let them grow

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.440 
let them grow

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
with it I've planted some pickled onions

in here I just did that yesterday as

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
well over here iceberg lettuce here

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.250 
well over here iceberg lettuce here

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
of lettuces here spring young is near

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.800 
of lettuces here spring young is near
this<00:02:36.530> tomato<00:02:36.830> here<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.550> gone<00:02:37.700> nuts<00:02:38.180> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
this tomato here is just gone nuts and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.880 
this tomato here is just gone nuts and
if<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.740> can't<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:40.520> on<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> other<00:02:41.150> side

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
if you can't see but on the other side

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.140 
if you can't see but on the other side
you<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.160> see<00:02:43.490> where<00:02:43.730> its<00:02:43.850> roots

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
you can actually see where its roots

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.810 
you can actually see where its roots
have<00:02:44.270> gone<00:02:44.620> down<00:02:45.620> through<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.190> through<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
have gone down through the through the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.510 
have gone down through the through the
dirt<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.420> into<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> water<00:02:48.080> which<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.190> really

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
dirt and into the water which is really

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.830 
dirt and into the water which is really
pleasing<00:02:49.880> because<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.150> was<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.360> whole<00:02:50.510> idea

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
pleasing because it was the whole idea

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.460 
pleasing because it was the whole idea
of<00:02:50.900> having<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.860> water<00:02:52.040> sit<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.520> bottom

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
of having the water sit in the bottom

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.000 
of having the water sit in the bottom
which<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.500> good<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.260> seen<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.620> part<00:02:57.830> one

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
which is good if you seen on part one

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.140 
which is good if you seen on part one
you'll<00:02:58.190> notice<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.390> got<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:01.090> couple<00:03:02.090> of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you'll notice that of got a couple of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150 
you'll notice that of got a couple of
lids<00:03:02.330> up<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.690> these<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.290> put<00:03:03.560> them<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.800> in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
lids up on these and put them in in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.730 
lids up on these and put them in in
about<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.730> level<00:03:05.120> they're<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:06.320> above<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
about that level they're just above the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.360 
about that level they're just above the
water<00:03:06.920> line<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:08.560> whether<00:03:09.560> he<00:03:09.770> beholds<00:03:10.160> in<00:03:10.250> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
water line and whether he beholds in it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.560 
water line and whether he beholds in it
so<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.580> roots<00:03:10.760> can<00:03:10.820> actually<00:03:11.240> grow<00:03:11.360> down<00:03:11.540> into

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
so the roots can actually grow down into

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.970 
so the roots can actually grow down into
the<00:03:11.840> water<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> they<00:03:12.260> can<00:03:12.410> get<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.620> much<00:03:12.740> water

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the water and they can get in much water

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.740 
the water and they can get in much water
so<00:03:13.070> once<00:03:13.430> I'd<00:03:13.820> have<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.030> do<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.570> together

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
so once I'd have to do that together

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.980 
so once I'd have to do that together
much<00:03:15.050> water<00:03:16.330> probably<00:03:17.330> can't<00:03:17.570> see<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:17.810> you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
much water probably can't see but you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.199 
much water probably can't see but you
can<00:03:18.110> actually<00:03:18.230> see<00:03:18.530> roots<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:19.730> all<00:03:19.820> full<00:03:20.120> of

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
can actually see roots it's all full of

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.990 
can actually see roots it's all full of
roots<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.630> here

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
roots in here

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.250 
roots in here
yeah<00:03:23.000> these<00:03:23.180> mother<00:03:23.420> comodo<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.050> I<00:03:24.080> grew

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
yeah these mother comodo that I grew

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.490 
yeah these mother comodo that I grew
from<00:03:24.410> seed<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:24.740> they're<00:03:25.010> not<00:03:25.100> doing<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:25.790> well

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
from seed but they're not doing so well

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.930 
from seed but they're not doing so well
small<00:03:27.500> instances<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.130> baby<00:03:28.280> carrots<00:03:28.730> and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
small instances and baby carrots and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.280 
small instances and baby carrots and
then<00:03:29.270> cucumber<00:03:31.510> yes<00:03:32.510> that's<00:03:32.810> basically<00:03:33.170> about

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
then cucumber yes that's basically about

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.199 
then cucumber yes that's basically about
it<00:03:33.650> all<00:03:33.950> seems<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.250> be<00:03:34.340> growing<00:03:34.550> pretty<00:03:34.820> well<00:03:34.880> I

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
it all seems to be growing pretty well I

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.360 
it all seems to be growing pretty well I
just<00:03:35.480> got<00:03:36.080> back<00:03:36.230> from<00:03:36.290> teen<00:03:36.650> days<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.100> New
