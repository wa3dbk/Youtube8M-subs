00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
sweeper and we have gold which can
pretty<00:00:23.490> much<00:00:23.580> upgrade<00:00:24.029> anything<00:00:24.630> like

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
pretty much upgrade anything like

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
pretty much upgrade anything like
literally<00:00:25.080> anything<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> base<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.070> I'm

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
literally anything in the base so I'm

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
literally anything in the base so I'm
not<00:00:26.849> too<00:00:26.970> sure<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.240> should<00:00:27.269> raid<00:00:27.810> because<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
not too sure if I should raid because I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.929 
not too sure if I should raid because I
mean<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> would<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> waste<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
mean like it would be a waste that we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.209 
mean like it would be a waste that we
finally<00:00:30.269> 300<00:00:30.689> K<00:00:30.779> gold<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.679> can't<00:00:31.980> get

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
finally 300 K gold and then we can't get

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220 
finally 300 K gold and then we can't get
it<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> upgrade<00:00:33.570> regardless

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it so we have to upgrade regardless

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.360 
it so we have to upgrade regardless
