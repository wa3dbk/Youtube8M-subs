00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
few weeks ago here I'm on my knees I'm

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.490 
few weeks ago here I'm on my knees I'm
casting<00:00:19.199> sort<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:20.060> sideways<00:00:21.060> sight<00:00:21.509> casting

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
casting sort of sideways sight casting

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.499 
casting sort of sideways sight casting
if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:22.949> towards<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.820> head<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.150> his<00:00:24.240> pool

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
if you will towards the head of his pool

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.339 
if you will towards the head of his pool
I<00:00:24.859> can't<00:00:25.859> cast<00:00:26.160> overhead<00:00:27.089> because<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.779> some

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I can't cast overhead because of some

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.919 
I can't cast overhead because of some
branches<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> had<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> cast<00:00:29.759> more<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
branches so I had to cast more of like a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.460 
branches so I had to cast more of like a
sideways<00:00:31.650> cast<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> hook<00:00:34.170> into<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
sideways cast you can see I hook into a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.460 
sideways cast you can see I hook into a
fish<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:35.340> where<00:00:35.880> those<00:00:36.000> roots<00:00:36.329> were<00:00:36.510> shoots

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
fish right where those roots were shoots

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.610 
fish right where those roots were shoots
out<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> main<00:00:38.040> part<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> pool<00:00:39.380> and<00:00:40.380> I'm

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
out to the main part of the pool and I'm

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.140 
out to the main part of the pool and I'm
gonna<00:00:40.740> try<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> direct<00:00:41.430> him<00:00:41.550> over<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
gonna try to direct him over into this

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.030 
gonna try to direct him over into this
current<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.720> you<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.380> left<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.950> then

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
current that you see on my left and then

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
current that you see on my left and then
I<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.370> bring<00:00:44.580> him<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> net<00:00:45.500> without<00:00:46.500> me

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
I can bring him into the net without me

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
I can bring him into the net without me
having<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.400> move<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.450> right

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
having to get the move you can see right

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.210 
having to get the move you can see right
there<00:00:48.750> my<00:00:49.110> rod<00:00:49.440> hitting<00:00:49.860> some<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
there my rod hitting some of the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.670 
there my rod hitting some of the
branches<00:00:50.460> overhead<00:00:51.080> that's<00:00:52.080> always<00:00:52.290> very

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
branches overhead that's always very

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
branches overhead that's always very
frustrating<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:53.790> trying<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.090> fight

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
frustrating when you're trying to fight

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:10.080 
frustrating when you're trying to fight
a<00:00:54.600> fish

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.750 

and<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:11.210> fish<00:01:11.420> turns<00:01:11.659> out<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.900> be<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.050> brown

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
and this fish turns out to be a brown

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.160 
and this fish turns out to be a brown
compared<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.909> my<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.450> opening<00:01:14.750> of<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.960> net

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
compared to my the opening of the net

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.950 
compared to my the opening of the net
it's<00:01:15.440> about<00:01:15.650> 10<00:01:15.950> inches<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.550> it's<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.970> nice<00:01:17.600> fish

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
it's about 10 inches so it's a nice fish

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's about 10 inches so it's a nice fish
for<00:01:18.190> this<00:01:19.190> very<00:01:19.940> shallow<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.660> small<00:01:21.170> water

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.060 

this<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.500> interesting

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
this is interesting

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.750 
this is interesting
I'm<00:01:28.870> upstream<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:30.890> want<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.160> cast<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.610> this

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
I'm upstream and I want to cast to this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.910 
I'm upstream and I want to cast to this
pool<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.540> can<00:01:32.720> see<00:01:32.900> down<00:01:33.410> there<00:01:33.620> on<00:01:33.710> my

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
pool that you can see down there on my

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.440 
pool that you can see down there on my
right<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.550> cast<00:01:35.000> down<00:01:35.950> towards<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.450> fast

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
right so I cast down towards the fast

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.780 
right so I cast down towards the fast
water<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.020> go<00:01:39.290> fly<00:01:39.650> swept<00:01:40.040> around<00:01:40.340> into<00:01:40.640> that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
water and go fly swept around into that

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.290 
water and go fly swept around into that
area<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.340> actually<00:01:43.340> hook<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.700> fish<00:01:43.970> out<00:01:44.240> of

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
area and actually hook a fish out of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.250 
area and actually hook a fish out of
sight<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.229> then<00:01:45.950> bring<00:01:46.250> him<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.930> there's<00:01:47.930> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
sight and then bring him up there's the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.320 
sight and then bring him up there's the
bank<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.620> rather<00:01:48.800> steep<00:01:49.100> here<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.090> actually

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
bank is rather steep here so I actually

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:10.860 
bank is rather steep here so I actually
had<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.630> lift<00:01:50.870> him<00:01:51.050> up<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:53.800> into<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.890> net

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.120 

it<00:02:11.870> turns<00:02:12.110> out<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.350> be<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> nice<00:02:12.710> colorful

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it turns out to be a nice colorful

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:21.520 
it turns out to be a nice colorful
rainbow<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.610> segment<00:02:20.120> I'm<00:02:20.990> gonna<00:02:21.290> do<00:02:21.500> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
rainbow in this segment I'm gonna do a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.320 
rainbow in this segment I'm gonna do a
bow<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:21.920> arrow<00:02:22.070> cast<00:02:22.520> as<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.180> see

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
bow and arrow cast as you can see

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.120 
bow and arrow cast as you can see
there's<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.750> bow<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> arrow<00:02:24.170> cast<00:02:24.830> right

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
there's the bow and arrow cast right

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.850 
there's the bow and arrow cast right
there<00:02:25.370> getting<00:02:25.640> ready<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.940> go<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:27.350> fling<00:02:27.830> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
there getting ready to go and fling it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.980 
there getting ready to go and fling it
out<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> head<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.060> pool<00:02:29.300> I've<00:02:29.750> got<00:02:29.960> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
out to the head of the pool I've got a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.050 
out to the head of the pool I've got a
branch<00:02:30.350> directly<00:02:30.950> over<00:02:31.160> my<00:02:31.190> head<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.700> can't

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
branch directly over my head so I can't

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.020 
branch directly over my head so I can't
cast<00:02:32.860> upwards<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.130> straight<00:02:34.490> out<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:34.880> they

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
cast upwards and straight out like they

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.870 
cast upwards and straight out like they
typically<00:02:35.390> would<00:02:36.100> slowly<00:02:37.100> lift<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.400> rod<00:02:37.640> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
typically would slowly lift the rod and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.440 
typically would slowly lift the rod and
guide<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.270> fly<00:02:38.450> back<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.020> me<00:02:39.400> touch<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.760> get

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
guide the fly back to me touch the get

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.760 
guide the fly back to me touch the get
the<00:02:41.570> line<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.140> do<00:02:42.290> another<00:02:42.530> cast<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:43.610> and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
the line and do another cast here and

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.320 
the line and do another cast here and
shoot<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.160> head<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.460> pool<00:02:46.700> lift

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
shoot it to the head of the pool lift

the rod tip the fish is going to take it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:30.270 
the rod tip the fish is going to take it
right<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:50.420> at<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.630> head<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.990> pool

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.830 

here<00:03:31.280> I've<00:03:31.430> moved<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.819> different<00:03:31.880> stream<00:03:32.510> a

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
here I've moved to a different stream a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.320 
here I've moved to a different stream a
few<00:03:33.230> miles<00:03:33.470> north<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.490> previous<00:03:34.790> streams

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
few miles north of that previous streams

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.449 
few miles north of that previous streams
on<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.810> same<00:03:36.020> day<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.560> Sun<00:03:36.830> came<00:03:37.069> out<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
on the same day the Sun came out and

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.880 
on the same day the Sun came out and
actually<00:03:37.580> warmed<00:03:38.090> up<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:39.230> water<00:03:39.440> slow<00:03:39.709> and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
actually warmed up the water slow and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:52.410 
actually warmed up the water slow and
clear<00:03:40.130> making<00:03:40.750> stealth<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:42.050> mas

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.930 

here's<00:03:53.420> another<00:03:53.740> fish<00:03:54.740> taken<00:03:55.250> just<00:03:55.670> above

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
here's another fish taken just above

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.730 
here's another fish taken just above
just<00:03:56.209> upstream<00:03:56.720> from<00:03:56.930> those<00:03:57.110> rocks<00:03:57.410> do<00:03:57.650> you

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
just upstream from those rocks do you

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:24.090 
just upstream from those rocks do you
see<00:03:58.690> just<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.959> right<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.290> midstream

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.950 

this<00:04:25.100> rainbow<00:04:25.370> gets<00:04:25.729> up<00:04:25.910> just<00:04:25.940> before<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.720> go<00:04:26.900> to

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
this rainbow gets up just before I go to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.710 
this rainbow gets up just before I go to
net<00:04:27.229> him<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.820> gets<00:04:28.820> back<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.240> water<00:04:29.419> right

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
net him and gets back in the water right

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:53.550 
net him and gets back in the water right
there

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.649 

there's<00:04:54.560> just<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.919> teeny<00:04:55.250> little<00:04:55.370> guy<00:04:55.759> it's

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
there's just a teeny little guy it's

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:04.869 
there's just a teeny little guy it's
still<00:04:56.810> fun<00:04:57.020> though

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.059 

so<00:05:05.879> upstream<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.360> came<00:05:06.569> across<00:05:06.689> this<00:05:07.199> wider

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
so upstream I came across this wider

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.600 
so upstream I came across this wider
area<00:05:08.569> that<00:05:09.569> had<00:05:09.749> been<00:05:09.919> widened<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.189> dammed

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
area that had been widened and dammed

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.570 
area that had been widened and dammed
probably<00:05:12.300> by<00:05:12.389> some<00:05:12.659> summer<00:05:12.930> campers<00:05:13.580> created

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
probably by some summer campers created

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.609 
probably by some summer campers created
this<00:05:14.669> really<00:05:15.059> clear<00:05:15.419> pool<00:05:15.839> you<00:05:16.199> can<00:05:16.319> see<00:05:16.499> how

00:05:16.609 --> 00:05:16.619 
this really clear pool you can see how

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:20.839 
this really clear pool you can see how
clear<00:05:17.039> it<00:05:17.159> is<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.990> did<00:05:19.680> hook<00:05:19.949> a<00:05:20.099> few<00:05:20.309> fish<00:05:20.550> on<00:05:20.729> the

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
clear it is I did hook a few fish on the

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.969 
clear it is I did hook a few fish on the
way<00:05:20.969> up<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.779> here<00:05:22.349> I'm<00:05:22.439> trying<00:05:22.619> to<00:05:22.770> wait

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
way up and here I'm trying to wait

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.010 
way up and here I'm trying to wait
slowly<00:05:23.339> to<00:05:23.639> diminish<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.449> amount<00:05:24.599> of<00:05:24.719> waves

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
slowly to diminish the amount of waves

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.239 
slowly to diminish the amount of waves
that<00:05:25.229> I'm<00:05:25.379> causing<00:05:25.649> but<00:05:26.249> I'm<00:05:26.339> casting<00:05:26.899> to<00:05:27.899> just

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 
that I'm causing but I'm casting to just

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.459 
that I'm causing but I'm casting to just
upstream<00:05:29.249> from<00:05:29.520> that<00:05:30.050> Alton<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.199> rock<00:05:31.439> that

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
upstream from that Alton that rock that

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.529 
upstream from that Alton that rock that
you<00:05:31.710> see<00:05:32.069> so<00:05:32.490> right<00:05:32.729> there<00:05:33.089> because<00:05:33.330> there's

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
you see so right there because there's

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.959 
you see so right there because there's
got<00:05:33.689> to<00:05:33.779> be<00:05:33.809> a<00:05:33.899> fish<00:05:34.229> surfing<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.279> current<00:05:35.639> on

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
got to be a fish surfing the current on

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.230 
got to be a fish surfing the current on
the<00:05:36.149> upstream<00:05:36.539> side<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:38.059> short<00:05:39.059> enough<00:05:39.209> to

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
the upstream side and short enough to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.540 
the upstream side and short enough to
hook<00:05:39.539> into<00:05:39.719> him<00:05:39.899> right<00:05:40.050> there<00:05:40.289> and<00:05:40.430> bring<00:05:41.430> him

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
hook into him right there and bring him

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:58.549 
hook into him right there and bring him
up<00:05:41.669> over<00:05:41.999> and<00:05:42.180> then<00:05:43.169> to<00:05:43.409> hand

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.739 

he<00:05:59.559> turns<00:05:59.800> out<00:05:59.949> to<00:06:00.009> be<00:06:00.159> a<00:06:00.309> handsome<00:06:01.239> brown

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:01.749 
he turns out to be a handsome brown

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:10.699 
he turns out to be a handsome brown
again<00:06:02.619> about<00:06:02.860> 10<00:06:03.459> inches<00:06:03.999> maybe<00:06:04.869> 11<00:06:05.439> the<00:06:05.919> most

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:10.709 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.489 

so<00:06:11.709> as<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:11.919> can<00:06:12.009> tell<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:12.339> waters<00:06:12.669> very

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:13.499 
so as you can tell the waters very

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.689 
so as you can tell the waters very
shallow<00:06:14.499> but<00:06:15.159> don't<00:06:15.669> overlook<00:06:17.550> places<00:06:18.550> where

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
shallow but don't overlook places where

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.219 
shallow but don't overlook places where
fish<00:06:18.879> could<00:06:19.059> lie<00:06:19.209> right<00:06:19.569> there<00:06:19.809> in<00:06:19.929> front<00:06:20.110> of

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
fish could lie right there in front of

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.559 
fish could lie right there in front of
that<00:06:20.289> rock<00:06:20.709> is<00:06:21.039> where<00:06:21.189> I<00:06:21.219> placed<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.789> fly<00:06:22.029> and

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
that rock is where I placed the fly and

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.329 
that rock is where I placed the fly and
sure<00:06:23.199> enough<00:06:23.229> there<00:06:23.559> happens<00:06:23.889> to<00:06:23.919> be<00:06:23.979> a<00:06:24.069> fish

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:24.339 
sure enough there happens to be a fish

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.829 
sure enough there happens to be a fish
there<00:06:24.610> he<00:06:25.179> must<00:06:25.330> have<00:06:25.479> been<00:06:25.599> sitting

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
there he must have been sitting

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:28.549 
there he must have been sitting
literally<00:06:26.349> in<00:06:26.709> a<00:06:26.830> couple<00:06:27.009> inches<00:06:27.309> of<00:06:27.519> water

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:28.559 
literally in a couple inches of water

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:31.679 
literally in a couple inches of water
but<00:06:29.909> when<00:06:30.909> you're<00:06:31.029> fishing<00:06:31.179> these<00:06:31.389> small

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:31.689 
but when you're fishing these small

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.549 
but when you're fishing these small
streams<00:06:32.639> don't<00:06:33.639> overlook<00:06:34.179> these<00:06:35.080> areas

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:35.559 
streams don't overlook these areas

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:50.309 
streams don't overlook these areas
because<00:06:35.740> there<00:06:36.279> are<00:06:36.429> fish<00:06:36.729> there

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.309 

here<00:06:51.319> is<00:06:51.439> the<00:06:51.530> last<00:06:51.710> one<00:06:51.919> of<00:06:52.759> this<00:06:52.909> video<00:06:53.319> and

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
here is the last one of this video and

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.510 
here is the last one of this video and
I'm<00:06:54.919> casting<00:06:56.229> up<00:06:57.229> alongside<00:06:57.650> of<00:06:57.949> that<00:06:58.189> rock

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
I'm casting up alongside of that rock

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.719 
I'm casting up alongside of that rock
that<00:06:58.550> you<00:06:58.879> see<00:06:59.300> I<00:07:00.189> can't<00:07:01.189> get<00:07:01.280> any<00:07:01.490> closer

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
that you see I can't get any closer

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.369 
that you see I can't get any closer
because<00:07:01.879> the<00:07:02.150> branches<00:07:02.569> in<00:07:02.659> that<00:07:02.780> large<00:07:03.050> tree

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:03.379 
because the branches in that large tree

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.899 
because the branches in that large tree
but<00:07:03.650> I'm<00:07:03.800> going<00:07:03.949> to<00:07:03.979> try<00:07:04.219> to<00:07:04.250> place<00:07:04.550> the<00:07:04.699> fly

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
but I'm going to try to place the fly

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.790 
but I'm going to try to place the fly
just<00:07:05.210> upstream<00:07:05.659> from<00:07:05.900> there<00:07:06.139> and<00:07:06.439> then<00:07:06.590> pick
