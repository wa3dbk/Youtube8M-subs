00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
especially the way it looks in this game

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.179 
especially the way it looks in this game
it's<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.759> vibrant<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.979> cool

it's so vibrant and really really cool

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880

but<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.150> Escrima<00:01:27.570> sticks<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:27.990> still<00:01:28.200> blue<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
but the Escrima sticks are still blue so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.499 
but the Escrima sticks are still blue so
that<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> throws<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.360> bit

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that kind of throws it off a little bit

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.359 
that kind of throws it off a little bit
if<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.110> made<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> Escrima<00:01:31.770> sticks<00:01:32.009> red<00:01:32.220> as

if they made the Escrima sticks red as

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
if they made the Escrima sticks red as
well<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.420> have<00:01:33.509> been<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.840> cool

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
well that would have been really cool

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
well that would have been really cool
but<00:01:34.439> unfortunately<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.310> didn't<00:01:35.640> but

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
