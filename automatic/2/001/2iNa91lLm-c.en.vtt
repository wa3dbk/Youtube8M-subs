all right a big day for me today finally
got<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.659> formal<00:00:04.110> hybrid<00:00:04.740> engine<00:00:05.009> home<00:00:05.190> and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
got my formal hybrid engine home and

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.789 
got my formal hybrid engine home and
we're<00:00:06.029> gonna<00:00:06.120> get<00:00:06.330> ready<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.660> start<00:00:07.560> putting

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
we're gonna get ready to start putting

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.310 
we're gonna get ready to start putting
it<00:00:07.950> back<00:00:08.069> together<00:00:08.719> the<00:00:09.719> reason<00:00:09.870> why<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.080> call

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
it back together the reason why I call

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.660 
it back together the reason why I call
this<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.559> hybrid<00:00:10.920> engine<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.519> there's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
this a hybrid engine is because there's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.370 
this a hybrid engine is because there's
three<00:00:11.880> different<00:00:12.000> tractors<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.990> made<00:00:13.230> up

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
three different tractors that made up

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.160 
three different tractors that made up
this<00:00:13.559> engine<00:00:13.849> a<00:00:14.849> lot<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> may<00:00:15.960> know<00:00:16.139> that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this engine a lot of you may know that

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.070 
this engine a lot of you may know that
if<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.529> don't<00:00:16.650> put<00:00:17.480> antifreeze<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.750> these

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
if you don't put antifreeze in these

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080 
if you don't put antifreeze in these
blocks<00:00:19.350> instead<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.520> busting<00:00:21.000> out

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
blocks instead of it just busting out

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.019 
blocks instead of it just busting out
the<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.080> freeze<00:00:22.320> plugs<00:00:22.760> it'll<00:00:23.760> crack

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the the the the freeze plugs it'll crack

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.320 
the the the the freeze plugs it'll crack
your<00:00:24.210> block<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.890> probably<00:00:26.880> happened<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
your block so that probably happened to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
your block so that probably happened to
my<00:00:27.449> original<00:00:27.720> super<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> block<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> had<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
my original super a block so I had to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.519 
my original super a block so I had to
find<00:00:29.460> another<00:00:29.789> block<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.050> block<00:00:31.109> came

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
find another block and this block came

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.610 
find another block and this block came
out<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.890> 130<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:32.969> flawless

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
out of a 130 and it is flawless

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.310 
out of a 130 and it is flawless
that's<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.710> 130<00:00:35.160> block<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.540> super<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> head

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's a 130 block that's a super a head

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.060 
that's a 130 block that's a super a head
and<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> 140<00:00:38.910> crank<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> 140<00:00:39.899> cam<00:00:40.110> now<00:00:41.040> a

and as a 140 crank and a 140 cam now a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
and as a 140 crank and a 140 cam now a
lot<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> diehard<00:00:42.120> farm<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.140> guys<00:00:43.350> might<00:00:43.649> be

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
lot of you diehard farm on guys might be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.029 
lot of you diehard farm on guys might be
wondering<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> used<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> 140<00:00:45.450> crank<00:00:45.890> in<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
wondering how I used a 140 crank in a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
wondering how I used a 140 crank in a
130<00:00:47.760> block<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.450> they're<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:48.750> bit

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
130 block because they're a little bit

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
130 block because they're a little bit
different<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.920> what<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.370> did<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.059> cut<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
different and what we did is we cut the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130 
different and what we did is we cut the
threaded<00:00:52.230> part<00:00:52.410> off<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> 140<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.020> some<00:00:55.020> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
threaded part off of the 140 and some of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
threaded part off of the 140 and some of
you<00:00:55.260> might<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> was<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> bad<00:00:56.280> idea<00:00:56.309> but

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you might think that was a bad idea but

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
you might think that was a bad idea but
you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.059> what<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> parts<00:00:58.980> tractor<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you know what I had a parts tractor I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490 
you know what I had a parts tractor I
was<00:01:00.120> using<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.539> parts<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.230> having<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
was using these parts I was having a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.729 
was using these parts I was having a
hard<00:01:01.680> time<00:01:01.770> finding<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.850> worked<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
hard time finding them and it worked so

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
hard time finding them and it worked so
that's<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.860> 140<00:01:05.400> crank<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.850> cut<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> threaded

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that's a 140 crank we cut the threaded

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.609 
that's a 140 crank we cut the threaded
part<00:01:06.600> off<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.640> here's<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> original<00:01:09.619> pulley

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
part off and here's the original pulley

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
part off and here's the original pulley
and<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> super8<00:01:12.420> pulley<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.590> know

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and there's a super8 pulley I don't know

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
and there's a super8 pulley I don't know
how<00:01:13.830> well<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> could<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
how well you could see it but we put the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
how well you could see it but we put the
super<00:01:15.869> 8<00:01:15.990> pulley<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.799> were<00:01:16.890> able<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
super 8 pulley on there we were able to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
super 8 pulley on there we were able to
press<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.759> crank<00:01:18.090> after<00:01:18.450> cutting<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
press it on the crank after cutting that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
press it on the crank after cutting that
threaded<00:01:19.110> part<00:01:19.290> off<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.150> worked<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.330> real

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
threaded part off and worked out real

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
threaded part off and worked out real
good<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.170> believe<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.850> timing<00:01:23.850> cover

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
good also I believe this timing cover

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
good also I believe this timing cover
came<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> 140<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> liked<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
came off the 140 I liked a little the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690 
came off the 140 I liked a little the
pointer<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.710> anyway<00:01:28.710> everything<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pointer on it anyway everything in the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640 
pointer on it anyway everything in the
engine<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> brand<00:01:30.420> new<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.470> been
