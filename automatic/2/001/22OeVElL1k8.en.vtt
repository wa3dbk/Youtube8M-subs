00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 with friends and now let's go to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 to myth number one, it was sent for xlc 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 jay and says the following what if 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.380
 draven ultanet and teleports to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 a place through which his axes will pass 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 to do this i need to move on 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.420
 maximum distance to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.300
 cram your axes before 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 teleportation as you see i flashed 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.370
 through the wall to the enemy base and set 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.590
 ward right near the fountain then I'll be back 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.989
 to the base and having appeared there I am ulta 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.930
 teleport quart is the first 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.219
 script where I just throw ult 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.450
 teleporting and just standing 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.000
 see what happens 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.250
 will axes pass through or driven them 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 catch after launching ults and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.370
 teleportation we see that ulta passes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
 through draven 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 and already on the way back for a while come back 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.879
 In the hands of the owner but there is another scenario 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.880
 which I wanted to try 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.100
 In this case, I want to know what will happen. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 If you press the Ufa button until 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 how will it fly to driven as soon as i 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.330
 I teleport and press the button ulti axes 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 being still on the road slowing down the beat 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.640
 seconds and already being near the host 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.280
 come back to him go on remus 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.229
 asks what will be there to quit 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 lucine singularity suite or similar 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.079
 skill and without exploding it up some 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.340
 damage will be dealt for this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.350
 I decided to blow the dough 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 first level skill to see 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 damage size and then use it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 boost again 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.439
 and blow fall and compare damage as 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.380
 you see 65 damage was dealt 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.840
 on the first rank of skill now i will do 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.470
 all too but before the explosion raise the rank 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.560
 up to 2 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.770
 so I throw a singularity pumping it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.860
 and blow up and in this case the skill has dealt 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.750
 105 damage in total we get that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.820
 if before activating the skill of it 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 pre- raise francs then damage 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.470
 applied to the target will be equal to the second 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.960
 rank 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.660
 purely out of curiosity, I decided to check 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.820
 same theory bendin conditions 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.770
 absolutely the same light biden first 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.770
 level deals sixty eight units 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.210
 damage now if you use skill and 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.270
 raise his rank in flight 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.750
 then what damage will be done first 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.820
 rank or 2 here I throw a stun and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.460
 while she flies raise to second rank 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.980
 and she does damage first rank 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.380
 but to make sure the results are correct 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.170
 i used second rank skill and she 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.500
 dealt much more damage never 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.540
 you canâ€™t be completely sure next 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.970
 the moment tested was sent both given and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.470
 the essence of the myth 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.560
 will ulta nautilus follow the goal 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.600
 which teleports in this test 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.300
 there will be three different scenarios 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.240
 in the first one I use teleportation on 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.090
 very long distance in this test I 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.400
 I teleport a platoon onatob nautilus 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.970
 uses here before the very disappearance 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.500
 goals and ult as a result canceled 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.630
 the second scenario is to return 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.760
 to the base of any distant points on the map 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.310
 to make sure both teleports are 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.640
 work the same everything happened 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.959
 absolutely the same as in the first test 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.600
 nautilus runs him in a split second 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.570
 before teleporting and ulta canceled 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.489
 and the last scenario is that if i 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.220
 teleporting to a point close to 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.140
 initial position in this case when 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.590
 teleportation at close range 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.720
 ulta nautilus pursues the goal to the end 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.350
 If the target is not far then the ulta will work and 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.160
 vice versa 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.470
 and the last myth sent by Carl that 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.299
 if wai ultanet malfita and that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.660
 will try to get tired through it 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.790
 who will damage someone for this we 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.769
 put the champions against each other and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.530
 as soon as you take the acceleration of malfit 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.840
 ultuet and passes through it as seen 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.420
 of war, the malfit had amal pitt 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.820
 turn passed through white but he 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.610
 I could not move until castes buy not ultimates 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.410
 ended in the second test we decided 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.430
 check what will happen if silent 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.600
 jump call 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.150
 but to a point near the initial 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.730
 as we see wai throws malte then 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.160
 air but also takes damage back 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.060
 none of this can stop the mind 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.640
 Yours, although malta and caused her damage thanks 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.130
 for watching and see you next 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.410
 a week 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.490
 translated and voiced by the x delay command
