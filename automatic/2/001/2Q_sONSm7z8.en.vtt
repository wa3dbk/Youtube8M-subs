overlooked<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.579> first<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.210> old<00:02:03.390> drain<00:02:03.689> pan

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
didn't have enough clearance for me to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
didn't have enough clearance for me to
fit<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.240> they're<00:02:06.420> hitting<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> wrench<00:02:07.079> under

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
fit and they're hitting the wrench under

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.710 
fit and they're hitting the wrench under
at<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> same<00:02:07.680> time<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.270> grabbed<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.360> second

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
at the same time so I grabbed a second

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
pan and then switch them after I got it
started<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.690> probably<00:02:12.959> wouldn't<00:02:13.260> hold

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
started because I probably wouldn't hold

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.760 
out of here to try and keep it off my
pipe<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.160> foot<00:03:29.310> peg<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.320> under<00:03:31.590> some

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
pipe and the foot peg this is under some

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.260 
pipe and the foot peg this is under some
spring<00:03:32.040> tension<00:03:32.490> so<00:03:32.670> once<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:32.970> get<00:03:33.060> more<00:03:33.210> than

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
spring tension so once you get more than

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.880 
spring tension so once you get more than
one<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.540> those<00:03:33.600> bolts<00:03:33.930> out<00:03:34.080> this<00:03:34.350> will<00:03:34.590> kind<00:03:34.830> of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
one of those bolts out this will kind of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.860 
one of those bolts out this will kind of
pull<00:03:35.340> itself<00:03:35.640> away<00:03:35.790> from<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.240> thing<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.810> to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
pull itself away from the thing just to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.110 
pull itself away from the thing just to
let<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:38.430> cover<00:03:38.700> will<00:03:38.910> come

straight off
there's<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.980> spring<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.460> was<00:03:41.550> talking<00:03:41.910> about

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
there's the spring I was talking about

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.690 
there's the spring I was talking about
there's<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.190> old<00:03:44.340> oil<00:03:44.580> filter<00:03:46.520> it'll<00:03:47.520> come

goes over that little hole and the
spring<00:04:06.450> will<00:04:06.480> fit<00:04:06.840> right<00:04:06.870> into<00:04:07.200> there<00:04:07.410> when

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
spring will fit right into there when

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.070 
spring will fit right into there when
that<00:04:07.680> cover<00:04:07.920> goes<00:04:08.160> back<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.870> I'm<00:04:09.870> going<00:04:10.020> to
