00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.639
 hi everyone in the 68 white toothbrushes 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.429
 we are here today with a new video 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 dedicated to those who go to make choices t do not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 it is a classic review however it is not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 not even an episode of the history of kate 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 last team but it is the announcement of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.390
 this new series that I will bring on 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 of Spaziogames channel is a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.859
 series of matches to bet the idea is me 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 Coming watching videos of youtuber 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 English they do this evening when 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 trying to reach a figure of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 millions of credits starting with only 10 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 thousand credits must succeed in winning 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.700
 these credits with average bet or 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.559
 against users or against other youtube 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.910
 and seeing that in Italy this thing does not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 had never been made I decided to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.989
 involve some Italian youtubers 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.539
 that I knew and others I knew 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.489
 recently I tell you the names of the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.739
 participants that this series are the former 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.730
 play friends fifa the former play fifa flash 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.530
 together fifa gamers 24 gringos orgasmic 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.930
 jas revenge fifa idk julius 9 and the con 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 so undo so many youtuber for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.409
 make an Italian event because the first one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720
 time that many Italian youtubers from 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 fifa get together to do this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 beautiful event a series everyone 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.450
 together a way to unite the community 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 Italian first because I see that it is not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 easy to make videos among the greens does maybe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.479
 on call of duty they are slightly more 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.390
 forward I see that there are more common ones united 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.009
 dedicated to call of duty with little fear 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.329
 stuff you don't make at youtuber 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.310
 lots of videos that this can 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.170
 be the beginning of collaborations 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.420
 collaboration collaborations we said 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 but of this series we have made some 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 small changes in fact there will not be a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 limit to our teams then 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.240
 we can use teams of both a million 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 of credits both from 5000 credits we see 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 I already have in mind to use one 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 team and tina of 50 60 my credits 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
 because I don't have high figures 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.369
 the other change is that we won't get to 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 a million credits but on the 500 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.149
 thousand because this is because it is the first a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 season we do in this series 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.619
 so we have not yet spread the word 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.550
 so it's hard to find people in 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.190
 italy that is ready to bet 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.620
 maybe 3 400 thousand credits at a time 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.150
 so we decided to stop at 500 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.580
 thousand credits a series that could 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.100
 however, last about a month and a half 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.830
 two then a series that will go on 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.290
 a lot because it involves you users 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 this series simply because you will have 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.950
 the ability to play against the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.440
 youtuber against the tuber you follow e 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.120
 not just on xbox one like in my case 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.820
 for example many of you in the comments 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.250
 I saw that they wrote because you don't 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.380
 pink slip also on playstation 4 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.060
 well simply because I only have xbox 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.890
 one with this series instead you can 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.710
 play against youtubers who have more and 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.240
 station 3 playstation 4 and xbox 360 e 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.790
 xbox one so you can play 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.460
 definitely a few more games 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.320
 could you give me a hand because if you 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.090
 you have playstation 4 for example you want 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.340
 help me win this series 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.530
 you can go and challenge a youtube that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
 participate in this series and play on 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.700
 playstation 4 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.870
 maybe bet 10,000 credits on you 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.120
 you are going to bet this yours 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.010
 youtube if you win the youtuber will have to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.720
 give of 10,000 believe and then lower 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.430
 its total quota will be more 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.459
 chance for my victory in 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.530
 future in description I leave you all 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.060

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.920
 I also recommend signing up with them 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.390
 so you can see their games 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.730
 see a little with the young man discover 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.160
