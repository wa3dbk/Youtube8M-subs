custom-made Schumaker transformers which

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.070 
custom-made Schumaker transformers which
were<00:02:27.670> what<00:02:27.880> they<00:02:28.030> had<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> old<00:02:28.600> ones<00:02:28.930> in

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
were what they had in the old ones in

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.000 
were what they had in the old ones in
the<00:02:29.440> 60s<00:02:29.940> I've<00:02:30.940> had<00:02:31.299> this<00:02:32.290> same<00:02:32.590> amplifier

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the 60s I've had this same amplifier

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.820 
the 60s I've had this same amplifier
actually<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.320> when<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.380> was<00:02:35.500> playing<00:02:35.739> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
actually and when I was playing the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.080 
actually and when I was playing the
amplifier<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.820> like<00:02:36.970> I'm

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
amplifier it's like it's like I'm

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.289 
amplifier it's like it's like I'm
playing<00:02:37.269> through<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.570> real<00:02:37.720> thing<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.640> have

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
playing through the real thing so I have

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.460 
playing through the real thing so I have
nothing<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:40.690> good<00:02:40.870> things<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.170> say<00:02:41.200> about

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
nothing but good things to say about

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.280 
nothing but good things to say about
this<00:02:41.620> amplifier<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.610> very<00:02:43.030> affordable<00:02:43.299> so<00:02:43.720> I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
this amplifier it's very affordable so I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.170 
this amplifier it's very affordable so I
go<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> n<00:02:44.860> stuff<00:02:45.070> music<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.610> pick<00:02:45.760> yourself<00:02:46.090> up

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
go to n stuff music and pick yourself up

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.470 
go to n stuff music and pick yourself up
one<00:02:46.420> thanks<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.930> lot
