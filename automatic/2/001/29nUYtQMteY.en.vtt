00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi I'm Steve Miller let me show you how

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.720 
hi I'm Steve Miller let me show you how
to<00:00:02.790> attach<00:00:03.030> strobes<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> iCloud<00:00:04.980> DSLR

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
to attach strobes on to the iCloud DSLR

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.660 
to attach strobes on to the iCloud DSLR
system<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:10.080> part<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.559> pretty<00:00:10.800> easy<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
system this part is pretty easy the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
system this part is pretty easy the
first<00:00:12.090> thing<00:00:12.269> we're<00:00:12.450> gonna<00:00:12.599> do<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:12.929> locate<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
first thing we're gonna do is locate the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.240 
first thing we're gonna do is locate the
bulk<00:00:13.889> head<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.059> back<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> housing

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
bulk head on the back of the housing

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
bulk head on the back of the housing
there'll<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> waterproof<00:00:17.940> cap<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.869> for

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
there'll be a waterproof cap on here for

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
there'll be a waterproof cap on here for
diving<00:00:20.189> without<00:00:20.730> light<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.750> remove

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
diving without light so you can remove

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.950 
diving without light so you can remove
this<00:00:22.439> cap<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.760> find<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.240> cord<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.779> your

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this cap and then find your cord in your

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
this cap and then find your cord in your
stroke<00:00:25.289> now<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:25.980> case<00:00:26.279> we're<00:00:27.000> using<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
stroke now in this case we're using a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.470 
stroke now in this case we're using a
dual<00:00:27.750> TTL<00:00:28.500> cable<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.699> run<00:00:29.880> two

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
dual TTL cable so that we can run two

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.959 
dual TTL cable so that we can run two
separate<00:00:31.019> strokes<00:00:31.640> simultaneously<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.820> have

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
separate strokes simultaneously and have

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
separate strokes simultaneously and have
them<00:00:33.149> both<00:00:33.300> controlled<00:00:33.840> by<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> camera<00:00:34.620> keep

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
them both controlled by the camera keep

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
them both controlled by the camera keep
in<00:00:35.370> mind<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.910> only<00:00:36.120> happen<00:00:36.420> once

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
in mind this will only happen once

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.380 
in mind this will only happen once
you've<00:00:37.050> hooked<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> hotshoe<00:00:38.160> cord<00:00:38.879> inside

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you've hooked up the hotshoe cord inside

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
you've hooked up the hotshoe cord inside
of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> camera<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.379> your<00:00:40.500> camera's<00:00:40.920> hachi

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
of the camera to your camera's hachi

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.010 
of the camera to your camera's hachi
that's<00:00:41.640> how<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> communicate

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that's how it's going to communicate

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.340 
that's how it's going to communicate
with<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.860> strobes<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> let's<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:45.899> go

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
with your strobes so let's first go

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.700 
with your strobes so let's first go
ahead<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.300> hook<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> cables<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.500> then

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
ahead and hook up the cables and then

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
ahead and hook up the cables and then
we'll<00:00:49.920> hook<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.100> our<00:00:50.489> arms<00:00:50.870> when<00:00:51.870> your<00:00:52.020> cables

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
we'll hook up our arms when your cables

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
we'll hook up our arms when your cables
are<00:00:52.620> set<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> during<00:00:53.760> storage<00:00:54.390> you'll

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
are set to you and during storage you'll

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.369 
are set to you and during storage you'll
find<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.360> threads<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> pins

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
find that the threads and the pins

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
find that the threads and the pins
inside<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.309> cables<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.090> protected<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
inside of these cables are protected and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.840 
inside of these cables are protected and
that's<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.440> pretty<00:01:01.620> obvious<00:01:01.710> reasons<00:01:02.280> these

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's for pretty obvious reasons these

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.539 
that's for pretty obvious reasons these
are<00:01:03.059> fragile<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.170> important<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
are fragile and very important and of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
are fragile and very important and of
course<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.090> our<00:01:06.119> ever-present<00:01:06.720> oring

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
course we have our ever-present oring

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.539 
course we have our ever-present oring
inside<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.250> each<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.760> cords<00:01:09.650> now<00:01:10.650> one

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
inside of each of these cords now one

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.340 
inside of each of these cords now one
end<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> call<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> pigtail

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
end we like to call this a pigtail

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
end we like to call this a pigtail
sometimes<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.610> end<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> pigtail<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sometimes one end of the pigtail is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.580 
sometimes one end of the pigtail is
going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.549> camera's<00:01:18.299> body<00:01:18.840> into

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to go into the camera's body into

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
going to go into the camera's body into
our<00:01:19.710> bulkhead<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:21.030> obviously<00:01:21.240> each<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
our bulkhead and then obviously each of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
our bulkhead and then obviously each of
these<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.770> abs<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.490> go<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> my

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
these two abs are going to go to my

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.320 
these two abs are going to go to my
right<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.990> left<00:01:25.020> stroke<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> first<00:01:27.119> we'll

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
right and my left stroke so first we'll

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
right and my left stroke so first we'll
hook<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> bulkhead<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
hook up the bulkhead to the back of the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
hook up the bulkhead to the back of the
camera<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.579> gonna<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.970> two<00:01:30.299> pins<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
camera you're gonna see two pins and a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.210 
camera you're gonna see two pins and a
two<00:01:32.610> adjacent<00:01:33.240> holes<00:01:33.570> inside<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> bulkhead

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
two adjacent holes inside the bulkhead

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.700 
two adjacent holes inside the bulkhead
that<00:01:35.850> will<00:01:36.060> match<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.470> goes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that will match up when this goes

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
that will match up when this goes
together<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.369> goes<00:01:38.549> together<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.270> like

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
together it goes together very much like

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.719 
together it goes together very much like
a<00:01:39.810> plug<00:01:40.229> you'll<00:01:40.560> feel<00:01:40.770> them<00:01:40.950> seat<00:01:41.340> into

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a plug you'll feel them seat into

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.179

already long been in contact with its
seeding<00:01:59.070> surface<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.790> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.450> crank<00:02:00.750> this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
seeding surface so if you crank this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.810 
seeding surface so if you crank this
down<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.619> hard<00:02:01.740> even<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.640> your

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
down really hard even just with your

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
down really hard even just with your
hand<00:02:03.200> sometimes<00:02:04.200> it'll<00:02:04.439> freeze<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> be

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
hand sometimes it'll freeze and be

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
hand sometimes it'll freeze and be
difficult<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.030> undo<00:02:06.450> when<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> little

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
difficult to undo when you get a little

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
difficult to undo when you get a little
bit<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.469> saltwater<00:02:07.860> corrosion<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
bit of saltwater corrosion going on I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.780 
bit of saltwater corrosion going on I
try<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> go<00:02:09.899> till<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.560> snug<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.370> then

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
try to go till it's just snug and then

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.430 
try to go till it's just snug and then
feel<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.360> where<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.660> wants<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:12.989> stop

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
feel that where it wants to stop

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.160 
feel that where it wants to stop
stop<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.430> definitely<00:02:15.000> never<00:02:15.480> use<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> wrench

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
stop there definitely never use a wrench

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.310 
stop there definitely never use a wrench
on<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.770> section<00:02:17.690> from<00:02:18.690> there<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> other<00:02:19.230> two

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
on this section from there the other two

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.500 
on this section from there the other two
ends<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> pigtail<00:02:20.610> are<00:02:20.970> going<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
ends of the pigtail are going to go to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
ends of the pigtail are going to go to
your<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.170> left<00:02:22.320> stroke<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.340> we'll<00:02:23.490> go

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
your right and left stroke so we'll go

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.520 
your right and left stroke so we'll go
ahead<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.940> hook<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:24.960> exactly

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
ahead and hook these up and it's exactly

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
ahead and hook these up and it's exactly
the<00:02:25.800> same<00:02:26.780> assembly<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:29.010> same<00:02:29.540> pin<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the same assembly and the same pin and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.190 
the same assembly and the same pin and
socket<00:02:32.360> configuration<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.750> something

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
socket configuration this is something

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.980 
socket configuration this is something
that<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.530> always<00:02:37.770> done<00:02:38.160> very<00:02:38.810> slowly<00:02:39.810> very

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
that is always done very slowly very

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.010 
that is always done very slowly very
carefully<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> only<00:02:41.580> hand<00:02:42.300> tight<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.600> would

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
carefully and only hand tight you would

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.530 
carefully and only hand tight you would
inspect<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.740> o-rings<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:45.090> same<00:02:45.330> way

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
inspect these o-rings in the same way

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720 
inspect these o-rings in the same way
that<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:45.990> inspect<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.920> body<00:02:47.190> o<00:02:47.340> rings

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that you would inspect the body o rings

00:02:47.730 --> 00:03:02.920 
that you would inspect the body o rings
on<00:02:48.270> these<00:02:48.630> DSLR<00:02:49.290> system<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.920> reports<00:02:50.310> itself

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.950 

now<00:03:03.930> my<00:03:04.290> system<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.190> corded<00:03:05.850> which<00:03:06.270> means<00:03:06.660> I've

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
now my system is corded which means I've

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.050 
now my system is corded which means I've
protected<00:03:07.620> all<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> holes<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.610> system

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
protected all of the holes so the system

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060 
protected all of the holes so the system
is<00:03:09.180> basically<00:03:09.690> waterproof<00:03:10.320> at<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.650> point<00:03:10.980> I

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
is basically waterproof at this point I

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.580 
is basically waterproof at this point I
can<00:03:11.250> take<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.610> into<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> water<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.320> last

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
can take it into the water then the last

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.430 
can take it into the water then the last
step<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.190> going<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> actually<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.170> mount

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
step is going to actually be to mount

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.410 
step is going to actually be to mount
the<00:03:16.980> strobes<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:19.050> their<00:03:19.560> base<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:21.360> is

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the strobes on to their base this is

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.199 
the strobes on to their base this is
done<00:03:21.750> with<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> quick<00:03:22.260> release<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:23.580> seats<00:03:23.970> in

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
done with a quick release it seats in

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.810 
done with a quick release it seats in
with<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.540> silver<00:03:24.959> button<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.530> back<00:03:25.820> locks

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
with the silver button on the back locks

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.090 
with the silver button on the back locks
it<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.150> place<00:03:27.180> very<00:03:27.690> strong<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.680> pull<00:03:29.010> off

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
it in place very strong so you pull off

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.780 
it in place very strong so you pull off
little<00:03:29.459> protectors<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.470> traveling<00:03:31.790> depress

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
little protectors for traveling depress

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.910 
little protectors for traveling depress
the<00:03:33.270> quick<00:03:33.540> release<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.200> quick<00:03:34.410> release<00:03:34.590> is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
the quick release the quick release is

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.830 
the quick release the quick release is
there<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.250> case<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.580> want<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.880> handhold<00:03:36.480> your

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
there in case you want to handhold your

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.199 
there in case you want to handhold your
strobe<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.440> middle<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.860> dive<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:39.030> these

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
strobe in the middle of a dive but these

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.960 
strobe in the middle of a dive but these
are<00:03:39.390> designed<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.900> be<00:03:39.959> very<00:03:40.320> very<00:03:40.770> strong<00:03:41.580> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
are designed to be very very strong and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.040 
are designed to be very very strong and
support<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> weight<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.989> strobes<00:03:44.840> okay

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
ocean at that point this system is

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.020 
ocean at that point this system is
waterproof<00:04:03.800> everything<00:04:04.800> is<00:04:04.950> functional<00:04:05.790> I

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
waterproof everything is functional I

can turn things off and move around the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.470 
can turn things off and move around the
different<00:04:11.310> menus<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
different menus and I can do that

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.320 
different menus and I can do that
whether<00:04:12.720> I'm<00:04:12.989> dry<00:04:13.320> or<00:04:13.620> wet<00:04:13.680> at<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.370> point<00:04:14.730> so

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
whether I'm dry or wet at this point so
