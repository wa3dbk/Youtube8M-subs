00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.920
 we will go to a lonely island 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.590
 abandoned in the ocean on which some 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.600
 the magician built a beacon with time on 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.670
 Island sheep which appeared very 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.010
 liked green grass and they decided 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.870
 stay but nature has contributed its 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.220
 island adjustments became gradually 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.650
 dive under the water 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.930
 the sheep had to learn to hold onto 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.829
 afloat inside a small cardboard 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 the box are the rules of the game and three 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.480
 decks of cards that differ shirts 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.239
 this lifebuoys tide level and 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.510
 weather 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.890
 cards are easy to divide by shirt color 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.640
 red life buoys 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.809
 blue cards flooded and orange 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.579
 weather maps on 24 maps 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.559
 lifebuoys drawn 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.179
 lifebuoy which is peaceful 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.050
 swinging on the waves 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.800
 all 24 cards are identical level cards 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.490
 tide 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.950
 have through numbering from 1 to 12 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.110
 each card is presented in two 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.689
 instances why only in the game 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.930
 used 24 cards 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.409
 the more flooding and the higher the level 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.200
 tide the higher the numeric figure on 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.950
 weather maps have 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.799
 through numbering from 1 to 60 and broken 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.829
 in groups of 12 cards each group has 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.490
 its color on some maps are depicted 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.859
 either whole or half rescue 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.890
 laps and so need to moan thickened 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.570
 black clouds and the tide began gradually 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.399
 Sushi began to go under water 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.890
 sheep can not do without your help 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.039
 so grab lifebuoys and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.409

 one penalty point for each one left 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.870
 players have a lifeline 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.960
 they get one bonus point 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.630
 player having a minimum card 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.289
 flooding gets one extra 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.669
 point in our case, the left player gets 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:27.039
 3 reward points right one 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.710
 central one penalty point

 the number of rounds in the game is equal to the number 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.860
 players in our example, the game will continue 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.110
 three rounds after each round of the card 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.810
 tide levels are mixed into a single 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.669
 pile and laid out in the center of the table 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.740
 each player takes a set of reset cards 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.310
 weather conditions as well as rescue 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.930
 circles and passes the kit to your opponent 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:59.050
 on the left this way all the players for 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.270
 games will be played with each set of cards one 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.729
 time after the last round 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.599

 the final result reveals the winner 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.169
 board game keep afloat 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.419
 develops memory and forces players 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.310
 think your moves ahead it 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.440
 kind of bidding in which you 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.690
 invest your capital in the minimum 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.699
 tide chart values while 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.480
 try to keep your stock in the form of 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.270
 rescue 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.760
 laps during the game opponent constantly 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.220
 exchange cards starting with the second 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.930
 players already know exactly which round 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.680
 a set of weather maps is located at 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.900
 adversary 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.390
 all this contributes to bluffing risk 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.730
 wrong decision can reward 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.620
 you tide power of 12 points and you 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.050
 lose a couple of rescue 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.180
 laps while i'm telling you about the game 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.370
 acutely gradually submerged 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.900
 so grab the rescue others and 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.300
 quicker to help and unhappy 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.230
 making who living near the sea so 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.230
 and did not learn to swim
