this DVD so just go over a couple of
things<00:02:18.190> what<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.430> go<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> learn<00:02:18.790> today<00:02:19.030> basic

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
things what we go to learn today basic

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.380 
things what we go to learn today basic
strobing<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.520> very<00:02:21.880> important<00:02:22.330> for

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
strobing so it's with very important for

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.900 
strobing so it's with very important for
animation<00:02:22.990> hitting<00:02:23.740> move<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:23.920> move<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> hips

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
animation hitting move and move and hips

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.600 
animation hitting move and move and hips
technique<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:26.290> sounds<00:02:26.709> kind<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.070> same<00:02:27.310> but

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
technique it sounds kind of the same but

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.190 
technique it sounds kind of the same but
once<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.420> into<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.840> you're<00:02:28.989> going<00:02:29.140> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
once we get into it you're going to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.430 
once we get into it you're going to
understand<00:02:29.590> why<00:02:30.150> basic<00:02:31.150> ticking<00:02:31.510> time

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
understand why basic ticking time

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.760 
understand why basic ticking time
stopping<00:02:32.860> speed<00:02:33.760> control<00:02:34.270> which<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.560> to

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
stopping speed control which is when to

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.280 
stopping speed control which is when to
do<00:02:35.920> slow-motion<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.270> stop<00:02:37.510> when<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.110> time

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
do slow-motion when to stop when to time

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.160 
do slow-motion when to stop when to time
stop<00:02:38.620> when<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.310> show<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.270> stuff<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
stop when to show so stuff like that and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.290 
stop when to show so stuff like that and
then<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> end<00:02:42.280> we're<00:02:42.640> gonna<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.030> some

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
