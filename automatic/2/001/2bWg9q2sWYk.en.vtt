going to be meeting up with the one the
only<00:01:55.850> data<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.780> Kyle<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
only data would that is right Kyle and I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
only data would that is right Kyle and I
are<00:01:58.409> gonna<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.649> seeing<00:01:58.890> each<00:01:58.979> other<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.219> while

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
are gonna be seeing each other and while

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.499 
are gonna be seeing each other and while
we're<00:01:59.490> down<00:01:59.579> there<00:01:59.640> cuz<00:01:59.909> he<00:02:00.030> lives<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.360> Florida

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we're down there cuz he lives in Florida

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359 
we're down there cuz he lives in Florida
actually<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.009> we're<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually so I think we're going to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.469 
actually so I think we're going to
Universal<00:02:02.759> together<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> don't<00:02:03.180> know<00:02:03.299> what

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
Universal together I don't know what

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.490 
Universal together I don't know what
else<00:02:03.600> were<00:02:03.659> gonna<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.960> down<00:02:04.140> there

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
else were gonna do down there

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
else were gonna do down there
I<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.070> sounds<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.340> school<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.240> now

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I think it sounds like school right now

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.660 
I think it sounds like school right now
so<00:02:06.439> probably<00:02:07.439> only<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.489> day

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so probably only gonna do like one day

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.839 
so probably only gonna do like one day
of<00:02:08.910> Universal<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.709> maybe<00:02:10.920> maybe<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of Universal and then like maybe maybe a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
of Universal and then like maybe maybe a
couple<00:02:12.090> days<00:02:12.239> we're<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.810> met<00:02:12.989> his

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
couple days we're like I met his

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.810

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
two waves a day I want to get an SMP

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.070 
two waves a day I want to get an SMP
going<00:05:53.310> back<00:05:53.460> again<00:05:53.610> I'm<00:05:53.910> in<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.479> process<00:05:54.810> of

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
going back again I'm in the process of

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.409 
going back again I'm in the process of
trying<00:05:55.289> to<00:05:55.320> get<00:05:55.410> into<00:05:55.620> one<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:56.400> don't<00:05:57.030> know<00:05:57.270> if

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
trying to get into one I don't know if

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.240 
trying to get into one I don't know if
that<00:05:57.599> will<00:05:57.810> work<00:05:57.840> out<00:05:58.110> I'm<00:05:58.320> hoping<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:59.070> will

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
that will work out I'm hoping it will

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.550 
that will work out I'm hoping it will
because<00:05:59.910> it'll<00:06:00.060> help<00:06:00.180> me<00:06:00.270> get<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.720> if<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.199> can<00:06:01.380> get

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
because it'll help me get a if I can get

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.830 
because it'll help me get a if I can get
that<00:06:01.680> SP<00:06:02.130> going<00:06:02.460> then<00:06:03.000> two<00:06:03.539> minutes<00:06:03.630> today

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
that SP going then two minutes today

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.420 
that SP going then two minutes today
will<00:06:03.990> be<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.080> lot<00:06:04.229> more<00:06:04.349> likely<00:06:04.650> if<00:06:04.949> not<00:06:05.190> then

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
will be a lot more likely if not then

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.050 
will be a lot more likely if not then
it's<00:06:06.240> a<00:06:06.330> little<00:06:06.570> less<00:06:06.720> likely<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:08.060> hopefully

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
it's a little less likely so hopefully

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.589 
it's a little less likely so hopefully
that'll<00:06:09.210> work<00:06:09.330> out<00:06:09.479> it<00:06:09.660> should<00:06:11.030> you<00:06:12.030> know<00:06:12.060> so<00:06:12.389> I

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
that'll work out it should you know so I

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.779 
that'll work out it should you know so I
think<00:06:13.410> I<00:06:13.560> think<00:06:13.740> that's<00:06:14.010> all<00:06:14.160> I<00:06:14.280> have<00:06:14.490> to<00:06:14.610> say<00:06:14.639> I

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
think I think that's all I have to say I

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:15.890 
think I think that's all I have to say I
didn't<00:06:15.030> only<00:06:15.120> plan<00:06:15.300> the<00:06:15.389> stuff<00:06:15.510> beforehand

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
didn't only plan the stuff beforehand

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.670 
didn't only plan the stuff beforehand
because<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:16.110> was<00:06:16.229> kind<00:06:16.560> of<00:06:16.590> a

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
because I was kind of a

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.110 
because I was kind of a
spur-of-the-moment<00:06:17.010> type<00:06:17.520> of<00:06:17.669> thing<00:06:17.820> because

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
spur-of-the-moment type of thing because

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.460 
spur-of-the-moment type of thing because
I<00:06:18.270> feel<00:06:18.389> like<00:06:18.510> I<00:06:18.570> should<00:06:18.720> you<00:06:18.990> know<00:06:19.080> update<00:06:19.380> you
