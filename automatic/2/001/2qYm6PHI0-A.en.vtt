00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.839
 welcome to this other is where you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.429
 I present this maran cd player 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.009
 we are on the model a 42 mk2 cd 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.800
 really in front of a CD player more 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.230
 unique that rare of its kind has one 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.930
 quality of the most absurd Neapolitan air 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 which I have very rarely heard in 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.359
 were two CD models that I have 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 you happen to name the cd player lives that i 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 have come is equipped with the del pil of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.380
 fixing convention digital optical output 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.040
 on the back and ultra of the last reader of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.420
 cd and believe me i am not really 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 Spectacular unfortunately I did not see you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.719
 to account because they are always more 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.340
 being from the video camera is one thing 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.680
 I always repeat that I write even the least 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.930
 ads 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.470
 unfortunately the only defect that suffers 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.540
 this cd player is the lack of 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.020
 the functionality of the cart or better 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.400
 surely inside it will be a spring or 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.989
 something else he ca n't 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.300
 the trolley works well 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.910
 I like never arrived like them 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.950
 too much lawn so that I propose it does not have 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.280
 had a way of really splitting nothing 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.600
 But we have no problems because really 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.869
 how well this reader works 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.040
 it's really a pity and stop 90 up 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.049
 travels in the genre but promised 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.490
 simply a rubber band but if I can 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.049
 also another way or see 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.930
 inside what is the problem 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.869
 I repeat at 90 percent it should be 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.860
 the internal spring that wears out like 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.380
 you see classic quietly together 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.850
 cd reads all the cycles also with 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.310
 remastered and equipped with the trolley 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.280
 amortized to a perspective really 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.320
 amazing marans inside 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.119
 propinano we light up a bit e 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.560
 let's see what you heard the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.320
 trolley noise that only tests a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.420
 take everything already given to the incomes 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.200
 see it's been about half a second since 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.649
 first put cd we activate the display 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 very nice among other things as you see 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.830
 party did not tell us anything because 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.239
 I'm made a speaker really doesn't 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.640
 also do friday with shame 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.950
 and trees 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.050
 but the small and frankly for this 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.910
 kind of jobs is fine I owe myself 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.430
 just demonstrate the operation for 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.670
 the audio really guarantees that if the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.670
 what's this 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 as you can see, we go forward many arms 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.160
 drama as you see very fast now 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.140
 you software or directly to the order 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.140
 trace with cells how long it takes 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 in the city 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:16.990
 the second in evil 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:21.420
 we know in false now we leave from 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.420
 first we see its gloss as first 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:34.209
 10 really and tightly seen the ugly is 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.760
 this marx cd 42 mk2 di 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.140
 this very important symbol because it 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.140
 differentiates from the normal model 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:51.330
 let's go marine and spend good health
