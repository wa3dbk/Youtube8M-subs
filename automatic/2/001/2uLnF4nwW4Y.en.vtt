as<00:00:00.120> I<00:00:00.240> say<00:00:00.390> I'm<00:00:00.480> not<00:00:00.510> an<00:00:00.690> economist<00:00:01.140> really<00:00:01.319> I'm

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
as I say I'm not an economist really I'm

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.690 
as I say I'm not an economist really I'm
a<00:00:01.469> credit<00:00:01.740> analyst<00:00:02.040> but<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.159> thought<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.429> lot

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
a credit analyst but I thought a lot

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.190 
a credit analyst but I thought a lot
about<00:00:03.440> the<00:00:04.640> duration<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:06.359> odd<00:00:06.690> sort<00:00:07.049> of

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
about the duration of this odd sort of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290 
about the duration of this odd sort of
place<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.710> we're<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.069> right<00:00:08.220> now<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.639> I

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
place that we're in right now and I

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.270 
place that we're in right now and I
think<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.750> comes<00:00:09.990> down<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> fact<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
think it comes down to the fact that the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.570 
think it comes down to the fact that the
concept<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.360> fiat<00:00:13.080> money<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> concept<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
concept of fiat money and the concept of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300 
concept of fiat money and the concept of
social<00:00:14.940> intervention<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.830> very<00:00:17.039> sweet

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
social intervention is a very very sweet

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.660 
social intervention is a very very sweet
lie<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.090> think<00:00:18.960> people<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.369> believe

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
lie I think people would like to believe

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.900 
lie I think people would like to believe
that<00:00:21.140> they<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.199> consume<00:00:22.859> beyond<00:00:23.580> their

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
that they can consume beyond their

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.189 
that they can consume beyond their
ability<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> generate<00:00:24.600> utility<00:00:25.050> as

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ability to generate utility as

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.349 
ability to generate utility as
individuals<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:26.340> corporations<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.330> a

individuals as corporations and as a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
individuals as corporations and as a
country<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.320> nice<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.890> believe<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
country it's nice to believe that the

country it's nice to believe that the
big<00:00:29.760> thinkers<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> world

it's nice to believe I think that we had

it's nice to believe I think that we had
a<00:00:41.730> problem<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.480> 2008<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> mistake<00:00:44.370> of

a problem in 2008 that was a mistake of
liquidity<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.809> caused<00:00:46.170> by<00:00:46.500> some

toxic mortgage or something like that
somewhere<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.370> pin<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> went<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
somewhere there was a pin that went in a

somewhere there was a pin that went in a

it<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.210> made<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.660> better<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.020> us

it and they made it all better for us
and<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.219> didn't<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> worry<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.329> things

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and we didn't have to worry about things

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
and we didn't have to worry about things
like<00:00:58.399> working<00:00:59.399> or<00:01:00.059> saving<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.260> creating<00:01:01.670> or

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
like working or saving or creating or

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.899 
like working or saving or creating or
producing<00:01:03.229> all<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.860> had<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
producing all we had to do was be

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
producing all we had to do was be
consumers<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.720> were<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> consumer<00:01:07.350> let<00:01:07.500> economy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
consumers we were a consumer let economy

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.130 
consumers we were a consumer let economy
and<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.820> spent<00:01:09.150> nevermind<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:09.960> didn't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and if we just spent nevermind we didn't

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
and if we just spent nevermind we didn't
have<00:01:10.229> any<00:01:10.350> money<00:01:10.439> things<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.520> okay<00:01:11.549> so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have any money things would be okay so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
have any money things would be okay so
the<00:01:12.750> reason<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.290> suspect<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the reason that I suspect that this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
the reason that I suspect that this
hiatus<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.610> gone<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.210> long<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
hiatus has gone on for so long is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.760 
hiatus has gone on for so long is
because<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.900> lie<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> attractive<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.439> think

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
because the lie is so attractive I think

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.840 
because the lie is so attractive I think
it<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.920> Ambrose<00:01:20.310> Bierce<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:21.810> pointed<00:01:22.140> out

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
it was Ambrose Bierce that pointed out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.890 
it was Ambrose Bierce that pointed out
that<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.860> root<00:01:25.860> word<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.479> confidence<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> con

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that the root word of confidence is con

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.520 
that the root word of confidence is con
and<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.530> attractive

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and it's a very very very attractive

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
and it's a very very very attractive
picture<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.390> spawned<00:01:33.990> this

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
picture that has I think spawned this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
picture that has I think spawned this
confidence<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.369> other<00:01:35.520> thing<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
confidence the other thing that you

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.010 
confidence the other thing that you
learn<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.600> time<00:01:37.220> as<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> stockbroker<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
learn over time as a stockbroker is that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.440 
learn over time as a stockbroker is that
markets<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.650> driven<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:41.430> people's<00:01:41.909> near-term

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

perspective people's expectation of the

future is driven by their experience in

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the immediate past has been a soporific

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.450 
the immediate past has been a soporific
in<00:01:51.600> fact<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> big<00:01:52.229> thinkers<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.890> managed<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
in fact the big thinkers have managed to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
in fact the big thinkers have managed to
cram<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.149> much<00:01:54.180> liquidity<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> system

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
cram so much liquidity into the system

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
cram so much liquidity into the system
that<00:01:56.520> they've<00:01:56.729> papered<00:01:57.149> over<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> cracks

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that they've papered over the cracks

that they've papered over the cracks
with<00:01:58.520> specious<00:01:59.719> currency<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
with specious currency and I think the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.399 
with specious currency and I think the
related<00:02:02.909> psychological<00:02:04.640> component<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.820> this

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
related psychological component of this

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.930 
related psychological component of this
is<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.520> most<00:02:07.969> people<00:02:08.149> are<00:02:08.989> not<00:02:09.920> as<00:02:10.310> free

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
is that most people are not as free

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.780 
is that most people are not as free
thinking<00:02:11.420> as<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:12.140> would<00:02:12.319> suspect<00:02:12.790> most

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
thinking as you would suspect most

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.160 
thinking as you would suspect most
people<00:02:13.940> rather<00:02:14.450> than<00:02:14.629> searching<00:02:14.989> for

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
people rather than searching for

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.740 
people rather than searching for
information<00:02:15.379> that's<00:02:15.950> objective<00:02:16.450> search<00:02:17.450> for

information that's objective search for

information that's objective search for
information<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.470> reinforces<00:02:19.280> comfortable

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
information that reinforces comfortable

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.089 
information that reinforces comfortable
paradigms<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.690> prejudices<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.560> it's

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
paradigms and prejudices and it's

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.710 
paradigms and prejudices and it's
certainly<00:02:22.400> much<00:02:22.580> more<00:02:22.760> pleasant<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.330> believe

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
certainly much more pleasant to believe

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.289 
certainly much more pleasant to believe

that mr. Boehner and mr. Obama and mr.

Bernanke can solve all our problems we
don't<00:02:29.599> then<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.340> responsibility<00:02:31.340> for

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
don't then have responsibility for

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
don't then have responsibility for
ourselves<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.090> much<00:02:32.450> better<00:02:32.629> to<00:02:32.780> think<00:02:33.049> that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
ourselves it's much better to think that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680 
ourselves it's much better to think that
you<00:02:33.290> could<00:02:33.440> vote<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:33.890> mr.<00:02:34.640> Obama<00:02:34.879> or<00:02:35.180> mr.<00:02:35.480> Bush

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
you could vote for mr. Obama or mr. Bush

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.630 
you could vote for mr. Obama or mr. Bush
or<00:02:35.900> some<00:02:36.049> other<00:02:36.230> thug<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.250> just<00:02:37.430> going

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
or some other thug and then just going

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.680 
or some other thug and then just going
about<00:02:37.730> your<00:02:37.879> life<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.330> not<00:02:38.390> have<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.599> be

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
about your life and not have to be

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.539 
about your life and not have to be
responsible<00:02:39.170> for<00:02:39.290> yourself<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:39.829> my<00:02:39.980> suspicion

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
responsible for yourself so my suspicion

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.569 
responsible for yourself so my suspicion
is<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.569> confluence<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:43.069> fact<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
is that the confluence of the fact that

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.280 
is that the confluence of the fact that
the<00:02:44.120> root<00:02:44.269> word<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> confidence<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.049> caught

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
the root word of confidence is caught

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.960 
the root word of confidence is caught
and<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.560> con<00:02:45.829> is<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.280> attractive<00:02:46.489> con

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and this con is a very attractive con

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.940 
and this con is a very attractive con
and<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.900> people's<00:02:48.260> perception<00:02:48.799> of<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and the people's perception of the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.350 
and the people's perception of the
future<00:02:49.069> is<00:02:49.340> shaped<00:02:49.519> by<00:02:49.610> their<00:02:49.790> immediate<00:02:50.120> past

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
future is shaped by their immediate past

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.960 
future is shaped by their immediate past
and<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:51.170> people<00:02:51.349> have<00:02:51.680> searched<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.610> facts

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
and that people have searched for facts

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.539 
and that people have searched for facts
in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> immediate<00:02:53.750> past<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.769> can<00:02:55.099> allow

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
in the immediate past that can allow

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.270 
in the immediate past that can allow
them<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.200> complacent<00:02:57.200> as<00:02:57.530> opposed<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> take

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
them to be complacent as opposed to take

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.119 
them to be complacent as opposed to take
action<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.200> reason<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.980> this

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
action is the reason that this

action is the reason that this

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
situations gone on for so long

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.220 
situations gone on for so long
caution<00:03:04.459> I'm<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.329> credit<00:03:05.599> analyst<00:03:05.900> I'm<00:03:05.989> not<00:03:06.140> an

caution I'm a credit analyst I'm not an

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.839 
caution I'm a credit analyst I'm not an
economist<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:06.709> I'm<00:03:06.829> making<00:03:07.099> up<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:07.609> I<00:03:07.640> just
