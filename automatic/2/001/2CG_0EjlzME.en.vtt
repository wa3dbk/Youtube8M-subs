00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270 

so<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:01.079> first<00:00:01.319> of<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.589> issues<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:02.100> want

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so the first of the issues that we want

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400 
so the first of the issues that we want
to<00:00:02.340> look<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.909> whether<00:00:03.149> or<00:00:03.419> not<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.020> neck<00:00:04.200> is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
to look at is whether or not the neck is

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.299 
to look at is whether or not the neck is
warping<00:00:04.920> or<00:00:05.160> bowing<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.330> any<00:00:06.540> way<00:00:07.250> and<00:00:08.250> so

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
warping or bowing in any way and so

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.740 
warping or bowing in any way and so
we'll<00:00:08.880> use<00:00:09.090> our<00:00:09.620> steel<00:00:10.620> rule<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.460> lay<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.599> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
we'll use our steel rule and lay it on

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230 
we'll use our steel rule and lay it on
the<00:00:12.870> frets<00:00:13.679> themselves<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.700> between<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the frets themselves in between the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.680 
the frets themselves in between the
strings<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.379> case<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.850> while<00:00:18.330> it's

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
strings in this case and while it's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.660 
strings in this case and while it's
laying<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.250> edge<00:00:20.539> we<00:00:21.539> will<00:00:21.720> look

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
laying on the on the edge we will look

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.450 
laying on the on the edge we will look
through<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.350> usually<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:26.010> do<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
through this and I usually will do this

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.769 
through this and I usually will do this
against<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.119> light<00:00:27.359> source<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.949> window<00:00:29.779> and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
against a light source like a window and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.610 
against a light source like a window and
see<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.380> there's<00:00:31.619> any<00:00:31.920> gaps<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:34.380> neck<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
see if there's any gaps if the neck is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.709 
see if there's any gaps if the neck is
warped<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:36.059> will<00:00:36.210> start<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.840> gaps<00:00:37.170> under

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
warped we will start to see gaps under

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
warped we will start to see gaps under
the<00:00:39.719> straightedge<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.879> area<00:00:42.239> where<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the straightedge in the area where of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.760 
the straightedge in the area where of
the<00:00:42.899> greatest<00:00:43.260> warp<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.270> instrument

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
the greatest warp and on this instrument

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.729 
the greatest warp and on this instrument
there<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:47.039> no<00:00:47.489> warps<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.719> good<00:00:49.110> level

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
there are no warps this is a good level

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.819 
there are no warps this is a good level
neck<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.730> does<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.210> need<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.440> truss

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
neck so it does not need to have a truss

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
neck so it does not need to have a truss
rod<00:00:56.190> adjustment<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.809> let's<00:00:58.109> assume<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
rod adjustment but let's assume that it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.630 
rod adjustment but let's assume that it
does<00:00:59.879> need<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> truss<00:01:00.660> rod<00:01:00.960> adjustment<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:02.460> way

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
does need a truss rod adjustment the way

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
does need a truss rod adjustment the way
that<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.969> would<00:01:03.149> address<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that we would address that is to use the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.219 
that we would address that is to use the
truss<00:01:07.830> rod<00:01:07.950> adjustment<00:01:08.100> tool<00:01:09.110> finding<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
truss rod adjustment tool finding the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
truss rod adjustment tool finding the
truss<00:01:10.530> rod<00:01:11.060> Allen<00:01:12.350> socket<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.930> very

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
truss rod Allen socket and very

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.090 
truss rod Allen socket and very
carefully

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.340 

insert<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> neck<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
insert this in there and if the neck is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
insert this in there and if the neck is
warped<00:01:23.479> bowed<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.670> we<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.820> make<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
warped bowed a little bit we will make a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.130 
warped bowed a little bit we will make a
slight<00:01:27.570> adjustment<00:01:28.399> no<00:01:29.399> more<00:01:29.789> than<00:01:30.060> 1/4<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
slight adjustment no more than 1/4 of a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.160 
slight adjustment no more than 1/4 of a
turn<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> time<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.299> let<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.600> set<00:01:33.960> for

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
turn at a time and then let it set for

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.789 
turn at a time and then let it set for
10<00:01:34.350> minutes<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.659> if<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.990> adjusts<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
10 minutes and see if that adjusts the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.210 
10 minutes and see if that adjusts the
neck<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> level<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.689> come<00:01:39.960> back<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
neck to a level and then come back and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.679 
neck to a level and then come back and
test<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> again<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:44.789> only<00:01:44.970> danger<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.659> a

test it again the only danger with a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.800 
test it again the only danger with a
truss<00:01:45.990> rod<00:01:46.229> adjustment<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:47.250> don't<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.329> too<00:01:48.390> far

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
truss rod adjustment is don't go too far

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
truss rod adjustment is don't go too far
and<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.470> force<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.009> no<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:51.209> than<00:01:51.390> a
