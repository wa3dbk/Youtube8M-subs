 [Music] 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.670
 loses a mature air for example 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 after running over a point 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.449
 Subject so the vehicle can 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.589
 higher speeds except 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.589
 control 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 the tire no longer has the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.570
 necessary pages manager that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 vehicle lurches that can 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 lead to dangerous situations and in 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.460
 in every case the wheel has to be changed 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.619
 become 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.650
 that is uncomfortable for the driver 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.320
 the best spare tire is that one 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.850
 does not need 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.759
 Ripe tires have become so rare 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.680
 that a majority of all spare wheels the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.950
 Car manufacturer placed in the trunk 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.470
 have unused at the end of a car life 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.470
 the recycler lands it takes a lot 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.320
 place away and is hard kilos the one 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.240
 walking takes away fuel 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.799
 for these reasons, the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.840
 car manufacturer long after one 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.450
 full replacement for the spare tire 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.759
 to alternative cells smaller and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.159
 lighter wheels not and span sets with 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.440
 which a defective tire sealed 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.690
 and can be pumped up again 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.600
 which is extremely complicated 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.600
 and only with small leaks 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 is working 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.269
 At the emergency, the driver must also 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:17.250
 continue to change the wheel 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.959
 the best would be a mature one with the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.620
 you can continue even then 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.379
 if it is flat it happened 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.689
 development of different 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.909
 competing systems in michelin 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.709
 developed packs tire is located 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.959
 a piece of synthetic rubber ring 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.590
 in the event of a breakdown, the tread of the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.500
 It takes time to mature 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.180
 However, special rims that has with 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.530
 contributed to the system 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.530
 not enforced 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.160
 The same applies to conti support 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.900
 ring system in which a lighter 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.860
 Metal ring the tire in case of air loss 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.860
 supports 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.069
 the so-called run flat tire here 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.230
 played bmw a pioneering role 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.110
 however, driving without pressure in the ride 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.000
 and that with conventional fields 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.680
 it is a ride with 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.989
 reinforced planks of the self at 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.700
 total air loss almost the same 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.709
 keeps shape like an intact one 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.170
 Tires with factory preset the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.510
 stiffness of the run flat tire is like that 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.450
 high that the car driver hardly anything 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.880
 a lupine lust noticed that is one 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.019
 reason for that the legislator 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.560
 Generally with the equipment with 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.980
 an automatic 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.260
 prescribe tire pressure monitoring system 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.670
 who is in the event of a breakdown 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.920
 prescribed 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.470
 limit holds even at full 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.079
 payload allow the tire 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.239
 up to 200 kilometers stops before him 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.610
 strong work caused by the bike 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.080
 heat development finally the garaus 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.569
 makes 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.640
 [Music] 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.859
 The tire pressure monitor can be over a 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.079
 done in the mature sensor installed 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.319
 predominantly the pressure control takes place 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:15.060
 However, with the help of the sensors of the abs 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:17.489
 but also have system run flat noise 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.160
 mitigate the stiff flanks 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.840
 worsen the ride comfort 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.479
 significant manufacturers are in 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.090
 a conflict of interest on the one hand 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.000
 comfort is on the other side 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.160
 as long as possible not running in the 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.740
 the development process has that 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840
 shown last years are runflat 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.820
 mature significantly more supple 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.320
 but that alone is obviously enough 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.849
 not yet comprehensive 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.070
 enforce 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.199
 In addition, the safety tires 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.960
 significantly heavier and more expensive than 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.110
 conventional pneus and during assembly 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.229
 from runflat tires are just like the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.240
 Mount HP tires to the ultra high 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.729
 Performance tires with a height 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.490
 wide ratio of 50 or less 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.370
 a customized assembly machine and that 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.889
 associated know-how requirement for 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.889
 a flawless off and prepare 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.840
 After the pressure reduction of the rest of the pressure 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.930
 by unscrewing the benthin 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.310
 First, the upper one was used 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.310
 bead pressed by the consequence 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.430
 easiest to dismantle and 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.460
 Mounting positions with the indication of a 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.130
 indefinitely the valve has the 12 o'clock 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.070
 position and starts to press 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.190
 one on the position three o'clock or 9 o'clock 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.639
 to any existing 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.050
 Do not damage the pressure sensor 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.810
 The prints should shovel 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.840
 maximum 10 mm away from the rim 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.840
 all work is scheduled to mature 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.760
 So even dismantling done 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.060
 under plenty of use of bright 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.310
 Tire fitting here will be one 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.770
 even used on foaming fit 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.199
 when pushing the shovel should pro 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.690
 side so at the top and at the bottom 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.979
 Bead three to four times 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.020
 are recognized 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.280
 the imprint is machine 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.500
 limited at the side 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.750
 then it is done and 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.389
 tense the advice on the assembly 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.910
 table with the valve pointing upwards 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.389
 and stand in any position 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.760
 can 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.210
 the hand is always peoples from the outside 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.570
 Tension, the spontaneously apart 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.570
 drive 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:39.870
 With this device I can do the clowns 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.650
 drive back together for a short time then that 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.650
 hang up
