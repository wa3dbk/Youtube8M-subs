00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.029
 while walking or running at any 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 movement in our body at the same time 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.460
 dozens of different muscles work they all 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.009
 as you yourself must act 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.289
 in a certain order and how does the brain not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 gets confused where and when to send signals 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 for this he has a cerebellum if he 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.160
 it is difficult for a person to work properly 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 move at all in our brain for each 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.210
 cell fixed certain 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.669
 no extra functions they all take 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 different information sounds and smells 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.050
 images recognize and process them 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 to small children brain cells are capable 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 redeploy the accepting functions 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 neighboring neurons one of the puzzles of the brain 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 with age we lose this unique 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.200
 ability unfortunately the younger 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.600
 the child is the more developed plasticity 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 that is, this is the same learning ability and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.039
 universal squad of because than 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.289
 younger the cell is to those great features it 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.270
 can learn if scientists still 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.460
 don't know how our brain processes and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 sorts the received information then with 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.080
 anatomical point of view, he studied 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.150
 almost 99 percent we know what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 the area is responsible for seeing what kind of hearing 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.409
 smells view explore all these 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.130
 zone allows ultrasonic 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.280
 diagnostics 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 this method of rapid diagnosis screaming 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.350
 method and so she and valuable in our lives 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 we can now read the size of that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.470
 or another structure compare with the norm and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.970
 describe changes in pathology is not superfluous 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.409
 will remind you that it is absolutely 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 harmless and safe method 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.030
 research since ultrasound 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.130
 waves do not exert ionizing and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.909
 damaging effects on tissue and cells 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 where the brain is shown to all threads 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.780
 her complaint no complaints age at 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.140
 birth at three months at six months in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 year 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 adults in traumatic brain injury 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.860
 almost immediately after injury and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 three months after injury to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.190
 the brain perfectly controls the muscles without 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.170
 our knowledge is worth only 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 slipping and the body itself is trying to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.520
 keep balance imagine if 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 would we think so as not to fall i need 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.600
 lean in the other direction then already 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.970
 would long ago lay on the ground it turns out that 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.739
 the brain acts faster than thought therefore 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.739
 take care of him and be healthy
