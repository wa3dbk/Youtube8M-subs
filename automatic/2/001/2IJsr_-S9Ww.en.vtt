00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.179 
alone nine goals the difference between
us<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.810> Chelsea<00:03:04.139> so<00:03:04.349> we're<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.859> are<00:03:05.040> going

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
us and Chelsea so we're if we are going

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.429 
us and Chelsea so we're if we are going
to<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.459> pressuring<00:03:06.419> for<00:03:06.449> that<00:03:06.810> top<00:03:07.049> spot<00:03:07.079> we

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
to be pressuring for that top spot we

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.809 
to be pressuring for that top spot we
are<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> need<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:08.010> ensure<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.579> do

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
are going to need to ensure that we do

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.399 
are going to need to ensure that we do
pick<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.120> some<00:03:09.359> better<00:03:09.540> results<00:03:09.659> than<00:03:10.169> Chelsea

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
pick up some better results than Chelsea

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.780 
pick up some better results than Chelsea
because<00:03:10.799> obviously<00:03:10.919> their<00:03:11.310> goal<00:03:11.459> difference

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
because obviously their goal difference

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.539 
because obviously their goal difference
is<00:03:11.969> pretty<00:03:12.810> superior<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.949> ours<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.400> they're

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
is pretty superior to ours and they're

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.129 
is pretty superior to ours and they're
not<00:03:14.699> exactly<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.329> losing<00:03:15.569> heavily

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
not exactly going to be losing heavily

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.059 
not exactly going to be losing heavily
in<00:03:16.319> any<00:03:16.500> games

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
in any games

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.710 
in any games
you<00:03:17.459> wouldn't<00:03:17.819> think<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.449> near<00:03:18.569> future

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you wouldn't think in the near future
