year<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.640> we're<00:04:32.760> probably<00:04:32.850> building<00:04:33.180> some

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
year so we're probably building some

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
year so we're probably building some
momentum<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.780> wouldn't<00:04:33.990> carry<00:04:34.140> there<00:04:34.290> at

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
momentum that wouldn't carry there at

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.870 
momentum that wouldn't carry there at
Darlington<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.580> got<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.730> think

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
Darlington so just got to think

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.370
