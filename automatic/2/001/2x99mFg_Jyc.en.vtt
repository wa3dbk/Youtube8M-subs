00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
surface Mars is different both because

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.519 
surface Mars is different both because
its<00:01:20.279> atmosphere<00:01:20.849> is<00:01:20.880> only<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.869> percent<00:01:22.200> the

its atmosphere is only one percent the

its atmosphere is only one percent the
thickness<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.099> Earth<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:23.779> it<00:01:24.779> doesn't<00:01:24.959> have

an inherent magnetic field to repel the

charged particles

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.459

so<00:01:30.210> there's<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.570> primary<00:01:31.020> sources<00:01:31.350> of

so there's two primary sources of

so there's two primary sources of
