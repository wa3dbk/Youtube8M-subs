00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
if the game is fun that's not the point

I've<00:01:57.450> talked<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.869> why<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I've talked about why I think in the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.399 
I've talked about why I think in the
future<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.880> hardware<00:02:00.299> limitations<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.170> both

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
future the hardware limitations of both

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
future the hardware limitations of both
of<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.770> next-gen<00:02:02.340> systems<00:02:02.790> could<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.030> an

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
of these next-gen systems could be an

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.810 
of these next-gen systems could be an
issue<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.219> thing<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.579> funny

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
issue but what the thing that's funny

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.100 
issue but what the thing that's funny
about<00:02:05.909> these<00:02:06.210> developers<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:06.960> don't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
about these developers was they don't

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
about these developers was they don't
get<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.469> reason<00:02:07.860> why<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> big<00:02:08.819> deal

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
get is the reason why this is a big deal

second<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:46.910> spent<00:02:47.910> more<00:02:48.300> money<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.650> get<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
second I spent more money to get a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.980 
second I spent more money to get a
system<00:02:50.400> where<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> multi<00:02:51.090> plats<00:02:51.360> perform

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
system where the multi plats perform

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.780 
system where the multi plats perform
crappier<00:02:53.540> that's<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.170> issue<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.790> even

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
crappier that's what the issue is even

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.600 
crappier that's what the issue is even
if<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.090> lies<00:02:57.270> was<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.780> okay<00:02:58.230> say<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> game<00:02:58.830> like

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
if it lies was like okay say a game like

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.390 
if it lies was like okay say a game like
battlefield<00:03:00.390> 5<00:03:00.660> comes<00:03:01.050> out<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.950> runs<00:03:02.160> at

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
one are you gonna see the difference

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
one are you gonna see the difference
with<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.300> line<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.870> resolution<00:03:10.560> no

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
with that one line of resolution no

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580 
with that one line of resolution no
you're<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.940> but<00:03:12.660> people<00:03:12.900> are<00:03:13.170> still<00:03:13.410> gonna<00:03:13.500> be

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
you're not but people are still gonna be

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.610 
you're not but people are still gonna be
like<00:03:13.770> what<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.950> fuck<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.640> spent<00:03:15.390> $100<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.410> in

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
like what the fuck I spent $100 more in

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
like what the fuck I spent $100 more in
this<00:03:16.770> system<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.460> it<00:03:18.210> can't<00:03:18.480> perform<00:03:18.960> as<00:03:19.080> well

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
this system and it can't perform as well

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.460 
this system and it can't perform as well
as<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.590> system<00:03:19.980> that's<00:03:20.220> $100<00:03:21.000> cheaper<00:03:21.540> that's

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
as the system that's $100 cheaper that's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.650 
as the system that's $100 cheaper that's
why<00:03:22.890> even<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.520> that's<00:03:23.760> why<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.390> big<00:03:24.630> deal

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
why even a that's why it's a big deal

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.140 
why even a that's why it's a big deal
even<00:03:25.230> though<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> game<00:03:25.680> will<00:03:26.010> look<00:03:26.250> pretty

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
even though the game will look pretty

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.200 
even though the game will look pretty
close<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.140> ps4<00:03:28.470> version<00:03:28.770> even<00:03:29.730> though

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
close to the ps4 version even though

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.420 
close to the ps4 version even though
it's<00:03:30.480> gonna<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.080> same<00:03:31.350> experience<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
it's gonna be the same experience and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.010

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
maybe that's a bad analogy but it kind

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.390 
maybe that's a bad analogy but it kind
of<00:04:24.300> makes<00:04:24.479> sense<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:25.410> why<00:04:25.830> people<00:04:26.100> are

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.810 
of makes sense that's why people are
making

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
making

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.910 
making
it's<00:04:26.970> not<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.660> resolution<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.800> of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
it's not that the resolution in and of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.640 
it's not that the resolution in and of
itself<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.580> big<00:04:29.880> deal<00:04:30.090> when<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:30.870> spend<00:04:31.230> more

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650
