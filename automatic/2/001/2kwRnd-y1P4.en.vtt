00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Decepticon tin-can and Ironhide I think

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.890 
Decepticon tin-can and Ironhide I think
you<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> pretty<00:01:38.850> good<00:01:39.030> Decepticon

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you would make a pretty good Decepticon

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.100 
you would make a pretty good Decepticon
because<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:41.100> he<00:01:41.490> wants<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.360> destroy

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because all he wants to do is destroy

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.179 
because all he wants to do is destroy
them<00:01:43.350> all<00:01:43.560> though<00:01:43.710> his<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.310> guess<00:01:44.579> honor<00:01:45.180> his

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
them all though his I guess honor his

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.280 
them all though his I guess honor his
trustworthiness<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> his<00:01:47.610> personality<00:01:48.360> make

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
trustworthiness and his personality make

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.440 
trustworthiness and his personality make
him<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.979> autobot<00:01:50.520> he<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.119> rough

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
him more of an autobot he is rough

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
him more of an autobot he is rough
around<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.869> edges<00:01:52.130> not<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.520> talking

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
around the edges not one for talking

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.679 
around the edges not one for talking
because<00:01:54.509> talking's<00:01:55.409> talking<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.689> destroying

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
because talking's talking and destroying

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.490
