out a lot of more videos to the fact

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.509 
out a lot of more videos to the fact
that<00:04:53.120> as<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.510> said<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:53.810> my<00:04:53.840> updated

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:54.519 
that as I said in my updated

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.159 
that as I said in my updated
I'm<00:04:55.519> going<00:04:55.879> to<00:04:55.939> be<00:04:55.999> working<00:04:56.119> on<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.389> small<00:04:56.839> short

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
I'm going to be working on a small short

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.379 
I'm going to be working on a small short
and<00:04:57.610> that's<00:04:58.610> what<00:04:58.729> can<00:04:58.819> be<00:04:58.909> taken<00:04:59.089> up<00:04:59.179> a<00:04:59.239> lot<00:04:59.330> of

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
and that's what can be taken up a lot of

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.239 
and that's what can be taken up a lot of
my<00:04:59.539> time<00:04:59.569> but<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:00.229> still<00:05:00.409> want<00:05:00.589> to<00:05:00.649> launch<00:05:00.860> video

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:01.249 
my time but I still want to launch video

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.009 
my time but I still want to launch video
so<00:05:01.519> I'm<00:05:01.610> figuring<00:05:01.819> it<00:05:02.419> usually<00:05:02.689> takes<00:05:02.899> about

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:03.019 
so I'm figuring it usually takes about

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:04.779 
so I'm figuring it usually takes about
two<00:05:03.349> days<00:05:03.499> for<00:05:03.739> one<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.919> my<00:05:03.979> videos<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.369> hit<00:05:04.489> 100

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
two days for one of my videos to hit 100

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.219 
two days for one of my videos to hit 100
views<00:05:04.999> so<00:05:06.159> launching<00:05:07.159> like<00:05:07.689> five<00:05:08.689> videos

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
views so launching like five videos

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.079 
views so launching like five videos
should<00:05:10.159> take<00:05:10.339> me<00:05:10.459> like<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.789> know<00:05:10.879> like<00:05:10.909> a
