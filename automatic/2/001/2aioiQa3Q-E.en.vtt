00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.680
 now contains instructions for 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.299
 facilitate its installation but sometimes it is 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.860
 easy to be wrong 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.420
 these are some of the most 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.420
 important things to remember 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.990
 If you want to add accessories you can 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 check the total amperage by adding 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.040
 the amps for accessories can 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.290
 find the amperage on the label 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.579
 silver that is on the side of 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.679
 the filter tower 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.140
 if the pump is on but the water 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.750
 does not go in there may be air trapped in 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.690
 the hose if it is a pump 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.979
 small with type cartridge a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.469
 disconnect the pump from the current 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.839
 electric remove any block that has 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.640
 overlooked and open the valve 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.359
 leak the filter strap so that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.359
 leave the air 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.890
 if it is a major pump with 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.780
 cartridges type of closing valves 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.390
 of the pool and open the valve 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.840
 escape from the piston tower for the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.620
 633 and 635 models open the valve 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.690
 lower and then the upper 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.550
 you may have to move the hose 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.460
 up and down for the air to come out 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.250
 by the valve 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.470
 the 633 model has a valve 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.420
 escape over the support connection 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.420
 of the engine that can also be opened 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.930
 before opening the purifier for 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.970
 check the filter cartridge turn off 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 and disconnect the purifier and close the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 valves and manifolds or if the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 pool does not have valves connect the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 holes of the connectors with the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.200
 tanks 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 if you can not find filter cartridges and their 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 can request them by calling

 directly to the customer service 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.810
 index consumer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.680
 It is very important that you have a 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.560
 exit 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.869
 efe before installing the treatment plant 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.630
 the current interruption circuit 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.119
 of the output etc and it's much more sensitive 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.250
 and it can save lives because it stops the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.399
 electrical current when it detects 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.399
 problem 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.300
 if you perform maintenance and cleaning 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.970

 every two weeks to see if you need 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.050
 replace it 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 first turn off disconnects the purifier and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.670
 they close the valves and the connectors or 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.950
 If the pool does not have valves connect 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.130
 the holes of the connectors with the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.200
 tacos 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.780
 to remove more easily 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.980
 Clamp of the filter frame open 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.040
 Carefully the exhaust valve 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.080
 top remove the filter clamp 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.070
 superior with a turn in the direction 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.860
 hourly 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.400
 Then remove the cover of the filter isaac 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.409
 the cartridge 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.319
 If the cartridge is dirty or colored 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.360
 brown clean it a little with water if not 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.430
 you can clean it easily you should 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 replace 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.740
 insert the appropriate filter cartridge 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 for each model of sewage treatment before 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.820
 Replace the cartridge as shown 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.850
 Indicate and replace the clamp

 of the filter in the frame close the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.980
 air exhaust valve now repeat 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.160
 the steps indicated in the opposite direction 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.990
 to re-activate the pump open a 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.520
 little the air valve to let that 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.520
 escape the trapped air 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.500
