00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
some suspicions that perhaps he had been

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.030 
some suspicions that perhaps he had been
poisoned<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.540> would<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.810> been

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
poisoned and that would have been

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
poisoned and that would have been
arsenic<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.700> ran<00:01:39.060> tests<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.900> modern

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
arsenic so they ran tests with modern

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
arsenic so they ran tests with modern
science<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> find<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.390> had<00:01:42.509> indeed

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
science to find out if he had indeed

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
science to find out if he had indeed
been<00:01:43.020> poisoned<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.460> results<00:01:44.850> were

been poisoned and the results were

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
been poisoned and the results were
conclusive<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.720> that's<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:46.799> happened

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
