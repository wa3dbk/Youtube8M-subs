00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
important that the floor then sits very

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.330 
important that the floor then sits very
well<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.149> water<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:59.020> Ray<00:01:59.289> because<00:01:59.950> it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
well in the water and the Ray because it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.209 
well in the water and the Ray because it
has<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> slight<00:02:01.450> flat<00:02:02.079> on<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.439> top<00:02:02.649> here<00:02:02.950> just

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
has a slight flat on the top here just

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.999 
has a slight flat on the top here just
seems<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:04.060> sit<00:02:04.329> very<00:02:04.359> very<00:02:04.810> nice<00:02:05.259> when<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.740> run
