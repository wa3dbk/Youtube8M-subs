00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 Is yours equal and 50-150 everyone likes 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.199
 feel smart after all 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 geniuses like testein or hockey 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 no doubt helped make the world such 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.609
 what he is but is it possible genetically 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.800
 improve the intelligence of our whole species 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.320
 dna is the code of life inherent in any living 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 body and dna consists of genes which 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 in turn compiled with 4 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 nitrogenous bases which denote 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 letters a td and c in people these grounds 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 is 3 billion pairs which 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
 Essentially are instructions all 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.719
 you need to make the cells of your body all that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.610
 we are from appearance to behavior 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 explained by the organization of these four 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.699
 biological compounds and scientists have found 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 connection between the organization of genes and 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.390
 some features that you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.230
 possess from the floor and eye color to 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.129
 diseases that can develop you 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 analyze and compare for the first time 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.360
 human body genes started in the project 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.460
 human genome on the initial project 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.530
 It took more than 10 years and 3 billion dollars 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 teams worked together on it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 the whole globe is now the same 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 can be done in a few days with 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.110
 smaller team and in just 4 thousand 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.330
 dollars and the more consistent 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 genomes we collect from plants microbes 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 or people the more we can compare and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.840
 contrast external signs with 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.350
 a combination of genes that we find 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 inside 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.740
 this is exactly what the project is cognitive 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.740
 speakers hope to achieve 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.560
 exploring over 2,000 people article above 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.869
 150 plan to contribute another 20 thousand 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.000
 Institute researchers tested Beja 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.280
 and in China are looking for a genetic background 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.290
 intelligence and in other words they study 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 dna thousands of smart people to find 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.600
 structures responsible first 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.579
 for their intelligence of course it is much 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 more difficult than identifying genetic 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.140
 Disease disease Sachs and Syndrome 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.100
 huntington induced single mutation 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.930
 gene to reveal which is easy in 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.880
 lasso and eye color at the same time depends 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.530
 from a variety of interacting genes but 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.539
 with careful analysis of them too 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.580
 predict but features like 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.590
 intelligence is almost certainly the result 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.450
 unique interaction of thousands of genes 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.400
 which scientists have yet to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.780
 open and it is never possible 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.910
 succeeds but what if it works out then 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.470
 may be the future of children geniuses with 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.239
 the appearance of extracorporeal 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.310
 fertilization you can create 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.220
 many embryos and scan their dna 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.170
 then scientists based on genes can 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 recognize which characteristics most 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.340
 likely for each embryo per se 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 allowing parents to choose which 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.780
 baby they most want 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.850
 for example, this embryo has 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.459
 50% chance of becoming great 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.250
 a musician and this one has 58 percent 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.930
 such more than 150 in this case are not 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.040
 changes genetic information a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.140
 rather following her 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 we really can increase 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.640
 future generations intelligence
