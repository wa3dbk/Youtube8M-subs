00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 sigh the pixar movies are a 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.180
 symbol of talent and innovation in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.480
 the animation cinema we have 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.850
 and the most important thing is that if we go 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.620
 together after the great success in the museum 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360
 of modern art from new york 'with 2 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.280
 millions of visitors land in 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.350
 barcelona an exhibition that reveal the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 keys to the success and evolution of pixar 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.340
 since its inception 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 has a very long trajectory it 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.600
 starts in 2005 in the moma 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.410
 then it was only 20 years of 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:29.560
 animation at 25 and crosses Australia 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.770
 Japan China Mexico The United Kingdom Italy 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.770
 france holland 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.190
 you come here is like going back to childhood 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 truth that gives taste I like a lot about 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 all the drawings the traced by hand 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.140
 it's super interesting 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 and 400 pieces that illustrate these 25 years 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.800
 of animation in pixar and that really 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.810
 they are endearing because all of me believe that 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.430
 not all people who have 35 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.620
 years down have grown 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.410
 practically with pixar and those that have 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.680
 from 35 up have accompanied their 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.680
 children 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.399
 ah 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 in it we can discover this magical 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.560
 world and the processes of creating a 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.690
 animation film in its different phases 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.739
 and what we can see is his story his 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.000
 path through 12 films 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.610
 analyzed from the point of view of what 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.140
 that john lasseter says it's the keys 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.420
 of the animation not that is to have some 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.360
 good characters have a good 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.640
 history and have a good created universe 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.739
 a world where those characters live 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.739
 I dream to our friends their new home 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.700
 30 years ago talk about 3d animation was 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.739
 practically doing it in Chinese nobody 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.690
 understood its scope for what it would serve 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.819
 and even worse who would risk 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.190
 make a movie in its entirety 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.680
 with digital animation effects 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.170
 but it happened after the premiere of toy 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.170
 story in 1995 everything changed 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.600
 the pixar studies have been innovative 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.730
 in digital animation cinema by 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.680
 computer and have set a milestone in the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.690
 movie history and this can go 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120
 watching throughout the exhibition to 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.160
 through the models of the drawings of 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.930
 the storyboards we will discover the talent 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.970
 and the creativity of the artists that 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.700
 make it possible for this great factory to 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 dreams work perfectly 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.470
 harvesting so far 26 awards 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.750

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.910
 half of the pixar professionals do not 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.790
 are how we might think experts in 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.940
 computer software experts 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.450
 realization but they are creators 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.820
 artists artists people who are 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.580

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.830
 pencil with the sculpture creating those 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.590
 worlds creating those characters that then 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.480
 with the technology tool it 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.040
