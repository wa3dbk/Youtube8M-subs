that's impossible for the kids to open

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040 
that's impossible for the kids to open
then<00:05:01.729> that<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.330> know<00:05:02.450> then<00:05:02.630> somebody<00:05:02.930> could

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
then that you know then somebody could

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.779 
then that you know then somebody could
help<00:05:03.140> them<00:05:03.289> with<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.560> but<00:05:03.710> largely<00:05:03.979> I<00:05:04.280> like

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
help them with it but largely I like

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.090 
help them with it but largely I like
them<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.090> just<00:05:05.270> take<00:05:05.390> care<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.660> themselves

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
them to just take care of themselves

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.590 
them to just take care of themselves
well<00:05:07.100> if<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.669> got<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.820> babysitter<00:05:08.090> hoot<00:05:08.419> and

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
well if you got a babysitter hoot and

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.450 
well if you got a babysitter hoot and
they<00:05:08.990> do<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.169> good<00:05:09.410> job<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.919> the<00:05:10.070> kids<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:10.430> it

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
they do a good job and the kids like it

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.640 
they do a good job and the kids like it
then<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.630> think<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:11.960> makes<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.289> mother<00:05:12.440> look

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
then I think it makes the mother look

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.529 
then I think it makes the mother look
bad<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:13.010> don't<00:05:13.310> know<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.610> if<00:05:13.820> this<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.270> like<00:05:14.390> the

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
bad I don't know it if this is like the

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.850 
bad I don't know it if this is like the
