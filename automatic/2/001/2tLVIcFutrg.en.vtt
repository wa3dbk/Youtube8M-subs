00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
good condition they usually last a long

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.089 
good condition they usually last a long
time<00:00:24.930> especially<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.830> wear<00:00:25.949> them

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
time especially if you don't wear them

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
time especially if you don't wear them
like<00:00:26.460> me<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:28.099> these<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.369> Halloween<00:00:29.960> long

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:43.050 
like me so these are for Halloween long
time<00:00:31.170> ago<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> vampire<00:00:32.510> handles<00:00:33.510> them<00:00:33.660> in

you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.319 

so<00:00:48.550> obviously<00:00:48.910> they're<00:00:49.090> not<00:00:49.210> natural<00:00:49.690> looking

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so obviously they're not natural looking

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.439 
so obviously they're not natural looking
but<00:00:52.329> they<00:00:52.510> are<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.719> pretty<00:00:53.350> dramatic<00:00:53.710> I<00:01:00.449> like

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.749 

lead<00:01:26.289> eyelashes<00:01:26.890> are<00:01:27.009> really<00:01:27.250> long<00:01:27.460> and

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
lead eyelashes are really long and

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.040 
lead eyelashes are really long and
annoying<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.240> they<00:01:28.360> actually<00:01:28.509> make<00:01:28.810> my<00:01:28.929> eyes

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
annoying and they actually make my eyes

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.660 
annoying and they actually make my eyes
water<00:01:29.080> so<00:01:29.560> it's<00:01:29.710> not<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:30.009> contacts<00:01:30.399> it'sthe

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
water so it's not the contacts it'sthe

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.330 
water so it's not the contacts it'sthe
eyelashes<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:32.380> get<00:01:32.560> into<00:01:32.679> my<00:01:32.710> vision<00:01:33.220> they

eyelashes they get into my vision they

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.499 
eyelashes they get into my vision they
actually<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.759> like<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:33.909> think<00:01:34.119> they<00:01:34.179> touch<00:01:34.360> my

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
actually can like I think they touch my

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.240 
actually can like I think they touch my
eye<00:01:34.539> I<00:01:34.960> think<00:01:35.380> they're<00:01:35.500> touching<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.860> contact

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
eye I think they're touching the contact

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:51.100 
eye I think they're touching the contact
go<00:01:37.149> in<00:01:37.240> front<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.479> my<00:01:37.569> softbox<00:01:38.140> here

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.710 

so<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.440> that<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.580> review<00:01:54.450> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so that is that that does my review on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.900 
so that is that that does my review on
these<00:01:54.900> clearly<00:01:55.320> colors<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> get<00:01:56.790> these

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
these clearly colors you can get these

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.980 
these clearly colors you can get these
from

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
from

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.060 
from
I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:59.010> Coastal<00:01:59.840> Contacts<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.800> sells

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I think Coastal Contacts still sells

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.680 
I think Coastal Contacts still sells
these<00:02:02.310> otherwise<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.510> in<00:02:03.570> other

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
these otherwise they can get in other

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.080 
these otherwise they can get in other
places<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.470> another<00:02:04.890> thing<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.400> there's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
places and another thing is there's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
places and another thing is there's
another<00:02:06.300> brand<00:02:06.660> that<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.050> pretty<00:02:07.470> much<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
another brand that is pretty much the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
another brand that is pretty much the
exact<00:02:08.250> same<00:02:08.280> lens<00:02:08.880> it's<00:02:09.240> just<00:02:09.420> called

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
exact same lens it's just called

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.240 
exact same lens it's just called
something<00:02:10.380> different<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.830> called<00:02:11.009> color

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
something different it's called color

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.940 
something different it's called color
max<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.030> I've<00:02:12.690> seen<00:02:12.900> pictures<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.380> I've<00:02:13.740> seen

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
max and I've seen pictures and I've seen

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.940 
max and I've seen pictures and I've seen
reviews<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.700> look<00:02:14.910> identical<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
reviews and they look identical and I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
reviews and they look identical and I
think<00:02:17.130> they<00:02:17.190> even<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.580> same<00:02:17.760> name

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
think they even have the same name

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.810 
think they even have the same name
Aquatica<00:02:18.930> word<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.860> they're<00:02:20.070> aqua<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.610> like

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
Aquatica word so they're aqua I like

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
Aquatica word so they're aqua I like
them<00:02:20.970> they're<00:02:21.090> more<00:02:21.570> blue<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> me<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
them they're more blue to me I think the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.440 
them they're more blue to me I think the
actual<00:02:23.310> blue<00:02:23.520> ones<00:02:23.700> are<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:23.880> bit<00:02:24.060> darker

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
actual blue ones are a little bit darker

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
actual blue ones are a little bit darker
so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.630> do<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.959> these<00:02:25.140> better<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:25.950> you're

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130

going<00:02:26.370> more<00:02:26.520> for<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.790> light<00:02:27.000> blue<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> uh<00:02:28.820> they

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going more for the light blue so uh they

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.840 
going more for the light blue so uh they
make<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.150> eyes<00:02:30.209> look<00:02:30.300> cute<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:31.010> anyway<00:02:32.010> okay
