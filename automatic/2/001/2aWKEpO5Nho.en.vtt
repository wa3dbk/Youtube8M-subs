00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
i've done it like three times or four

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.740 
i've done it like three times or four
times<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> past<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.309> five<00:00:41.520> days<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:42.510> four

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
