going to be a fun idea to try this out
so<00:00:12.240> yeah<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.320> started<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.099> my

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
so yeah I'm going to get started and my

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.369 
so yeah I'm going to get started and my
squishy<00:00:15.089> collection<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.870> right<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.289> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
squishy collection is right in front of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.859 
squishy collection is right in front of
me<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.600> box<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.619> there<00:00:20.869> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
me which is in this box right there so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.679 
me which is in this box right there so
the<00:00:22.199> first<00:00:22.410> question<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:24.029> squishy<00:00:24.390> are

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the first question is what squishy are

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.040 
the first question is what squishy are
you<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> most<00:00:25.109> comfortable<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.949> squish<00:00:26.250> what

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
you the most comfortable to squish what

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
you the most comfortable to squish what
so<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.760> think<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.029> probable<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.779> barrel

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so I think it's probable in this barrel

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040 
so I think it's probable in this barrel
