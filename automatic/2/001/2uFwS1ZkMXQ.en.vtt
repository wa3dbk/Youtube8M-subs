00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.540
In the very dry area of Dogon Doutchi

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
a city at east Niamey in Niger,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
famine is present since 2005.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Many renutrition programs

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.100
 leaded by the governement and internationals NGO

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
are currently established in renutrition centers

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 for kids and breast feeding mothers.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:35.143
These centers are present in all the country and they are called

00:00:36.418 --> 00:00:42.418
CRENI, CRENAM or CRENAS, depending on the severity of the cases they treat.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
Since september 2010, the Monaco Red Cross

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:49.325
 started in this area a food security program

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 including Spirulina as a food complement

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.149
Spirulina is a cyanobacterium close to a micro alga

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.539
 it is full of rich nutritional benefits

00:01:02.044 --> 00:01:05.044
"We are successfull in getting children back to healthy weight

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
Our success rate is between 90% and 100%.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040
The situation is still very difficult 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
but in our CRENI and with the help of others organisations

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:18.101
we can be happy of how the children are getting well

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Without Spirulina it will take longer

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 but by putting Spirulina in the renutrition program

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:29.431
children are getting better faster 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it adds a lot of proteins in their food.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280
We really got the children back to a healthy weigh a lot faster 

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:38.456
than without spirulina."

00:01:39.522 --> 00:01:41.520
To get enough Spirulina for the program, 

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:43.260
Monaco Red Cross started a partnership with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
the Spirulina Farm of Doutchi

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.310
Due to the weather

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
production can vary a lot along a year,

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.120
it is way highest at the hot season.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
The hardest season is rain season 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.750
basins get full of rain water

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:07.860
we have to empty them, refill them and we loose a lot.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.720
At the moment, the production is quite good

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.250
between 41 kilos last month

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.520
 and 50 kilos the month before, 

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:31.780
so you can see it is a bit capricious.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
On site the essential partners of Monaco Red Cross

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.090
 are the care staff of health centers.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Today is dispensing day in Mai Kalgo's health center!

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:47.310
The head nurse welcomes the mums and their children

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640
to weigh them, measure them

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800
and give them the right quantity of spirulina for a week.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.340
He also discuss with them on the best way to use spirulina

00:02:55.473 --> 00:02:57.470
and integrate it in their daily diet.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
Some of the mums put it in the porridge and some others

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 in a rice preparation, or even sometimes in the family dish.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They use a coffee spoon to know how much spirulina 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.620
 they give to the child (1 spoon is about 5 gramms)

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Another aim of the program is to realise

00:03:39.578 --> 00:03:42.580
a unique comparative study above spirulina's real effects.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Therefore, 1000 monitoring sheets of 2009

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880
of children non-treated with spirulina

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:51.630
 will be compared with the sheets of 2010

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400
of children treated with spirulina.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
The all program is done in collaboration

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.320
with the Nigerien Red Cross

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.080
Some studies have already been done on spirulina

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.460
 but no study had ever been done

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.300
about the addition of spirulina to other healing food

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.600
like pre-mix, plum peanut...

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:23.490
I think we are the firsts to do it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.480
anyway in the Red Cross/Crescent Movement

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200
I'm sure we are the firsts!

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.720
We'll know the results and what follows during year 2011.
