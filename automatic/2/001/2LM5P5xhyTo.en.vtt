I'm<00:00:48.149> floating<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.629> against<00:00:48.899> all<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:51.030> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I'm floating out against all it was it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.700 
I'm floating out against all it was it
was<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> pretty<00:00:51.719> pleasing<00:00:52.020> performance<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
was a pretty pleasing performance in

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
was a pretty pleasing performance in
terms<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.370> discipline<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.390> reaction<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
terms of discipline and reaction to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
terms of discipline and reaction to
adversity<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.039> reaction<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.610> errors<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
adversity and reaction to our errors and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.260 
adversity and reaction to our errors and
reaction<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> call<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.170> roughly<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.149> all

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
reaction to a call from roughly but all

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
reaction to a call from roughly but all
in<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.570> every<00:01:00.809> single<00:01:00.960> game<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.530> in

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
in that every single game they're all in

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.080 
in that every single game they're all in
there<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.579> deal<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.000> them

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
there it's just how we deal with them

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.549 
there it's just how we deal with them
and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> thought<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.570> deal<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.049> impeccable

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and I thought we deal with it impeccable

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.620 
and I thought we deal with it impeccable
you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> guess<00:01:05.610> both<00:01:05.790> teams<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.450> we'll

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
you know I guess both teams and we'll

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.700 
you know I guess both teams and we'll
take<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.200> game<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.590> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
take a bit out of that game that we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910 
take a bit out of that game that we
played<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.580> Friday<00:01:08.850> night<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.710> both<00:01:10.710> things

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
played on Friday night and both things

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.590 
played on Friday night and both things
we<00:01:11.040> better<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> uniqueness<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we better get the uniqueness of a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.330 
we better get the uniqueness of a
knockout<00:01:13.260> competition<00:01:13.799> always<00:01:14.010> brings<00:01:14.189> out<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
knockout competition always brings out a

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460 
knockout competition always brings out a
bit<00:01:14.520> more<00:01:14.610> intensity<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
bit more intensity and you know you can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.660 
bit more intensity and you know you can
practice<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> few<00:01:17.250> things<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> could

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
practice on a few things that you could

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
practice on a few things that you could
have<00:01:17.759> done<00:01:17.820> better<00:01:17.970> during<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:19.140> got

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
have done better during that game we got

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
have done better during that game we got
some<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.560> big<00:01:19.740> positive<00:01:20.070> taken<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.490> like

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
some really big positive taken out like

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
some really big positive taken out like
and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.350> we're

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
and then you know we know what we're

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890 
and then you know we know what we're
trying<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.729> achieve<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.030> working<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.780> us

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
trying to achieve is working but for us

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.219 
trying to achieve is working but for us

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
déjà that is the danger we just could be

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
déjà that is the danger we just could be
aware<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.460> different<00:01:35.790> game<00:01:35.939> against
