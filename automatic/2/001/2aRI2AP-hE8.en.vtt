00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello I am only on the donation of the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.960
 scorpions guitarist and composer 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.250
 I have actually with gibson yes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 since the beginning of the 80s 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.430
 cooperated because for me it was sooner 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.790
 or later, there's a bad mark 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.239
 that was my heart especially 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 also by the flying like more so to speak 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.610
 over johnny winter a nice poster 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 by johnny winter with the plan goes because 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.560
 they said this guitar 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.570
 I have to play the hammer so and so 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.030
 previously not played gibson already 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.380
 but then that was for me the la witt 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.060
 first sight becomes the thing, so to speak 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.110
 point where I said that some 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.610
 days and since then I play consequence 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.270
 maybe there are times here and there 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.070
 another brand but for me it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.090
 gibson the guitar brand that's what 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.170
 the sound and the quality and stuff 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.990
 continues 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 that gave I gave it over like 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010
 bad, but that is very often that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 fink on 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.880
 middle of the 80s or beginning of the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.690
 80s where ever 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 black and white scorpions series came out 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.210
 that was also the end of the 80s was so 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.299
 built a series then in 90s gave 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.400
 it's another series where 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.220
 black and white flying like it did 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.420
 then gibson have been started with 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 done the signal 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.400
 Of course I thought there was good 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.909
 if there was a final tour and stuff 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.250
 continue and I am now known for it 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.189
 to play vital would be great if there are 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.080
 it would make such a pad again 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.150
 and i'm very good with chris adams 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.100
 friends and Rudolf has no 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.819
 problem I will recite the same 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.250
 and then henry has the boss of 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.799
 Gibson recited and the body immediately 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.290
 and as I know I do not know if 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.730
 that's true but it will be four stop 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.120
 I feel the guitars 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.610
 biggest edition so far 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.290
 to a larger edition and then 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.769
 I'm glad about that again 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.420
 my career as a guitarist and as a 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.090
 laien how players can top again 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.030
 with this signature guitar comes to it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.150
 yes even that was a book 100 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.879
 years gibson that I'm there as the flyniki 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.670

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.980
 that makes me extremely happy and that I like that 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.739
 long endured with a 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 guitar company and I now therefore 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.940
 I'm sure you have the biggest collection 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.209
 I think so why look around the world 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.209
