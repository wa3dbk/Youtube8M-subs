kit as a gift when I was a kid
although<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.020> something<00:00:46.530> appealing

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
although there is something appealing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
although there is something appealing
that<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.700> blow<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that you can just blow into it and get a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
that you can just blow into it and get a
nice<00:00:49.230> sounding<00:00:50.010> harmony<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.210> bat

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
nice sounding harmony right off the bat

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.930 
nice sounding harmony right off the bat
without<00:00:51.719> having<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.260> anything

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.070 

that's<00:01:00.940> pretty<00:01:01.180> cool<00:01:01.450> without<00:01:01.810> doing

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
that's pretty cool without doing

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.020 
that's pretty cool without doing
anything<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.500> sounds<00:01:02.650> great<00:01:03.040> just<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:03.910> by

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
anything it sounds great just that by

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.210 
anything it sounds great just that by
itself<00:01:04.059> is<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.870> musically<00:01:05.530> fulfilling<00:01:05.950> I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
itself is kind of musically fulfilling I

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.970 
itself is kind of musically fulfilling I
didn't<00:01:06.460> get<00:01:06.550> very<00:01:06.730> far<00:01:07.030> with<00:01:07.300> the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
didn't get very far with the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.110 
didn't get very far with the
instructions<00:01:08.980> in<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.670> book<00:01:09.850> or<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
instructions in the in the book or the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.050 
instructions in the in the book or the
cassette<00:01:10.510> partly<00:01:11.200> because<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.800> music<00:01:12.490> left<00:01:12.880> a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
cassette partly because the music left a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.240 
cassette partly because the music left a
lot<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.390> be<00:01:13.510> desired<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:14.260> just<00:01:14.470> wasn't<00:01:15.100> very

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
lot to be desired it just wasn't very

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.340 
lot to be desired it just wasn't very
appealing<00:01:15.430> to<00:01:15.820> me<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.600> stuck<00:01:16.900> with<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:17.320> a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
appealing to me so I stuck with it for a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.590 
appealing to me so I stuck with it for a
few<00:01:17.410> lessons<00:01:17.950> but<00:01:18.100> once<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.460> got<00:01:18.580> complex<00:01:19.360> I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
few lessons but once it got complex I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.140 
few lessons but once it got complex I
lost<00:01:20.200> interest<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.860> basically<00:01:21.550> learned<00:01:21.820> a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
lost interest I basically learned a

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.330 
lost interest I basically learned a
couple<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.840> blues<00:01:23.230> riffs<00:01:23.680> enough<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.190> be

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
couple of blues riffs enough to be

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.400 
couple of blues riffs enough to be
impressive<00:01:25.150> as<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.330> kid<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:25.900> every<00:01:26.260> once

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
impressive as a kid and every once

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.960 
impressive as a kid and every once
awhile<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.740> would<00:01:27.100> bring<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.400> out<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.790> kind

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
awhile I would bring it out just to kind

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.700 
awhile I would bring it out just to kind
of<00:01:28.060> hammer<00:01:28.420> out<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.660> melody<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:29.560> my

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
of hammer out a melody that was in my

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.469 
of hammer out a melody that was in my
head<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.610> honest<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.090> probably<00:01:31.360> the

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
head to be honest this is probably the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.940 
head to be honest this is probably the
first<00:01:31.600> time<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.900> pulled<00:01:32.229> this<00:01:32.350> instrument<00:01:32.860> out

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
first time I pulled this instrument out

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.700 
first time I pulled this instrument out
in<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.190> last<00:01:33.400> two<00:01:33.640> years<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:35.170> not<00:01:35.290> something

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
in the last two years it's not something

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.310 
in the last two years it's not something
I<00:01:35.800> play<00:01:36.040> regularly<00:01:36.520> I'm<00:01:37.390> definitely<00:01:37.900> not<00:01:38.020> good

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
I play regularly I'm definitely not good

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.710
