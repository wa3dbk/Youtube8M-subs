 hello everybody talking here about windows 8 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.009
 to the site ms week dot com to the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 geo tv channel on youtube 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.500
 In this video here I'll show you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.210
 how do you enable the advanced menu 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 when we press f8 to 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 boot windows in 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.340
 safety mode with a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 prompt with network then this menu will 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.890
 principle and it is no longer used 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.960
 in windows 8 but it has another one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 way to get there 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 so we can boot this way 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 with f8 and have those advanced options to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.750
 people have come here on the side 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.260
 right in the settings part change 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.930
 computer settings 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 here in the general part 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.960
 here we have advanced startup 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.549
 so starting in this mode is that you 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 you will have the option to start and choose the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.549
 fashion safety mode with 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920
 network 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 so this is where you have this option 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.259
 now there is a way of people 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
