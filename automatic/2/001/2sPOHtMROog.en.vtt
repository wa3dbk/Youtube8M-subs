00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.160
 shitty 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 no no no 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.770
 at that moment when the referee blows 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.360
 at the end of the game and the players 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.920
 direct to the locker room tunnel all 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.450
 minus one and the chosen channel 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.710
 field walk statements that help 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.240
 a reporter to elaborate a 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.830
 superfluous interaction will offer the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.560
 spectator a string of obviedades 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.000
 extra and vice 3-0 have been traced that 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.590
 it has happened but that we have relaxed 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.119
 walks soccer is a sport in which 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.099
 there are obvious statements good we have 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.599
 got 7 has not been good in defense 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.040
 and statements of the lifetime 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.480
 of fulfilling the dream by coming to milan 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.329
 that fulfills a dream coming the inter 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.989
 that fulfills a dream coming here 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.399
 statements and answers that 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.200
 repeat over and over again through the 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.670
 years until assuming the viewer in a 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.170
 emotional state of boredom and boredom as 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.790
 when a journalist asks are 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.230
 certain the rumors that place you in the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.000
 Manchester the next season and the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.830
 player uses the ambiguous and traditional 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 answer I have a contract until June 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.800
 but no doubt there is a star response 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.800
 for these kinds of questions I have 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.060
 informed by the newspapers is 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 true that the juventus has been interested 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.090
 in you I found out from the newspapers of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.890
 This morning it has been seven years 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.329
 playing in the east I found out about 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.759
 the unit newspapers you have two 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.259
 children a boy and a girl not aware of 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.640
 newspapers and what about that of 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.429
 I do not care if he did not win the gold ball 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.560
 the important thing is the team the cojones 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.030
 but if there is one that takes the palm is 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 we have a match on Saturday of our 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.299
 mind is in that match against 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.890
 water sporting digs we will have 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.570
 time to worry about the end of 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.549
 the champions of Tuesday the coaches 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.990
 they are not getting well either now 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.619
 it's time to celebrate it, there's no need to continue 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.930
 working 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.399
 of professional that professional that 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.689
 motivated this absurd prudence has 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.100
 considered the possibility that this 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.330
 prudence the answer exists motivated 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.619
 for the possible adverse reaction that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.270
 could generate more statements 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.409
 sincere however the explanation more 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.820
 accepted is that this kind of 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.259
 statements are side effects 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.530
 of consumption of hallucinogenic mushrooms 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.530
 forest 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.780
 do not 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.780
 place 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.530
 how to hang out before these 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 Forecasts statements there are three 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.060
 options one changes channel two induces 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.220
 your family to domestic violence 3 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600
 this is the moment cleared once by 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.310
 all that doubt that carries within the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.660
 childhood catches the umbrella salt to the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.040
 terrace and finally check if you 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.780
 You can also fly away from home like 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.369
 Mary Poppins may not get it but 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.369
 your neighbor will remember you all his life
