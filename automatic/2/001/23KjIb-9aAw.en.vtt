00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 I am brand pony welcome are boxing 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 pig voice boxing control the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.320
 farm or this control had not used 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.690
 when I went to those who take advantage of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 water and the truth of control is fine 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.270
 59 another word but well and is worth a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.430
 It's worth it then if you have guzmán 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.830
 and only nothing else is a control 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 good if a little brother whatever is the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.670
 moment of force to make a control 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.400
 that is very cool that is obviously 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.380
 edition of a game that is very very very 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.030
 father and good can you seal more to 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 background so that you can see and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 can justify and say you know that at 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.510
 capone control of this horrible planet 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 you know that the capone control is 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 Minci bought it for me and he presents them 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 the knife that makeup would envy this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.440
 Razor is a low has history 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.120
 raze in this razor gave me as 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 the 10 years 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.880
 and all the preserve or I am to fulfill 20 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.620
 years 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.330
 and it 's more rusty good but it's a 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.310
 control boxing of the work ok 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.510
 let's open the control against more or 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.490
 less this is costing a thousand pesos not 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.809
 I say the controls are are pretty 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.600
 expensive and more right now they start 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.900
 the consoles begin to come out this 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.030
 it still gets more more its very or not 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.680
 but good if it is a price a bit 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.350
 high but good I think it's a 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.500
 worthwhile control let's open it 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.260
 it makes so much 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 I believe that now yes you see 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.210
 normal 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.729
 on the street it 's disgusting 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 that is from the box is cool 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.210
 because the box is the normal boxes 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 the xbox consoles and the truth for 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.800
 only they serve is to return them to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.080
 throw but it 's for him because I think that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 it's useful for you so that what 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.979
 you have saved and now you have it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.350
 in the comfort of the comfortable not 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.149
 let's say it like that so it does not happen 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.149
 anything but not remove it carefully 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.950
 ok is it is matte paint ok is 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.619
 paint is paint let's say made for 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.119
 that not so that it does not slip like that because 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.969
 many already there are many controls that you 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.460
 they are painted and the same of painting 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.220
 It makes you slip control is art 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.150
 on hands, poor quality 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.250
 etc 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.860
 This comes with powder paint 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.090
 I think so and well then comes 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.800
 basically the same characteristics 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.200
 of a Uruguayan control but only that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 they bring the image of the big file 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 commemorative I feel one that is the 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380
 arms the significant weapon that is the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.930
 assault rifle they used in the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.209
 game and good everything else is the normal 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.860
 I think it does not bring nothing else will bring 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.550
 guarantee through and those things 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.490
 let's open here ok come consume with 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.560
 Your small user manual 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.590

 clean with your computer well the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 model 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.219

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.709
 secondary character I do not know what it means 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.540

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.060
 product as you see all simple warranty 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.549
 29 product manual and something for you to say 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.349
 there are fingerprints the control is unique and there is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.049
 the good readers or who shares 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.200
 is only in any store 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.389
 video games and the truth is worth it 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.170
 is quite pretty father is a 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.940
 control and I think 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.290
 is going to be iconic of all the millions 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.660
 but I liked it pretty good ye 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.430
 He wants to teach the purchase said good 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.830
 numbers to the appointment to like them 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 who bought things in any store 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.010
 This has no na different from a control 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.050
 normal but who are thinking that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 because his little brother who wants to play or 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.680
 that his dad or I do not know who wants to play 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.150
 with you all friends good then 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.160
 a good option to buy one 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.260
 of these normal cds is if you have a 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.239
 control simón also left the edition 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.680
 from talent off to debut one but 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.849
 good is if you do not have it I think it's 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.519
 a bit hard to get here in 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.160
 mexico but there is the more I think 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.600
 that was medium limited so good to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.220
 recite is what you liked the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.959
