your<00:00:28.529> audio<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.150> end<00:00:30.509> up

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
your audio that way you don't end up

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.530 
your audio that way you don't end up
like<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.050> idiot<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.800> awful<00:00:32.250> sound<00:00:32.540> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
like this idiot with awful sound the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
like this idiot with awful sound the
time<00:00:33.780> lapse<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.170> created<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.649> taking<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> series

time lapse is created by taking a series

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090 
time lapse is created by taking a series
of<00:00:35.460> photos<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> set<00:00:36.630> interval<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.320> that's

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of photos at a set interval time that's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
of photos at a set interval time that's
like<00:00:38.250> taking<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.670> picture<00:00:38.880> every<00:00:39.239> second

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
like taking a picture every second

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
like taking a picture every second
five-second<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.890> 30<00:00:41.250> seconds<00:00:41.700> or<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> minute

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
five-second in 30 seconds or a minute

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
five-second in 30 seconds or a minute
and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.899> playing<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.740> in<00:00:43.980> video<00:00:44.340> real

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and then playing that back in video real

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
and then playing that back in video real
time<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.600> result<00:00:45.990> is<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> time<00:00:46.560> compressed

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
time the result is a time compressed

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
time the result is a time compressed
video<00:00:52.970> so<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.240> I<00:00:54.450> create<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:55.260> time

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
video so the way that I create a time

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.530 
video so the way that I create a time
lapse<00:00:55.710> video<00:00:55.950> is<00:00:56.310> by<00:00:56.460> using<00:00:56.670> magic<00:00:57.120> lantern<00:00:57.420> on

external one that connects to your

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.179 
external one that connects to your
camera<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.000> select<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.240> intervalometer

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
camera I select an intervalometer

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.640 
camera I select an intervalometer
pressing<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> queue<00:01:08.549> button<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.900> then

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
pressing the queue button and then

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399 
pressing the queue button and then
selecting<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:11.460> often<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> photo

every<00:01:14.100> 5<00:01:14.310> seconds<00:01:14.759> 10<00:01:14.939> seconds<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:17.299> now

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
every 5 seconds 10 seconds or what now

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
every 5 seconds 10 seconds or what now
the<00:01:18.420> trick<00:01:18.719> to<00:01:18.749> doing<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.409> night<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.829> each

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the trick to doing this at night is each

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
the trick to doing this at night is each
photo<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.999> be<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.149> long<00:01:21.420> exposure<00:01:21.950> possibly

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
photo will be a long exposure possibly

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.730 
photo will be a long exposure possibly
five<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.520> thirty<00:01:23.729> seconds<00:01:24.179> long<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> second

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
five to thirty seconds long the second

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.529 
five to thirty seconds long the second
trip<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.039> is<00:01:26.189> focusing<00:01:26.789> which<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.420> be

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
trip up is focusing which can be

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.300 
trip up is focusing which can be
difficult<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.649> can't<00:01:28.889> just<00:01:29.100> look

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
difficult because you can't just look

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
difficult because you can't just look
through<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.609> lens<00:01:29.789> and<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.840> focus<00:01:31.200> at

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
through the lens and see to focus at

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
through the lens and see to focus at
night<00:01:31.499> my<00:01:32.340> solution<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.999> to<00:01:33.179> use<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.389> lens<00:01:33.719> which

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
night my solution is to use a lens which

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.480 
night my solution is to use a lens which
has<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> focus<00:01:34.770> distance<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.579> infinity<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
has a focus distance of infinity the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
has a focus distance of infinity the
lens<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.939> use<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.560> astrophotography

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
lens i use for my astrophotography

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.120 
lens i use for my astrophotography
timelapses<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.119> rokinon<00:01:42.840> 14<00:01:43.619> millimeter

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
timelapses is the rokinon 14 millimeter

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.959 
timelapses is the rokinon 14 millimeter
f<00:01:44.399> 2.8<00:01:45.049> manual<00:01:46.049> lens<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:47.100> one's<00:01:47.340> works<00:01:47.579> great

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
f 2.8 manual lens this one's works great

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.120 
f 2.8 manual lens this one's works great
for<00:01:47.999> me<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:49.109> the<00:01:49.259> ability<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> set

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
for me because it has the ability to set

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.749 
for me because it has the ability to set
focus<00:01:50.459> to<00:01:51.270> infinity<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.409> stops<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.249> f<00:01:53.399> 2.8

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
focus to infinity it stops down to f 2.8

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.559 
focus to infinity it stops down to f 2.8
and<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.869> fairly<00:01:55.139> affordable<00:01:56.149> once<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:57.329> dark

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
and is fairly affordable once it's dark

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.899 
and is fairly affordable once it's dark
I<00:01:57.899> set<00:01:58.499> my<00:01:58.649> camera<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> test

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
I set my camera up to take a test

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.480 
I set my camera up to take a test
exposure<00:02:00.619> first<00:02:01.619> thing<00:02:01.889> is<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.069> set<00:02:02.399> your

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
exposure first thing is to set your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.489 
exposure first thing is to set your

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
camera to manual mode and focus your

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.279 
camera to manual mode and focus your
