bit little journey they had any
consistency<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.690> find<00:02:20.960> it<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.140> bit<00:02:21.170> odd

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
consistency and I find it a bit odd

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.710 
consistency and I find it a bit odd
because<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.520> first<00:02:22.910> litter<00:02:23.180> cinnamon<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.690> I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
because the first litter cinnamon that I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.660 
because the first litter cinnamon that I
have<00:02:23.990> gotten<00:02:24.590> doing<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.930> went<00:02:27.230> out<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
have gotten doing that so I went out and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.350 
have gotten doing that so I went out and
I<00:02:28.670> no<00:02:29.570> idea<00:02:29.780> who<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:30.160> mix<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> other<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I no idea who I mix the other one on the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.630 
I no idea who I mix the other one on the
job<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.050> little<00:02:33.530> container<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.430> bought

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
job the little container that I bought

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.850 
job the little container that I bought
separately<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:36.110> thought<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> same

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
separately and I thought the same

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.010 
separately and I thought the same
consequently<00:02:37.670> was<00:02:37.880> more<00:02:38.120> Jaret<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.660> pour<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
consequently was more Jaret I pour it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.949 
consequently was more Jaret I pour it
down<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.200> sink<00:02:39.730> because<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:41.420> didn't<00:02:41.810> really
