 new project that brought them that 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.270
 I have another channel of what would be 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.770

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.320
 upload what would now be videos of 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.000
 minecraft but because the pocket edition 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.470
 then have another channel about what would be 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600
 from time to time something from minecraft 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.579
 pocket edition and well there are enough people 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.829
 who likes what would be quite this 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.930
 theme of minecraft that editing since 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.650
 Well, there are many people who do not have 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.410
 what would be money then the resources 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 to play what would be minecraft of pc 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.700
 since then if you need some resources 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.760
 in the machines to be able to play it 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.650
 overcome the silt and well there are many 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.380
 people preferring to play what 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.780
 would be your minecraft from your phone's 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.000
 your tablet and then it goes much much more 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.710
 more accessible not and well we're going to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.360
 see what this would be the first video in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 This time we'll show you how 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.399
 enter the minecraft servers 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.079
 to be able to play what would be skyworks 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.180
 and to play what would be a bit of 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.680
 the games of hunger 'and well, good 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.820
 right now here from the beginning I 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.590
 I got to what will be the server 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 because then if it costs a little 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.300
 enter the servers and to be 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.010
 playing and all that because what if it costs 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.170
 It would be a bit like you can not see 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.600
 Well now I got myself and I do not know what to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.979
 the hunger games and well this map 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.030
 I had already seen it but in 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.890
 minecraft servers from pc and then yes 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.140
 it was quite epic e mail touched here 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.910
 with one I do not know what happened and so good 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.979
 let's see how you can play in what 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.960
 it would be the servers you do not need to be 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.550
 premium in the minecraft pocket edition 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.680
 to be able to enter the servers neither 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.869
 nothing of that and well let's go out to 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.360
 what would be the main menu here already 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.680
 I have what would be the page where 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.539
 see if they are full what would be the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.920
 servers as you can see then this 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.539
 page will be left in the description 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.759
 of the video so they can enter and 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.250
 visualize how many people are in each 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.899
 on each server and well we're going to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 refresh what would be here the page 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.830
 to see which ones are empty and how 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.810
 you can see then always those of the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.569
 principle always almost always rather 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.430
 they are full 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.079
 and then they have to go here looking for no 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.540
 as you can see then already those up 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.909
 down there are some that if they are a 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.560
 little empty and all that and as you can see 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.930
 because the left side we have what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.510
 would be the servers ip do not go 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.609
 to enter what would be the ip so that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 see how to add what would be a 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.719
 server and as you can see then also 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.180
 says here that it is the servers of 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.099
 survival gain and skyworks as I said 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.500
 and well let's go to what would be the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.909
 micro quickly to teach them 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.980
 how to add what would be a server 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.109
 here still does not start what would be the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.909
 I starting not know why but for magicians 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.370
 we are going to leave as you can see 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.530
 we are in the version of minecraft 10.4 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.419

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.250
 there it is and we are going to add in what 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.699

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.079
 sorry let's give him edit there he is and 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.730
 As you can see, they added us 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.689
 also what would be a new button that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.099
 says external we give tap there is and 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.930
 as you can see then here we can 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.519
 add the servers we are not going to 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.919
 give a new name to what would be 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.450
 this new server we are going to put the 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.230

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.150

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.680
 done and here where andres says we are going to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.810

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.060
 server we will not see what is what 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 it would be right now, there, clear day 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.500

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 again refresh to enter and to 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.280
 update what would be the page 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.800
 let's go to the axis 3 is the one that 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.780
 is there more or less empty there are five 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.120
 people so they can enter let's go to 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.640
 add it we go again to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.830
 Minecraft 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.020
 there it is and we are going to put here what 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.660
 would be in andrÃ©s the ip address of the 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:06.750
 server let's see what ssg sg 3 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:10.920
 point lbs lbs g 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.810
 punto net and we give it in done and in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.430
 the bottom part where it says all over the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.890
 we will leave it as it comes 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.560
 by default and we're just going to give it 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.820
 sorry to add server there is and how 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.800
 you can see, he has already added what 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.650
 it would be like a new map we do not give 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.300
 here tap there is we are going to wait for 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.430
 load what the world would be like 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.500
 it was a normal map of minecraft there 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.780
 it's already loading and right now it's going to 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.940
 look like what the bar would be like 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.200
 is already loading on the map as they can 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.050
 see then all the servers are 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.880
 practically the same as they are therefore 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.010
 the same person only that changes what 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.140
 it would be the ip address but then in 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.630
 reality are the same servers the 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.340
 lobby is the same and well yes friends how 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.310
 can see is quite simple as they 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.040
 he said do not have to be premium users 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.590
 of the minecraft pocket edition since 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.140
 these servers are free until this 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.600
 moment they have not modified it so that 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.340
 enter nothing more premium users than 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.050
 well, that does affect what 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.240
 would users be what it would be 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
