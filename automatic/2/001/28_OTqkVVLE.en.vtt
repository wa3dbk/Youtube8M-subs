00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570

actually<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.530> did<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:07.979> toe-to-toe

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
actually he did very well toe-to-toe
against<00:01:09.060> Povetkin<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> think<00:01:09.869> Povetkin

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
against Povetkin but I think Povetkin

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380 
against Povetkin but I think Povetkin
wasn't<00:01:10.979> any<00:01:11.100> good<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.670> good<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> shape<00:01:11.909> back

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
wasn't any good in as good a shape back

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.219 
wasn't any good in as good a shape back
then<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.840> he's<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.229> he's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
then as he's in now but right now he's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
then as he's in now but right now he's
in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.710> form<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> his<00:01:17.220> career<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.680> Perez<00:01:20.130> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
in the form of his career but my Perez I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
in the form of his career but my Perez I
think<00:01:21.060> there's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.360> slicker<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.979> bit

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
think there's a bit slicker and a bit

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
think there's a bit slicker and a bit
more<00:01:23.369> crafty<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> bit<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.330> talented<00:01:24.810> than

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
more crafty and a bit more talented than

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.710 
more crafty and a bit more talented than
some<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> fighters<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> vet<00:01:27.390> kids<00:01:27.570> been

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
some of the fighters the vet kids been

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
some of the fighters the vet kids been
fighting<00:01:28.020> recently<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> don't<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> as

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
fighting recently so I don't see that as

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.719 
fighting recently so I don't see that as
being<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:30.060> easy<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.540> Povetkin<00:01:31.320> as<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.310> mean<00:01:32.640> not

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
being as easy for Povetkin as I mean not

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
being as easy for Povetkin as I mean not
saying<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> other<00:01:33.150> fights<00:01:33.420> were<00:01:33.540> easy<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
saying the other fights were easy but I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
saying the other fights were easy but I
don't<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.920> Povetkin<00:01:35.460> being<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.759> dominant

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
don't see Povetkin being as dominant

don't see Povetkin being as dominant

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
in itself but if he got past Perez he'd

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.600 
in itself but if he got past Perez he'd
have<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> crack<00:01:58.530> at<00:01:58.560> Deontay<00:01:59.070> Wilder<00:01:59.100> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
i'll probably be in a minority because

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.700 
i'll probably be in a minority because
there<00:02:06.630> seems<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.320> people<00:02:07.469> who

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
there seems to be a lot of people who

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279 
there seems to be a lot of people who
think<00:02:08.539> Povetkin<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.660> wipe<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> floor<00:02:10.259> with
