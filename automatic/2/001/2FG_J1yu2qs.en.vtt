so<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:13.170> stands<00:00:13.680> this<00:00:13.799> bus<00:00:14.100> from<00:00:14.400> vehicles

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
so what stands this bus from vehicles

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.640 
so what stands this bus from vehicles
from<00:00:15.449> all<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:15.809> other<00:00:15.959> ones<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.470> I've

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
from all the other ones that I've

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.650 
from all the other ones that I've
converted<00:00:17.190> into<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.789> electric<00:00:18.179> vehicle<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
converted into an electric vehicle and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
converted into an electric vehicle and
here<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.099> batteries

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
here you can see the batteries

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
here you can see the batteries
I<00:00:20.759> have<00:00:21.689> eventually<00:00:22.589> I'm<00:00:22.679> gonna<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.980> 36

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I have eventually I'm gonna have 36

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.159 
I have eventually I'm gonna have 36
cells<00:00:24.769> for<00:00:25.769> 130<00:00:26.669> volts<00:00:26.999> and<00:00:27.419> this<00:00:27.539> 100<00:00:27.990> amp

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.159 
cells for 130 volts and this 100 amp
batteries<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.999> should<00:00:30.240> give<00:00:30.539> me<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
batteries and that should give me by the

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.990 
batteries and that should give me by the
time<00:00:31.439> I'm<00:00:31.650> done<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.919> want<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.400> have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> hundred

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
time I'm done I want to have a hundred

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
time I'm done I want to have a hundred
mile<00:00:33.329> range<00:00:33.720> on<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.470> might<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> add

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
mile range on this I might have to add

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.540 
mile range on this I might have to add
more<00:00:35.160> battery<00:00:35.520> stick<00:00:35.810> it<00:00:36.810> drives<00:00:37.550> AC

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
more battery stick it drives AC

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.230 
more battery stick it drives AC
induction<00:00:38.910> motor<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> back<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:42.000> cool

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
induction motor in the back and the cool

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.700 
induction motor in the back and the cool
thing<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:42.930> completely

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
thing about this is like completely

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
thing about this is like completely
quiet<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:45.150> has<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.540> of<00:00:45.570> torque<00:00:45.810> it's<00:00:46.440> got

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
quiet it has a lot of torque it's got

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
quiet it has a lot of torque it's got
more<00:00:46.770> torque<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> original<00:00:47.910> motor<00:00:48.330> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
more torque than the original motor that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.380 
more torque than the original motor that
came<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.900> this<00:00:48.990> car<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.970> fun<00:00:51.240> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
came in this car and it's really fun to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
came in this car and it's really fun to
drive<00:00:51.630> and<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.260> serial<00:00:52.830> missions<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
drive and and serial missions so it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.440 
drive and and serial missions so it's
green<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.480> I'm<00:00:54.900> still<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> middle<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.650> it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
green and I'm still in the middle of it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.040 
green and I'm still in the middle of it
it's<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.540> process<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:59.630> plan<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:01.020> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it's a process but I plan to have it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.710 
it's a process but I plan to have it
done<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:02.190> next<00:01:02.430> octave<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:03.240> and<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
done by the next octave here and it

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.630 
done by the next octave here and it
should<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.080> nice<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.409> finished<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> painted

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
should be nice and finished and painted

should be nice and finished and painted
and<00:01:06.149> my<00:01:06.840> plan<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.289> to<00:01:07.439> give<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.999> know<00:01:09.090> test

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and my plan is to give the you know test

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
and my plan is to give the you know test
drive<00:01:09.600> steer<00:01:09.960> everybody<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.499> interested

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
drive steer everybody that's interested

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.330 
drive steer everybody that's interested
in<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.880> electric<00:01:12.710> they're<00:01:13.710> super<00:01:14.130> simple

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in going electric they're super simple

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.160 
in going electric they're super simple
it's<00:01:14.759> basically<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.329> motor<00:01:16.219> and<00:01:17.219> controller

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it's basically a motor and controller

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.569 
it's basically a motor and controller
pack<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> batteries<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
pack of batteries and that's all you

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.950 
pack of batteries and that's all you
have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.819> put<00:01:20.999> in<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.390> super<00:01:21.689> easy<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
have to put in it's super easy to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.800 
have to put in it's super easy to
install<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.560> charger<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.060> charge<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
install a charger you charge the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
install a charger you charge the
batteries<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.920> should<00:01:26.429> be<00:01:26.609> able<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> charge

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
batteries I'm should be able to charge

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
batteries I'm should be able to charge
my<00:01:27.270> batteries<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.319> hours<00:01:28.710> less<00:01:29.399> than<00:01:29.579> two

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
my batteries in two hours less than two

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.770 
my batteries in two hours less than two
hours<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.780> 100<00:01:31.139> miles<00:01:31.319> so<00:01:32.569> that's<00:01:33.569> what

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
hours and go 100 miles so that's what

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.539 
hours and go 100 miles so that's what
allowed<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.469> this<00:01:34.619> cup<00:01:34.889> base<00:01:35.100> feels

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
allowed me to have this cup base feels

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
allowed me to have this cup base feels
like<00:01:35.700> okay<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:37.020> does<00:01:37.259> everything<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.889> want

technology this is actually my first VW

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.899 
technology this is actually my first VW
vehicle<00:01:49.709> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.889> ever<00:01:50.039> bought<00:01:50.189> my<00:01:50.670> brother

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
vehicle that I ever bought my brother

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.410 
vehicle that I ever bought my brother
got<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.719> time<00:01:51.929> 10<00:01:52.350> years<00:01:52.380> ago

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
got into it like but time 10 years ago

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
got into it like but time 10 years ago
and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.810> always<00:01:55.259> wanted<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.679> but<00:01:56.459> it<00:01:56.609> had<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and I always wanted one but it had a lot

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.779 
and I always wanted one but it had a lot
of<00:01:56.939> problems<00:01:57.329> he's<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.749> big<00:01:58.139> go<00:01:58.350> slow

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
of problems he's like big go slow

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.059 
of problems he's like big go slow
they're<00:01:59.789> noisy<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:01.020> leak<00:02:01.229> oil<00:02:01.439> all<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
they're noisy they leak oil all over the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.010 
they're noisy they leak oil all over the
place<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:05.069> I<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.029> I<00:02:06.060> didn't<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:06.600> like
