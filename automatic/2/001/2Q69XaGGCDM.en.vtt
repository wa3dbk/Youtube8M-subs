00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.330 

so<00:00:00.179> interesting<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.079> see<00:00:01.319> what<00:00:01.500> you<00:00:01.650> get<00:00:01.949> and

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so interesting to see what you get and

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.300 
so interesting to see what you get and
when<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.360> did<00:00:03.870> my<00:00:03.929> first<00:00:04.290> cross<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.040> still

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
when I did my first cross I still

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.099 
when I did my first cross I still
remember<00:00:05.460> it<00:00:05.790> was<00:00:06.150> whatever<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.600> hadn't<00:00:06.930> told

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
remember it was whatever I hadn't told

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.129 
remember it was whatever I hadn't told
you<00:00:07.379> know<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.880> guess<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:09.870> probably

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
you know and I guess that's probably

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.749 
you know and I guess that's probably
what<00:00:10.380> most<00:00:10.559> people<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.980> see<00:00:11.280> if<00:00:11.340> we<00:00:11.429> could<00:00:11.460> do

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
what most people to see if we could do

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.419 
what most people to see if we could do
it<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.840> need<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.259> goals<00:00:13.650> when

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
it but you need to have goals when

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.960 
it but you need to have goals when
you're<00:00:14.610> hybridizing<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.520> you<00:00:17.520> might<00:00:17.730> get

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
you're hybridizing and you might get

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
you're hybridizing and you might get
lucky<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> cause<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
lucky if you just do that cause of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.710 
lucky if you just do that cause of
anything<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.630> something<00:00:22.140> that's<00:00:22.289> nice

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
anything and get something that's nice

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.200 
anything and get something that's nice
but<00:00:24.720> chances<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.880> pay

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
but chances are of you if you pay

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
but chances are of you if you pay
attention<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.410> goals<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:29.189> you'll

right here came from the same seedling

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.779 
right here came from the same seedling
and<00:01:44.209> look<00:01:44.840> how<00:01:45.289> isn't<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.920> interesting<00:01:46.579> how

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
and look how isn't that interesting how

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.850 
and look how isn't that interesting how
you<00:01:46.849> can<00:01:47.270> get<00:01:48.129> some<00:01:49.129> that<00:01:49.429> are<00:01:50.349> different<00:01:51.349> this

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
you can get some that are different this

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.699 
you can get some that are different this
was<00:01:52.399> Gators<00:01:52.909> tail<00:01:53.239> and<00:01:53.569> little<00:01:53.869> tequila<00:01:54.020> bill

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
was Gators tail and little tequila bill

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.279 
was Gators tail and little tequila bill
tequila<00:01:55.280> little<00:01:55.939> tequila<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.629> similar<00:01:57.110> to

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
tequila little tequila is similar to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.020 
tequila little tequila is similar to
this<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:57.709> it<00:01:57.829> doesn't<00:01:58.129> have<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.280> lines<00:01:58.640> in

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
this but it doesn't have the lines in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.169 
this but it doesn't have the lines in
there<00:01:59.239> and<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:01.009> one<00:02:01.340> everybody<00:02:01.939> probably

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
there and this one everybody probably

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.080 
there and this one everybody probably
knows<00:02:02.390> one<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.079> parents<00:02:03.500> was<00:02:04.069> Sylvia<00:02:04.520> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
knows one of the parents was Sylvia and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.440 
knows one of the parents was Sylvia and
the<00:02:06.020> other<00:02:06.170> one<00:02:06.439> was<00:02:06.649> Emily<00:02:07.250> which<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.179> this

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the other one was Emily which is this

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.539 
the other one was Emily which is this
and<00:02:10.510> what<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.540> noticed<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.040> purple<00:02:13.400> is

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
and what I noticed is that the purple is

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.970 
and what I noticed is that the purple is
lighter<00:02:13.849> on<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> first

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
lighter on this one this is the first

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.129 
lighter on this one this is the first

have to grow out the plants for a while
and<00:02:59.310> see<00:02:59.520> how<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.730> public<00:02:59.970> does<00:03:01.910> another

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and see how the public does another

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.540 
and see how the public does another
thing<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.330> some<00:03:03.540> people<00:03:03.870> do<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.320> grow<00:03:05.250> for

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
thing that some people do is grow for

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.690 
thing that some people do is grow for
shorter<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.150> taller<00:03:06.420> stems<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:08.010> crystal<00:03:08.550> i

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
shorter or taller stems like crystal i

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.730 
shorter or taller stems like crystal i
remember<00:03:09.150> once<00:03:09.600> when<00:03:09.780> he<00:03:09.840> said<00:03:10.170> he<00:03:10.320> likes<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
remember once when he said he likes the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.590 
remember once when he said he likes the
shorter<00:03:11.100> stents<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.700> probably<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.390> good

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
shorter stents and probably it is a good

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.420 
shorter stents and probably it is a good
idea<00:03:12.690> maybe<00:03:13.140> four<00:03:13.500> packages<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:15.240> stuff<00:03:15.410> so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
idea maybe four packages and stuff so
