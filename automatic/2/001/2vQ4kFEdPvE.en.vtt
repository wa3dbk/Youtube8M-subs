good<00:02:24.320> one<00:02:25.320> trick<00:02:26.240> we<00:02:27.240> can<00:02:27.360> get<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
good one trick we can get in here is to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.340 
good one trick we can get in here is to
cut<00:02:29.460> these<00:02:29.610> bolts<00:02:29.940> off<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.810> anybody<00:02:31.290> has

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
cut these bolts off and if anybody has

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.040 
cut these bolts off and if anybody has
to<00:02:31.500> cut<00:02:31.620> some<00:02:31.800> bolts<00:02:32.040> off<00:02:32.570> put<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> nut<00:02:33.870> down

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
to cut some bolts off put the nut down

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.290 
to cut some bolts off put the nut down
on<00:02:34.290> first<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.890> when<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.490> nut<00:02:35.640> off<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
on first so when you back the nut off it

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.920 
on first so when you back the nut off it

I use the nut and have it pull through a
round<00:03:43.920> hole<00:03:44.130> helps<00:03:44.670> lock<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.360> if<00:03:45.810> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
round hole helps lock that in if I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.170 
round hole helps lock that in if I
needed<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.350> could<00:03:46.610> tack<00:03:47.610> weld<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.090> I

wheel well it's gonna be rubbing on a
few<00:04:00.120> bolts<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.720> I've<00:04:01.320> got<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> few<00:04:01.800> right<00:04:01.950> here

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
few bolts and I've got a few right here

and<00:04:02.310> those<00:04:02.459> are<00:04:02.640> coming<00:04:02.790> out<00:04:03.080> cuz<00:04:04.080> that's

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
and those are coming out cuz that's

they're putting everything together I'm
actually<00:04:09.930> using<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.410> little<00:04:10.590> dielectric

grease on everything dielectric grease

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.190 
grease on everything dielectric grease
is<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.030> grease<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.299> will<00:04:15.690> transfer

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
is a grease that will transfer

is a grease that will transfer
electricity<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.430> use<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.209> all<00:04:18.570> electric

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
electricity I use it on all electric

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.539 
electricity I use it on all electric
connections<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.620> helps<00:04:19.799> force<00:04:20.070> water<00:04:20.310> out

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
connections it helps force water out

connections it helps force water out
keeps<00:04:20.850> corrosion<00:04:21.359> down<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:23.000> works<00:04:24.000> really

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
keeps corrosion down and works really

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.570

well

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.649 

you<00:04:27.580> can<00:04:27.699> see<00:04:27.819> the<00:04:27.939> reason<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.240> don't<00:04:28.300> really

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
you can see the reason I don't really

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.730 
you can see the reason I don't really
like<00:04:28.870> having<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:30.539> mental<00:04:31.539> hold<00:04:32.169> down<00:04:32.379> strap

and over here I had a project where I

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.330 
and over here I had a project where I
was<00:05:33.159> you<00:05:33.819> know<00:05:33.879> welding<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.830> grinding<00:05:35.830> and
