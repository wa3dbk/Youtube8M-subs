00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
little bit so you guys might know it's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.760 
little bit so you guys might know it's
really<00:00:34.980> cheap<00:00:35.300> well<00:00:36.300> considering<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.290> most

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
really cheap well considering what most

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.670 
really cheap well considering what most
you<00:00:37.980> guys<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:38.940> cheap<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.420> guess

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
for me it's kind of expensive but yes so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
for me it's kind of expensive but yes so

here we go guys basically the only
things<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.520> different<00:00:47.670> about

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
things that are really different about

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.370 
things that are really different about
the<00:00:48.390> computer<00:00:48.750> besides<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.980> corsair<00:00:50.670> h50<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
the computer besides the corsair h50 is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.400

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
their Getty nine anytime I enable the

their Getty nine anytime I enable the
manual<00:01:23.160> overclock<00:01:23.610> settings<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:25.320> just

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
manual overclock settings and it just

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
manual overclock settings and it just
restarts<00:01:26.010> three<00:01:26.190> times<00:01:26.430> goes<00:01:26.820> back<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
restarts three times goes back to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.360 
restarts three times goes back to
default<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.800> that<00:01:28.830> there<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
default and that's all that there is to

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.630 
default and that's all that there is to
it<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.020> I'm<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> guess<00:01:31.860> reflash

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it so I'm gonna have to I guess reflash

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
it so I'm gonna have to I guess reflash

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
border you got to flash the bios it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.540 
border you got to flash the bios it's
not<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.930> an<00:01:46.080> asus<00:01:46.500> where<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
not like an asus where it's all you know

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.340 
not like an asus where it's all you know
built-in<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.600> anywhere<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
built-in you can go anywhere to get the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.320 
built-in you can go anywhere to get the
biases<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:49.890> most<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.550> biases<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> are

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
biases like most of the biases that are

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.940 
biases like most of the biases that are
made<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:51.780> board<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.530> custom

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
made for this board are actually custom

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.640 
made for this board are actually custom
so<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:54.090> least<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.690> read<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.290> mean<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
so at least that's what I read I mean I

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.500 
so at least that's what I read I mean I
might<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.130> wrong<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.210> anybody

might be wrong so you know if anybody
has<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.810> board<00:01:58.080> once<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.410> help<00:01:58.530> me<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:59.150> you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150

again the reason for this is just to
protect<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> case<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.569> know<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:10.080> reason

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
protect in case you know some reason

anything<00:02:10.679> were<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:12.780> over<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
anything were to get over there and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.120 
anything were to get over there and
you<00:02:15.630> guys<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.020> my<00:02:16.140> temperatures<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.710> nice<00:02:16.860> I'm

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
you guys so my temperatures are nice I'm

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.090 
you guys so my temperatures are nice I'm
actually<00:02:17.310> running<00:02:17.580> at<00:02:17.790> stock<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:19.100> yes

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
actually running at stock right now yes

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.050

I<00:02:20.250> could<00:02:20.370> probably<00:02:20.580> show<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.940> guys

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I could probably show you guys

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890

see<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> temperatures<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:53.650> when<00:02:53.890> I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
see the temperatures and actually when I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.010 
see the temperatures and actually when I
started<00:02:54.430> up<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.970> was<00:02:56.130> 28<00:02:57.130> c<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.780> that's<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
started up it was 28 c so that's the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.320 
started up it was 28 c so that's the
lowest<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.500> been<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.920> far<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.610> that's<00:03:01.120> great

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
lowest it's been so far so that's great

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.990 
lowest it's been so far so that's great
of<00:03:01.630> course<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:01.989> room<00:03:02.230> was<00:03:02.640> 68<00:03:03.640> degrees

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
of course my room was 68 degrees

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.860 
of course my room was 68 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:04.569> now<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:04.959> up<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.110> about<00:03:05.320> 72<00:03:06.870> so

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
Fahrenheit now it's up to about 72 so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.330 
Fahrenheit now it's up to about 72 so
man<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> temperatures<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.739> great<00:03:09.010> i<00:03:09.040> love

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
man the temperatures are great i love

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.979 
man the temperatures are great i love
how<00:03:09.550> they<00:03:09.670> don't<00:03:09.850> really<00:03:10.150> they<00:03:10.480> don't<00:03:10.510> spike

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
how they don't really they don't spike

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.110 
how they don't really they don't spike

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
like they used to like with the air

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.170 
like they used to like with the air

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
loading just spiked the temperatures

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
loading just spiked the temperatures
whereas<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.840> takes<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.260> few<00:03:20.470> seconds

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
whereas this it takes a few seconds

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.670 
whereas this it takes a few seconds
before<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.550> really<00:03:22.540> starts<00:03:23.140> loading<00:03:23.380> up<00:03:23.590> the

i<00:03:29.170> first<00:03:29.380> started<00:03:29.709> up<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> highest<00:03:30.459> it

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
i first started up and the highest it

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.140 
i first started up and the highest it
got<00:03:30.700> was<00:03:30.910> 42<00:03:31.390> c<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.370> even<00:03:33.730> fully

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
got was 42 c so and even fully

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.690 
got was 42 c so and even fully
overclocked<00:03:34.660> at<00:03:34.840> 3.2<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.860> maybe<00:03:36.280> would<00:03:36.580> have

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
overclocked at 3.2 it maybe would have

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.080 
overclocked at 3.2 it maybe would have
been<00:03:36.820> 50<00:03:37.360> at<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:38.530> most<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.130> that's<00:03:39.549> two<00:03:39.940> or

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
been 50 at the most and that's two or

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.930 
been 50 at the most and that's two or
three<00:03:40.299> notches<00:03:40.510> up<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.079> voltage<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.700> yeah

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
three notches up on the voltage so yeah

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.380 
three notches up on the voltage so yeah
guys<00:03:43.090> that's<00:03:43.150> about<00:03:43.630> it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
guys that's about it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.010 
guys that's about it
that's<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.630> computer<00:03:47.490> nothing<00:03:48.490> much<00:03:49.020> that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
that's the computer nothing much that

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.710
