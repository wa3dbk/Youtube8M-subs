gonna<00:02:28.959> start<00:02:29.260> noticing<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.890> bad<00:02:30.099> things

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
gonna start noticing the bad things

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.309 
gonna start noticing the bad things
about<00:02:31.209> this<00:02:31.540> controller<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:33.220> feels<00:02:33.640> weird

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
about this controller it feels weird

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.839 
about this controller it feels weird
right<00:02:35.319> off<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> get-go<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.510> triggers<00:02:38.849> it

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
right off the get-go the triggers it

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.059 
right off the get-go the triggers it
almost<00:02:40.450> means<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.410> kind<00:02:41.920> of

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
almost means you have to like kind of

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.740 
almost means you have to like kind of
bend<00:02:42.370> your<00:02:42.549> finger<00:02:42.879> like<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.420> hit<00:02:43.540> them

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
bend your finger like this to hit them

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
bend your finger like this to hit them
which<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.799> weird<00:02:45.040> because<00:02:45.160> if<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.489> hold<00:02:45.670> it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
which is weird because if you hold it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640 
which is weird because if you hold it
like<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:45.879> no<00:02:46.690> one<00:02:46.900> does<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.379> know<00:02:47.500> you're

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
like this no one does you know you're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like this no one does you know you're
not<00:02:47.739> gonna<00:02:47.890> be<00:02:47.980> able<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> hit<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.640> your

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
not gonna be able to hit it with your

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.589 
not gonna be able to hit it with your
knuckles<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:51.209> don't<00:02:52.209> know<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.390> have<00:02:52.480> to

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
knuckles so I don't know you have to

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.740 
knuckles so I don't know you have to
bend<00:02:52.750> your<00:02:52.930> fingers<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.319> hit<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.620> these<00:02:54.750> the

R and the L button up top actually

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.199 
R and the L button up top actually
almost<00:02:58.450> get<00:02:59.079> in<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.470> way<00:02:59.709> of<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.640> because

you'll click them sometimes the buttons
themselves<00:03:05.590> are<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:07.349> clunky<00:03:09.060> see<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:11.849> yeah

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
themselves are very clunky see that yeah

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:13.680 
themselves are very clunky see that yeah
they're<00:03:13.209> just

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
they're just

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.839 
they're just
especially<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> X<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.859> y<00:03:15.010> button<00:03:15.310> very

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
clunky here it almost feels like it's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.409 
clunky here it almost feels like it's
made<00:03:19.750> by<00:03:19.959> like<00:03:20.440> an<00:03:20.680> off-brand<00:03:21.579> but<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.209> isn't

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
block button that is of course if you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.050 
block button that is of course if you
change<00:05:04.420> it<00:05:04.630> in<00:05:04.840> these<00:05:05.680> settings<00:05:06.220> because<00:05:06.430> deep

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
change it in these settings because deep

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.940 
change it in these settings because deep
by<00:05:07.240> default<00:05:07.690> this<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.380> block<00:05:08.590> buttons

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
by default this is the block buttons

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.520 
by default this is the block buttons
these<00:05:09.100> two<00:05:09.370> bumpers<00:05:10.360> here<00:05:10.630> which<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:11.020> weird

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
these two bumpers here which is weird

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.250 
these two bumpers here which is weird
enough<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.760> mean<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.300> don't<00:05:13.720> know<00:05:13.930> you

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
enough you I mean I don't know you

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.600 
enough you I mean I don't know you
wouldn't<00:05:14.500> play<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:14.890> that<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.250> jumps

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
wouldn't play it like that the jumps

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.640 
wouldn't play it like that the jumps
like<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.090> said<00:05:19.300> buttons<00:05:19.780> are<00:05:19.870> really<00:05:19.960> clunky<00:05:20.320> so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
like I said buttons are really clunky so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.420 
like I said buttons are really clunky so
for<00:05:20.830> Smash<00:05:21.100> Bros<00:05:21.690> it's<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.870> definite<00:05:23.380> no-go<00:05:24.160> for

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
for Smash Bros it's a definite no-go for

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.470 
for Smash Bros it's a definite no-go for
me<00:05:24.760> I<00:05:24.970> just<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.750> couldn't<00:05:26.260> do<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.880> but<00:05:27.880> I<00:05:28.120> fired

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
me I just I couldn't do it but I fired

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.680 
me I just I couldn't do it but I fired
up<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.750> game<00:05:28.960> like<00:05:29.770> Mario<00:05:30.160> Kart<00:05:30.220> 8<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.300> played

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
up a game like Mario Kart 8 I played

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.430 
up a game like Mario Kart 8 I played
Mario<00:05:31.990> Kart<00:05:32.230> 8<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:32.610> enjoyed<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:34.720> was<00:05:34.750> you

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
Mario Kart 8 and enjoyed it it was you

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440 
Mario Kart 8 and enjoyed it it was you
know<00:05:35.560> it's<00:05:35.980> it's<00:05:36.340> Mario<00:05:36.670> Kart<00:05:36.940> so<00:05:37.120> basically

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
know it's it's Mario Kart so basically

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.240 
know it's it's Mario Kart so basically
all<00:05:37.570> you<00:05:37.750> need<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.990> do<00:05:38.170> is<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.410> hit<00:05:38.680> gas<00:05:38.920> and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
all you need to do is a hit gas and

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.360 
all you need to do is a hit gas and
steer<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.780> played<00:05:40.780> great<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:43.090> but<00:05:44.080> it's<00:05:44.380> just

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
steer it played great but but it's just

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.080 
steer it played great but but it's just
as<00:05:45.610> satisfying<00:05:46.180> on<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.990> pro<00:05:47.530> controller<00:05:47.980> or<00:05:48.880> any

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
as satisfying on a pro controller or any

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.570 
as satisfying on a pro controller or any
other<00:05:49.300> controller<00:05:49.840> this<00:05:50.470> is<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:51.220> know<00:05:51.340> say

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
other controller this is you know say

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.230 
other controller this is you know say
the<00:05:51.760> least<00:05:51.910> it's<00:05:52.620> almost<00:05:53.620> more<00:05:54.400> satisfying<00:05:55.000> on

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
the least it's almost more satisfying on

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.560 
the least it's almost more satisfying on
other<00:05:55.450> controllers<00:05:56.460> so<00:05:57.460> basically<00:05:57.970> my<00:05:58.180> review

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
other controllers so basically my review

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.470 
other controllers so basically my review
for<00:05:58.780> this<00:05:58.870> controller<00:05:59.350> is<00:05:59.760> quite<00:06:00.760> negative<00:06:01.270> as

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
for this controller is quite negative as

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480 
for this controller is quite negative as
if<00:06:01.780> you<00:06:01.960> could<00:06:02.140> not<00:06:02.350> already<00:06:02.770> tell

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
if you could not already tell

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.990 
if you could not already tell
it<00:06:03.850> is<00:06:04.570> quite<00:06:04.840> negative<00:06:05.280> not<00:06:06.280> too<00:06:06.520> happy<00:06:06.730> with

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
it is quite negative not too happy with

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.960 
it is quite negative not too happy with
the<00:06:07.150> gameplay<00:06:07.720> of<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:08.080> or<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.040> way<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.880> know

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970

the gameplay of it or the way you know
with<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.360> way<00:06:10.480> it<00:06:10.540> plays<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.050> way<00:06:11.170> it<00:06:11.230> feels

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
with the way it plays the way it feels

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.160 
with the way it plays the way it feels

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
it's weird and awkward but it will make
