00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.100
 four people injured and 131 years of working in a school 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.410
 if they would divide the money the same how much each person will receive 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.079
 this problem 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.159
 resolved by dividing between â‚¬ 81 per four people 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.760
 to find out how much you will know that depression 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
 so our expression etc 180 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.919
 I lived alive 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.019
 for 4 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.579
 and how does he but we do not see if you try to impose on us 4 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 let's use 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.490
 an algorithm 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.640
 what is the sesc 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.370
 we have this money how many times cabul 4 within 180 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 she always hopes to stay 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.860
 our calculations 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.210
 What can we do for deliveries? 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.730
 first we see 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 the 4 carla some ways inside this organism 1 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.030
 the first is one of them 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.109
 If you do not understand, let's go. 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030
 vera current leader of the right wing although we say will be 4 horses a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.119
 once inside the desert issing riding example 18 why 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.480
 little of the 8 is the largest in the country 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.350
 then how many times and Kabul the picture inside the desert well 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.240
 we will be that 4 times of one this is very important to know the exact guard 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 four times and a collar 4 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.180
 and four times two 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.950
 is equal to 8 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.160
 we will also be four times three 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.150
 is equal to 12 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.140
 we noticed that 4-4 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.450
 is equal to 16 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.880
 and 4 9 5 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 is equal to 20 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 so we could review the nearest number 18 is the 16 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.620
 so we will use the 4x4 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.150
 4 of these 4 because at 16 we wrote about the Eight uses heat that the train 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.420
 the famous 18-state disasters are two 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.009
 and now is to use 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.009
 downloaded zero why 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.919
 there is no left 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.789
 He hesitated in question and we are now with 20 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.739
 and now we come back to ask the question how many times chip 4 inside the end 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:37.339
 in the text the mock two twins that 4 times five equal to 20 so 5 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.379
 times 4 is also equal to 20 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.989
 and 20-25 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.719
 is equal to zero 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.199
 both our rest of us 0 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.769
 so he gave us a perfect view 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.129
 if four people have done so and others for working in a school if 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.809
 they gave you just as much as each bryant person will be 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.169
 one hundred and eighty and I've already lived for four people perkins treatment 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.659
 koren the note hi-5 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.709
 and so every European person 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.449
 you will receive it 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.089
 orient 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:13.219
 in five 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:13.739
