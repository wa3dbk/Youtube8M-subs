00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.069 
something to it for ages that it enjoys
like<00:03:06.700> stroking<00:03:07.060> its<00:03:07.299> battles<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:07.780> again<00:03:07.989> it

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
like stroking its battles on again it

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.630 
like stroking its battles on again it
doesn't<00:03:08.260> change<00:03:08.769> its<00:03:09.010> personality<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:12.040> Hasbro

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
doesn't change its personality so Hasbro

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.000 
doesn't change its personality so Hasbro
seems<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.180> change<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.630> little<00:03:13.780> bit<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.319> it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
seems to change a little bit here it

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:37.849 
seems to change a little bit here it
makes<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.310> more<00:03:15.430> interesting<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:16.030> suppose

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:49.220 

so<00:03:38.859> far<00:03:39.159> I<00:03:39.189> found<00:03:39.519> four<00:03:39.790> personalities<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:47.400> I

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
so far I found four personalities and I

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.280 
so far I found four personalities and I
think<00:03:50.230> there's<00:03:50.409> another<00:03:50.620> one<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.980> find
