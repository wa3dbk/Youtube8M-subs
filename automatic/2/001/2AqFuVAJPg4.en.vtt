want to do is you go down and it'll say

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.339 
want to do is you go down and it'll say

disconnect wireless if you're running an

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.709 
disconnect wireless if you're running an
Ethernet<00:00:31.740> cable<00:00:32.180> basically<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.420> easier

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
Ethernet cable basically it's easier

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.090 
Ethernet cable basically it's easier
than<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> pull<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
than that you just have to pull the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
than that you just have to pull the
cable<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.579> from<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> Xbox<00:00:37.230> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
cable out from the back of the Xbox and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
cable out from the back of the Xbox and
that<00:00:38.129> should<00:00:38.370> disconnect<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that should disconnect you from the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.819 
that should disconnect you from the
Internet<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> reason<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:40.469> doing<00:00:40.590> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
Internet now the reason we're doing this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
Internet now the reason we're doing this
is<00:00:40.980> we're<00:00:41.579> gonna<00:00:41.700> install<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> game<00:00:42.800> offline

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
is we're gonna install the game offline

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.590 
is we're gonna install the game offline
now<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> find<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.700> easier<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> don't

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now I find that easier because you don't

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.850 
now I find that easier because you don't
get<00:00:45.690> stuck<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> queues<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.649> you're<00:00:46.770> not

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
get stuck in queues and you're not

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
get stuck in queues and you're not
sitting<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.340> forever<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:48.000> still<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.840> still

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sitting there forever it still it still

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
sitting there forever it still it still
takes<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.680> bit<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> time<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> find

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
takes a little bit of time but I find

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
takes a little bit of time but I find
it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.719> quicker<00:00:51.930> than<00:00:52.199> trying<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it's a little bit quicker than trying to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.810 
it's a little bit quicker than trying to
do<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> online<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.370> you're<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.520> sitting

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
do it online and you're not sitting

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.939 
do it online and you're not sitting
there<00:00:54.059> forever<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.570> queues<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> want

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there forever in queues so what you want

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.439 
there forever in queues so what you want
to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.430> we're<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> insert<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.210> disc

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to do is we're going to insert a disc

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
to do is we're going to insert a disc
for<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> purpose<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.070> video<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.730> just

using call of duty ghosts' I haven't
installed<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.670> xbox<00:01:02.940> yet<00:01:03.270> I've<00:01:03.359> had<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
installed it on my xbox yet I've had it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
installed it on my xbox yet I've had it
for<00:01:03.719> ages<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.470> played<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.949> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
for ages but I have not played it so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
for ages but I have not played it so
you're<00:01:05.970> gonna<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.420> disc<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> then

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you're gonna put your disc in and then

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.649 
you're gonna put your disc in and then
basically<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.280> gonna<00:01:08.369> start<00:01:08.729> installing<00:01:09.330> as

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
basically it's gonna start installing as

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.020 
basically it's gonna start installing as
it<00:01:09.780> normally<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.820> from<00:01:11.820> there

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it normally would and go from there

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
it normally would and go from there
because<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.470> stuck<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
because it's not going to get stuck in

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
because it's not going to get stuck in
queues<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.790> anything<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
queues or anything like that so as you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.749 
queues or anything like that so as you
can<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.340> games<00:01:17.580> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
can see you're going to your games and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
apps will bump it back up to games and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
apps will bump it back up to games and
there<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.720> says<00:01:21.930> there

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there you go you can see it says there

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620

it is installing so basically now it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
it is installing so basically now it's
just<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.900> waiting<00:01:25.110> game<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.430> game<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
just a waiting game for the game to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
just a waiting game for the game to
install<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.750> sit<00:01:28.320> back<00:01:28.560> relax<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:29.220> something

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
else for about the next and I think it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
else for about the next and I think it
took<00:01:32.159> me<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.369> 20<00:01:33.210> minutes<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.600> something

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
took me about 20 minutes or something

when<00:02:10.500> you're<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.860> play<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> game

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
when you're going to play the game

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.869 
when you're going to play the game
there's<00:02:12.030> two<00:02:12.239> things<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.660> will<00:02:12.780> happen

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
there's two things that will happen

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.509 
there's two things that will happen
it'll<00:02:14.450> sink<00:02:14.750> which<00:02:15.319> means<00:02:15.590> I'm<00:02:16.160> not<00:02:16.340> actually

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
it'll sink which means I'm not actually

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.860 
it'll sink which means I'm not actually
sure<00:02:16.760> what<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.180> means<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.480> think<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.750> just

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
sure what it means I think it's just

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.740 
sure what it means I think it's just
kind<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.200> lining<00:02:18.410> up<00:02:18.620> making<00:02:18.860> sure<00:02:19.390> data<00:02:20.390> or

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
kind of lining up making sure data or

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.930 
kind of lining up making sure data or
just<00:02:21.260> save<00:02:21.530> stuff<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.160> there<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:22.790> you've

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
just save stuff is there if you've

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.820 
just save stuff is there if you've
played<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.269> before<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:24.080> here's<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.410> main<00:02:24.590> one

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
played it before but here's the main one

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.160 
played it before but here's the main one
Call<00:02:25.129> of<00:02:25.160> Duty<00:02:25.519> ghosts<00:02:26.030> needs<00:02:26.330> an<00:02:26.540> update<00:02:26.930> and

Call of Duty ghosts needs an update and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.869 
Call of Duty ghosts needs an update and
this<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.769> reason<00:02:28.069> why<00:02:28.160> we're<00:02:28.340> back<00:02:28.489> online

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
this is the reason why we're back online

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.400 
this is the reason why we're back online
we<00:02:29.060> can't<00:02:29.300> pull<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.569> from<00:02:29.690> anywhere<00:02:29.989> else<00:02:30.200> this

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
we can't pull it from anywhere else this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.530 
we can't pull it from anywhere else this
has<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.830> be<00:02:30.920> done<00:02:31.010> online<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.670> basically

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540
