00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 hi to all these koffi leagues and 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.920
 today I am going to speak to you about 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 light maintenance of the guitar so by 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.240
 the jets I enter I talk about an interview 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.849
 from day to day what will you allow 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.940
 to simply avoid on the long 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.340
 term as your varnish or your wood 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
 salim and especially to preserve the strings 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 for a long time so that's enough 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.170
 to just have items are not very 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 expensive 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.770
 a share we little one month you can 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.540
 find in a radius arranged for 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 a few euros and on the other hand to a tube 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.989
 of fast food where we bring it 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.750
 any final sprint run 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.280
 so that's why already a little 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.690
 at home just look in 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.530
 always one in your study in your 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.910
 box when you 're done playing 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.379
 is that you let a few 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.180
 traces on the body of the guitar 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.640
 by the arm and that's what it takes 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.289
 know to polish by the trust that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.570
 has chickweed is simply 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.309
 the acidity of sweat and simply 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.300
 the natural acidity expected in Pau 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.360
 also let go to Aix so all 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.210
 simply asked nic biever girl to have 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 found the sweet side 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.640
 chamois skin side and then 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.260
 slightly any listener mainly 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 where you go is the big 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.970
 our brave so radiation must 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 know that on the matte varnish you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.900
 this year as all habitat is worth 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.509
 better not to rub very hard otherwise it 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.490
 14h risk in place here do not hesitate 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.780
 also to hit clubs 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.580
 Serbians and all the sweating that has 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610
 su and you can also pass 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.000
 behind the strings passing so the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.220
 cloth behind and that will pass there 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100
 minus a sure hit the innings so then 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.300
 what is basketball 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 just it's a little make it a 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.310
 place of tricks that has a naive strand and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.940
 if like that already used the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.560
 renew it will just put 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.970
 a layer on the ropes that goes them 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.810
 settle without so if you do not have 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.550
 jump on slippery 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.560
 to spend a little bit of cloth especially 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.400
 provided with that will take away the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.069
 salty product then it's actually okay 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.069
 remove the rope to avoid any 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.230
 aggressive contact so with the flower or 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.209
 rabbits are not in danger 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.610
 do not hesitate to iron a little 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.270
 less daring come play like that and you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.940
 would be clean 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.120
 so that's it for a few kids 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.640
 euros it will allow you a lot of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.110
 of savings at the level between tiny especially 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.820
 new change of strings game for 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.370
 give a little example and a time where 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.450
 I was not paying much attention to that and that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.340
 I happened to snap the strings 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.250
 easily with each repetition or each 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 blow this and since I do these little ones 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.019
 daily gestures down my hard strings 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.850
 five to six times longer we are going 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 say so here after for people 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.910
 who are always afraid of decor that 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.739
 do not last very long and who have 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.209
 patrolled the maintenenions would exist 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.410
 also also strings directly 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.569
 treaty which are the courts of elections 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.430
 but which costs a lot more 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.420
 So here you have questions 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.269
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.989
 comments and otherwise enjoy yourself well 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.989
 musically
