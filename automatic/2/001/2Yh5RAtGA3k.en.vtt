00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:02.879
 Talk is everybody. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.019
 2 comments recently said none 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.100
 huh 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.270
 so no one in any other disease 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 What do you do 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 so it 's first of all going after a 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.799
 professional a designer of a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 advertising agency advertising agency 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.530
 if you have money to invest in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.630
 born the machine is is on the mat is the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 company name is not your name 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.759
 simply the company 's business so 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.009
 one more affection for this goes behind 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.720
 of professionals to do this will not 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.900
 give because it forces them to rise to VW 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.150
 do not run and do a legal deal 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.060
 Because he is not a designer, he has not studied. 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.939
 he may have mastered the tool is not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.799
 the same thing you get a tello that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.399
 to take his hand he knows I do not 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.229
 I know how it is there it will keep there world. 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.240
 go after a professional will not end 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 doing as peg put by the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.979
 selective camera makes a deal 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.350
 different that has to do with the segments 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.340
 you do though is a business that has the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.940
 do with it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.160
 has elements in your logo that has to do with 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.840
 one hundred meters you make the same wedding 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.050
 thing then try to make a deal that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.280
 have an identity with you and with 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.560
 what do you do 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.260
 besides you take care is with all 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.450
 that this visual identity application 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 of its extremely important long 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.670
 what else we on the internet is 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.910
 photography and the logo practically occupying 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.550
 half of the photograph or in the middle then the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.440
 application of it is extremely important 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 try not to make a logo is too 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.460
 not too colorful for her either 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.830
 draw much applied attention from a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.030
 more discreet form if possible with a 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 transparency 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.700
 really the photographs and colonized right 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 not only is it only what is important is your 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.880
 photo not always your photo will dominate 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.530
 all space beyond foxconn 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.730
 then the sample is playing up 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 Intermediate people assay everyone 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.590
 participated in the photo wolf and in the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.770
 case of him who takes photos and only goes to a 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 motel that I soon became the makeup artist for 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.640
 store designer from far away and listen 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.880
 a carnival in a little while back on earth 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.209
 of the model which announces that they 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:30.140
 long is the last case the most 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.690
 important is the photograph of her comforted 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:41.330
 so let's go the main theme of the video 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:45.590
 which is soon to use or not to use but see with 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:49.850
 attendance rate paid with a test 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.540
 a book and then receive a DVD with all 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.540
 the signed photos 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.610
 You sold your picture. 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.100
 Watching her clean, you're going to publish the fan. 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.130
 page alright, you signed 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:08.060
 but if you are delivering the customer 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:12.860
 I do not do not want you to put 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.850
 in the contract the customer will put the 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.850
 signed contract 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.580
 when any application is published 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.969
 in the photo you oblige your client to 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.889
 put in the picture the photo by so and so 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:30.680
 makeup and now for the credits 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.090
 in the photo not on top of the photo pollute photos 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.629
 not professional 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.460
 not not do this is if you go back to 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.379
 facebook subject you will put the 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.689
 your fan page is fine but know too 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.749
 it does not mean anything because I you 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:47.240
 puts signatures on fanpage and has already had 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:51.500
 my photo and used by the third 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.750
 without authorization and warranty 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.639
 sign because nobody is my photo 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.779
 one can characterize cutting point 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.250
 the picture then became very important at the time 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.319
 to deliver the client delivers everything 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.680
 signed the person goes there and cuts a photo 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.389
 it changes stable framing 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.189
 the composition you did it because 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.460
 she does not want to publish with the signature and 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.960
 I deliver the photos on top and in my case 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.300
 how to photograph sexy essays 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.849
 female photography and female photography 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.099
 extremely delicate and I do not want 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.740
 apply it soon because I think she 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.199
 will give a greater weight there and will end 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.120
 polluting the photograph of course I run the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.120
 risk of someone else's very 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.520
 toxic is stealing this photo but like 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.680
 someone said the person can cut himself 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.779
 characterize your photo is 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.629
 anyway from the moment that 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.360
 Your picture is online on the internet, you go. 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.979
 run the risk with a logo or not 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.779
 nothing prevents someone from delivering us to 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.149
 Your picture is the same as many. 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.610
 you have to take your picture on the 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:54.919
 I was published in a newspaper one 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.389
 reviewed a communication vehicle 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.789
 only people forget that the 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.159
 quality of it is down to 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.960
 internet photography it stays up to 72 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:07.129
 dp go to have a photo 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.990
 printed more than 150 to 300 of the IPI 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.210
 so if a person prints his or her 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.949
 photography she will consequently have 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.759
 in low quality will not stay so 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.289

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.770
