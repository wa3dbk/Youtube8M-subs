00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
whole entire match to himself they would

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.540 
whole entire match to himself they would
have<00:02:22.780> CM<00:02:23.110> Punk<00:02:23.379> be<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> guy<00:02:23.860> who<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.160> do<00:02:24.340> that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
have CM Punk be the guy who can do that

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.580 
have CM Punk be the guy who can do that
like<00:02:24.910> he<00:02:25.030> did<00:02:25.209> at<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.569> Royal<00:02:25.780> Rumble<00:02:25.810> and

John<00:03:50.109> Cena<00:03:50.380> has<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.769> face<00:03:50.950> him<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.940> has<00:03:52.359> to

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
John Cena has to face him so it has to

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.059 
John Cena has to face him so it has to
be<00:03:52.690> on<00:03:52.840> Cena<00:03:53.079> but<00:03:53.230> if<00:03:53.349> they<00:03:53.470> toss<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:53.889> like<00:03:54.040> a

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
be on Cena but if they toss in like a

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.129 
be on Cena but if they toss in like a
triple<00:03:54.370> threat<00:03:54.489> kind<00:03:55.359> of<00:03:55.389> thing<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.780> think<00:03:56.049> the

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
triple threat kind of thing I think the

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.670 
triple threat kind of thing I think the
third<00:03:56.380> guy<00:03:56.680> will<00:03:57.549> either<00:03:57.760> have<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.450> be<00:03:58.720> Brock

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
third guy will either have to be Brock

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.199 
third guy will either have to be Brock
Lesnar<00:04:00.010> could<00:04:00.900> possibly<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.230> Triple<00:04:02.650> H<00:04:02.889> but<00:04:03.819> I

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
Lesnar could possibly be Triple H but I

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.150 
Lesnar could possibly be Triple H but I
really<00:04:04.780> don't<00:04:04.989> know<00:04:05.079> but<00:04:05.530> it'll<00:04:05.829> have<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:06.069> be

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
really don't know but it'll have to be

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.770 
really don't know but it'll have to be
John<00:04:06.370> Cena<00:04:06.639> right<00:04:06.849> now<00:04:07.000> if<00:04:07.329> they<00:04:07.480> don't<00:04:07.630> do<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
John Cena right now if they don't do a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.740 
John Cena right now if they don't do a
triple<00:04:08.019> threat<00:04:08.139> match<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:09.069> um<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:10.269> kind<00:04:10.599> of

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
triple threat match so um that's kind of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.129 
triple threat match so um that's kind of
tossing<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.530> wind<00:04:11.769> basically<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.669> then<00:04:12.819> um

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
tossing the wind basically and then um

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.330 
tossing the wind basically and then um
