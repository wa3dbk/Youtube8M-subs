00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
over too much especially the first two

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.040 
over too much especially the first two
interceptions<00:00:21.090> when<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.480> still<00:00:21.720> were<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.150 
you know really hurt and you know I felt
like<00:00:24.930> especially<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.949> third

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
like especially the first one is third

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800 
like especially the first one is third
down<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.699> moving<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> ball<00:00:27.180> we're<00:00:27.570> coming

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
down we're moving the ball we're coming

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
down we're moving the ball we're coming
back<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.289> feel<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.740> were<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> you

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
back I feel like we were in it and you

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.460 
back I feel like we were in it and you
know<00:00:30.179> had<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> been<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> conversion<00:00:31.140> had<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
know had that been a conversion had I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
know had that been a conversion had I
you<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.160> turn<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> ball<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:32.700> there<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you know not turn the ball over there I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.090 
you know not turn the ball over there I
think<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.260> you'd<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
think you know you'd like to think the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.350 
think you know you'd like to think the
game<00:00:35.280> could<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.460> taken<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:35.969> different

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
game could have taken on a lot different

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.260 
game could have taken on a lot different
tale<00:00:37.219> and<00:00:38.219> after<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:39.059> something

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
tale and after that is just something

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.030 
tale and after that is just something
that<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.570> snowballs<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.800> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that kind of snowballs and you know that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
that kind of snowballs and you know that
you<00:00:41.129> start<00:00:41.430> pressing<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.210> point<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you start pressing from that point on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
you start pressing from that point on
you<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> whole<00:00:43.230> yeah<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.190> mean<00:00:44.340> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you think just as a whole yeah I mean I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
you think just as a whole yeah I mean I
think<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> certainly<00:00:45.149> played<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> part<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
think that certainly played a part of it

think that certainly played a part of it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
get behind but I don't want to turn the
ball<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> first<00:01:19.680> place

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
ball over in the first place

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
ball over in the first place
you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.350> snowballs<00:01:22.920> because

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you know and it just snowballs because

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560 
you know and it just snowballs because
you<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.610> defense<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.210> behind<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you put your defense then behind the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.670 
you put your defense then behind the
eight<00:01:24.689> ball<00:01:24.720> when<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> short<00:01:25.500> field

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
eight ball when they have a short field

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370 
eight ball when they have a short field
to<00:01:25.890> defend<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.020> they're<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.140> too<00:01:28.259> many

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to defend and they're just too many

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
to defend and they're just too many
times<00:01:28.619> tonight<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.729> made

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
times tonight where I are we made

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.819 
times tonight where I are we made
mistakes<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
mistakes and it just made things that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.899 
mistakes and it just made things that
much<00:01:31.979> harder<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:32.460> back<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.670> hard

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
much harder to come back from is it hard

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
much harder to come back from is it hard
especially<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.509> context<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.920> guys<00:01:38.040> had

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
especially the context of you guys had

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.190 
especially the context of you guys had
had<00:01:38.759> played<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.150> well<00:01:39.180> last<00:01:39.509> couple<00:01:39.750> weeks<00:01:39.780> but

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
had played so well last couple weeks but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
had played so well last couple weeks but
also<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.829> guys<00:01:41.130> wanted<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> halftime

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
also because you guys wanted to halftime

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.660 
also because you guys wanted to halftime
particularly<00:01:42.329> down<00:01:42.450> 10<00:01:42.750> -<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.350> mean<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.520> come

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
particularly down 10 - I mean to come

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.530 
particularly down 10 - I mean to come
out<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> second<00:01:45.090> half<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> imagine

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
out in the second half have to imagine

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.490 
out in the second half have to imagine
it<00:01:45.720> makes<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.380> difficult

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it makes things a little more difficult

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100 
it makes things a little more difficult
to<00:01:46.770> stomach<00:01:47.360> yeah<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.479> were<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
to stomach yeah we were right there and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
to stomach yeah we were right there and
we<00:01:49.229> scored<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> first<00:01:49.890> drive<00:01:50.159> coming<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we scored the first drive coming out the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.060 
we scored the first drive coming out the
second<00:01:51.360> half<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.950> were<00:01:53.040> doing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
second half so you know we were doing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.310 
second half so you know we were doing
good<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.840> were<00:01:54.899> parts<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
good things and there were parts in the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.359 
good things and there were parts in the
first<00:01:55.470> half<00:01:55.710> where<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:55.979> felt<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.219> we

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
first half where we felt like we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
first half where we felt like we
probably<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.820> been<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.869> lot

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
probably should have been you know a lot

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
probably should have been you know a lot
better<00:01:58.469> off<00:01:58.740> than<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.009> were<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> score

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
better off than we were with the score

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
better off than we were with the score
was<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.180> halftime<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.860> through

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
was at halftime so all the way through

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.289 
was at halftime so all the way through
we<00:02:02.189> felt<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.549> were<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:02.759> until<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
we felt like we were right there until I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.550 
we felt like we were right there until I
think<00:02:03.509> those<00:02:03.659> turnover<00:02:04.049> started<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> really

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
think those turnover started to really

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310 
think those turnover started to really
kill<00:02:04.829> us<00:02:04.969> when<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.090> guys<00:02:06.180> came<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.600> after

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
kill us when you guys came out after

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
kill us when you guys came out after
after<00:02:07.590> halftime<00:02:07.770> he<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.429> rhythm<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
after halftime he had a good rhythm and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.270 
after halftime he had a good rhythm and
everything

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
everything

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.370 
everything
what<00:02:09.490> was<00:02:09.670> working<00:02:10.090> there<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.929> do<00:02:11.020> they<00:02:11.230> make

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
what was working there and do they make

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.559 
what was working there and do they make
adjustments<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.100> force<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.209> guys<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:13.540> of

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
adjustments to force you guys out of

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.120 
adjustments to force you guys out of
that<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.170> next<00:02:14.380> position<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.100> I

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
that on the next position you know I

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.320 
that on the next position you know I
really<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.490> think<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.940> think<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.300> really

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
really don't think so I think it really

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.000 
really don't think so I think it really
goes<00:02:16.600> back<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.050> turnovers<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:17.830> that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
goes back to the turnovers I think that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.580 
goes back to the turnovers I think that
um<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:19.990> were<00:02:20.170> running<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> ball

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
um you know we were running the ball

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
um you know we were running the ball
well<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.950> had<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> good<00:02:21.190> mix<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.490> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
well we had a good mix of the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.750 
well we had a good mix of the
play-action<00:02:21.910> pass<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.459> we<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
play-action pass and we just we have to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.040 
play-action pass and we just we have to
be<00:02:24.880> better<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.569> better<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.840> third

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
be better I have to be better on third

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.660 
be better I have to be better on third
down<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.290> has<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.040> be<00:02:27.100> better<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.520> know

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
down and has to be better you know

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.920 
down and has to be better you know
protecting<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> football<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.840> do

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
protecting the football and if we do

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.290 
protecting the football and if we do
that<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:30.160> think<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.819> would<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.000> been<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> much

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
that I think it would have been a much

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.150 
that I think it would have been a much
better<00:02:31.330> result<00:02:31.660> tonight<00:02:31.959> trick<00:02:32.800> what<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.100> you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
in it and like I said it just started to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.750 
in it and like I said it just started to
snowball<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.310> get<00:04:03.519> late<00:04:03.670> in
