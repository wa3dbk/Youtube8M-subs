around man and machine to the absolute
extreme<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.739> wanted<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.430> explore

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

the human body and with the facets of
the<00:00:50.010> car<00:00:50.250> being<00:00:50.489> merged<00:00:50.760> upon<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.660> almost<00:00:52.320> as

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the car being merged upon it almost as

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.610 
the car being merged upon it almost as
if<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.859> machine<00:00:53.250> had<00:00:54.090> taken<00:00:54.600> over<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.410> body

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
if the machine had taken over the body

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.139

for<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> period<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:57.769> cars<00:00:58.769> they<00:00:59.760> carry<00:01:00.000> our

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
for a period of time cars they carry our

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
for a period of time cars they carry our
motion<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.780> design<00:01:01.199> everything<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
motion so we design everything in a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.970 
motion so we design everything in a
motion<00:01:02.219> such<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> big<00:01:02.879> driver<00:01:03.269> in<00:01:04.140> everything

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
motion such a big driver in everything

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.450 
motion such a big driver in everything
we<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.140> relationship<00:01:07.140> between<00:01:07.460> us

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
we do and the relationship between us

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.910 
we do and the relationship between us
and<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.360> machines<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.080> technology<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and our machines and our technology is a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.539 
and our machines and our technology is a
really<00:01:11.220> interesting<00:01:11.430> thing<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.540> us<00:01:13.549> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
really interesting thing for us the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.730 
really interesting thing for us the
first<00:01:14.790> image<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.479> saw<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> NX<00:01:16.380> or

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
first image that we saw of the NX or

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
first image that we saw of the NX or
greeted<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> real<00:01:17.880> power<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.570> know

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
greeted us with this real power you know
that<00:01:18.810> kind<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.049> framed<00:01:19.710> itself<00:01:20.159> almost<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.700> if

a face its grille the structure of the
eyes<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.530> started<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.130> about

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
eyes we really started to think about

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
eyes we really started to think about
the<00:01:26.460> car<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.820> hero<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.200> of

to them and through that I want to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.319 
to them and through that I want to
create<00:02:03.630> almost<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:05.009> running<00:02:05.700> river<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
create almost like a running river of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
create almost like a running river of
red<00:02:06.539> accents<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.130> saying<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.430> know

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
red accents and it's the saying you know

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.950 
red accents and it's the saying you know
when<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:08.850> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> stitching's<00:02:09.630> we've

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
when you look in the stitching's we've

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.910 
when you look in the stitching's we've
got<00:02:10.140> those<00:02:10.259> accent

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
got those accent

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
got those accent
and<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.600> will<00:02:12.750> come<00:02:12.930> through<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.230> sort

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and and that will come through and sort

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.110 
and and that will come through and sort
of<00:02:13.440> digital<00:02:13.590> stitching<00:02:14.370> through<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> surface

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
of digital stitching through the surface

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.309 
of digital stitching through the surface
of<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.300> nails<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.420> starting<00:02:21.840> point<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
of the nails the starting point for the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.199 
of the nails the starting point for the
project<00:02:22.440> was<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.400> start<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> mood<00:02:24.000> board

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
project was we start with a mood board

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.880 
project was we start with a mood board
theme<00:02:24.540> boards<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.170> took<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> colorways

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
theme boards we took all the colorways

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.790 
theme boards we took all the colorways
and<00:02:26.069> angles<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.240> then<00:02:27.600> we'll<00:02:27.750> sketch<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.740> we

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
and angles and then we'll sketch so we

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
and angles and then we'll sketch so we
did<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> series<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> drawings<00:02:29.970> we<00:02:30.150> start<00:02:30.390> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
did a series of drawings we start to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.660 
did a series of drawings we start to
think<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:30.780> how<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.440> move<00:02:31.830> those<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.490> we

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
think about how we move those that we

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.090 
think about how we move those that we
visualize<00:02:33.630> those<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.290> three-dimensional

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
visualize those in three-dimensional

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.850 
visualize those in three-dimensional
data<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:36.660> do<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.080> work<00:02:37.350> with<00:02:37.620> plugins

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
data we do a lot of work with plugins

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
data we do a lot of work with plugins
like<00:02:38.310> grasshopper<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.030> rhino<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.989> we<00:02:40.080> would

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
like grasshopper a rhino so we would

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
like grasshopper a rhino so we would
immediately<00:02:40.350> move<00:02:40.830> into<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.190> space<00:02:41.250> where

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
immediately move into that space where

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.490 
immediately move into that space where
we<00:02:42.330> map<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> body<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
we map in the body so that the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.010 
we map in the body so that the
silhouette<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.100> completely<00:02:44.640> authentic<00:02:45.180> well

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
silhouette is completely authentic well

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.290 
silhouette is completely authentic well
then<00:02:46.170> starts<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> prototype<00:02:47.100> green<00:02:47.310> card<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
then starts a prototype green card to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
then starts a prototype green card to
get<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.630> right<00:02:48.870> form<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.500> shapes<00:02:49.769> or<00:02:50.100> beam

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
get the right form and shapes or beam

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.430 
get the right form and shapes or beam
moving<00:02:50.970> really<00:02:51.150> between<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.570> digital<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
moving really between the digital and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.660 
moving really between the digital and
physical<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.040> time<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.519> that's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
physical all the time and that's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
physical all the time and that's
inherent<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.330> everything<00:02:54.690> we<00:02:55.140> do<00:02:55.260> it's<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.530> do

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
inherent and everything we do it's to do

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.060 
inherent and everything we do it's to do
so<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.930> we've<00:02:58.140> been<00:02:58.320> green<00:02:58.560> screaming

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
so and then we've been green screaming

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.460 
so and then we've been green screaming
so<00:02:59.400> literally<00:03:00.060> spray<00:03:00.420> canning<00:03:00.930> things<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
so literally spray canning things and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.560 
so literally spray canning things and
using<00:03:01.950> nail<00:03:02.280> varnish<00:03:02.850> we're<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.330> Magpies

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
using nail varnish we're like Magpies

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.750 
using nail varnish we're like Magpies
stealing<00:03:04.260> things<00:03:04.530> from<00:03:04.620> other<00:03:04.830> industries<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
stealing things from other industries to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.940 
stealing things from other industries to
create<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.690> end<00:03:06.840> result<00:03:07.200> which<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.709> big

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
create the end result which is this big

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.540 
create the end result which is this big
narrative<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:12.810> we<00:03:12.930> moved<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.380> into<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.250> film

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
narrative then we moved it into the film

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.280 
narrative then we moved it into the film
space<00:03:14.850> we've<00:03:15.090> built<00:03:15.390> our<00:03:15.510> own<00:03:15.630> set<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.170> we're

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
space we've built our own set so we're

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.490 
space we've built our own set so we're
using<00:03:17.120> beautiful<00:03:18.120> materials<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.930> perspex

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
using beautiful materials like perspex

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.319 
using beautiful materials like perspex
where<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:19.890> get<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.100> real<00:03:20.370> resonance<00:03:21.209> in

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
where you can get this real resonance in

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.449 
where you can get this real resonance in
terms<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.630> echoes<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.290> shadows<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.100> that

terms of echoes and shadows and that

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.310 
terms of echoes and shadows and that
that's<00:03:23.670> inherent<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.019> things<00:03:25.170> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
that's inherent in all the things that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960 
that's inherent in all the things that
we're<00:03:25.500> doing<00:03:25.620> you're<00:03:25.860> not<00:03:25.890> almost<00:03:26.130> moving

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
we're doing you're not almost moving

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.370 
we're doing you're not almost moving
between<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.390> angles<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.959> almost<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
between the angles and almost like a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.490 
between the angles and almost like a
liquid<00:03:28.650> interface<00:03:29.780> we<00:03:30.780> love<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.079> idea<00:03:31.200> that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
liquid interface we love the idea that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.979 
liquid interface we love the idea that
that<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.790> wear<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> car<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.600> know<00:03:33.750> it's

that you you wear a car you know it's

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
that you you wear a car you know it's
