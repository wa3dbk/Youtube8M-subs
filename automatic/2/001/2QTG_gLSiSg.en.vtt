00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
bone ceramics in there with the bearing

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
bone ceramics in there with the bearing
spacers<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.690> that's<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> board<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:48.030> got

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
spacers and that's the board and I got

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.799 
spacers and that's the board and I got
this<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> month<00:00:48.840> ago<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.600> I've<00:00:51.600> been

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
this about a month ago and I've been

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.010 
this about a month ago and I've been
using<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.329> been<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.780> far

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
using it a lot and it's been so far

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.549 
using it a lot and it's been so far
really<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.949> downhill<00:00:56.780> cruising<00:00:57.780> I'm

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
really good for downhill cruising I'm

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
really good for downhill cruising I'm
not<00:00:58.710> much<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> carver<00:00:59.520> since<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.120> first

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
not much of a carver since it's my first

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.789 
not much of a carver since it's my first
longboard<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.859> I'll<00:01:02.250> try<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.530> very

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
longboard so I'll try it and it's very

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.880 
longboard so I'll try it and it's very
good<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> only<00:01:05.610> problem<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.350> might<00:01:07.560> hear

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
good the only problem is you might hear

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179 
good the only problem is you might hear
cracking<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.390> trucks<00:01:10.290> si<00:01:10.799> trucks

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
cracking if you get the trucks si trucks

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.320 
cracking if you get the trucks si trucks
or<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> original<00:01:13.890> longboard<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
or just a original longboard like a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
or just a original longboard like a
pintail<00:01:15.810> because<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.500> these<00:01:16.680> trucks<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pintail because you get these trucks you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.820 
pintail because you get these trucks you
might<00:01:18.450> hear<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> cracking<00:01:19.470> noise<00:01:21.080> it's<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
might hear a cracking noise it's not the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
might hear a cracking noise it's not the
board<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.840> inside<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:26.570> here<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
board it's just inside in here like that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.370 
board it's just inside in here like that
little<00:01:28.380> white<00:01:28.560> piece<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:30.900> white<00:01:31.170> piece

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
little white piece this white piece

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130 
little white piece this white piece
right<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.939> needs<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.659> lubricated

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right here that needs to be lubricated

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.490 
right here that needs to be lubricated
with<00:01:34.829> white<00:01:35.159> lithium<00:01:35.400> grease<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:39.500> basically

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
with white lithium grease and basically

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.749 
with white lithium grease and basically
these<00:01:41.360> trucks<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.570> high<00:01:42.780> maintenance

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
these trucks are high maintenance

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
these trucks are high maintenance
because<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> components

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
because as you can see the components

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.300 
because as you can see the components
are<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:46.979> opened<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.450> all<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
are all opened and all that but I'm

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.280 
are all opened and all that but I'm
telling<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.030> goes<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:52.229> for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
telling you it goes it's very good for

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.929 
telling you it goes it's very good for
downhill<00:01:53.270> cruising<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:55.680> know<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.070> ride

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
downhill cruising you know that ride

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.370 
downhill cruising you know that ride
smooth<00:01:58.070> but<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.219> these<00:01:59.490> trucks<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.350> got<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
smooth but on these trucks you got a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440 
smooth but on these trucks you got a
maintenance<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.189> least<00:02:02.369> every<00:02:02.759> month

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
maintenance them at least every month

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.010 
maintenance them at least every month
and<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.850> from<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.149> other<00:02:06.390> video<00:02:06.750> where

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and I got from this other video where

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.500 
and I got from this other video where
you<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.320> sandpaper<00:02:09.379> sand<00:02:10.379> paper<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.510> sided

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you put sandpaper sand paper and sided

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
you put sandpaper sand paper and sided
here<00:02:12.900> where<00:02:13.170> they

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
here where they

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.399 
here where they
if<00:02:13.680> cam<00:02:13.950> sits<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:15.569> roughing<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.319> a

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
if cam sits you just roughing it up a

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.830 
if cam sits you just roughing it up a
little<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.830> fine<00:02:17.159> fine<00:02:17.909> sandpaper<00:02:18.480> not

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
little bit with fine fine sandpaper not

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.110 
little bit with fine fine sandpaper not
course<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.379> course<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:19.799> rip<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.370> but

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
course because course will rip it up but

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
course because course will rip it up but
just<00:02:21.209> find<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.629> rub<00:02:21.900> around<00:02:22.019> two<00:02:22.349> times<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
just find this rub around two times and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
just find this rub around two times and
it's<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.629> would<00:02:24.780> um<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.769> shave<00:02:26.730> down

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it's like it would um like shave down

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
it's like it would um like shave down
the<00:02:27.510> molding<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> kind<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.709> messed<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.159> in<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the molding that kind of messed up in it

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.819 
the molding that kind of messed up in it
so<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.909> can<00:02:30.060> help<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.480> squeak<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.650> more

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
so it can help not squeak and get more

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.280 
so it can help not squeak and get more
lithium<00:02:32.069> grease<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.209> we<00:02:33.480> could<00:02:33.690> last

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
lithium grease in there so we could last

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.020 
lithium grease in there so we could last
longer<00:02:34.470> without<00:02:35.099> squeaking<00:02:35.610> or<00:02:35.730> making<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
longer without squeaking or making a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
probably gonna do a cleaning and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
probably gonna do a cleaning and
maintenance<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> whole<00:03:31.889> board<00:03:32.160> probably

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
maintenance to the whole board probably

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.020 
maintenance to the whole board probably
just<00:03:33.150> have<00:03:33.889> take<00:03:34.889> off<00:03:35.069> everything<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.910> do

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
just have take off everything to do

bearing cleaning and all that probably I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.710 
bearing cleaning and all that probably I
got<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.139> idea<00:03:40.440> from<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.459> other<00:03:41.879> video<00:03:42.120> I

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
got the idea from this other video I

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.180 
got the idea from this other video I
could<00:03:43.019> probably<00:03:43.169> just<00:03:43.379> do<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> link<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.010> sniff

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
could probably just do a link and sniff

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.150 
could probably just do a link and sniff
