00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 good afternoon friends with you today 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 Frunza Vladimir 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.290
 this time I want to show you how 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 play short backgammon at the moment 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.870
 you are observing this field standard 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.330
 the location of the fish I finally 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.000
 restored his backgammon more or less 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.510
 put in order 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 children of the zone got new fishes for me 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.280
 because the kids are my plants are them but 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.790
 new castles behind the rivers i will show later 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 let's go to our game 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:01.530
 then you are watching the backgammon is shorter 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.009
 long we play as one 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.110
 side that is, you remember the rules of the game 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:12.479
 we have chips 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:16.710
 from here to here also goes with us and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.840
 the other side from here to here yes but for 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.289
 it just needs to be changed 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.350
 layouts of chips or indicate differently 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:33.390
 you can just flip on turning 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.679
 Backgammon in the opposite direction we enter another 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.020
 the side that is black turns out goes 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.459
 over here 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.840
 nice circle go around here why 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:50.290
 This game I turn over the standard 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.660
 the game 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.230
 because I'm used to playing precisely in 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.370
 however let's look at why the game 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.400
 called short backgammon short 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.720
 backgammon this game is called one by one 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.920
 the simple reason is that half the chips 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.550
 see by location 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.710
 half fisher is already on the way 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.530
 home 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.120
 features the difference between long and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.740
 short narts in the short can 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 knock out knocking a chip that is, let's say 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:37.090
 our chip was black here I killed 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.090
 white chip is placed on the board above 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.239
 have a rival know your what you need 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.209
 start the game over here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.370
 chip benefits that is, he starts everything 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:55.450
 first starts the circle and goes gradually 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.760
 goes gradually your house standard 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.010
 position in the game 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.930
 let's say the beginning of the game is here 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.630
 let's all still in the process of this show 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.220
 will be more clearly so I played 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:14.820
 black for learning i play with myself 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.820
 just going to be different chips 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:26.980
 42 such friends 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:30.280
 doubles 423,546 are played at home that is 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.490
 look i took from here and the hall from here 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.520
 she's a four here she is a deuce now 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.040
 nickname 32 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.370
 it is the sum of 5 and in order not to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.690
 leave open then they are not knocked out 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:56.640
 I go here that is 1 2 3 4 5 now 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:00.120
 my move 43 43 standard stone usually 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.250
 here comes here that is here you would have 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.950
 there were six here 7 4 and 3 this forces now 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:16.860
 instead of the opponent 21 here by the harder 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:19.260
 situation but let's say not really like 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.390
 it is said difficult twos I go 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.090
 here and open at the beginning of the game that is 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.090
 even if they beat me out let's say such 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.330
 situation is okay i'm at it 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.570
 at the beginning, that is, if 1 comes out and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.960
 leave him worse than because 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.440
 do we have a chance to knock him out and he needs 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:49.820
 start from the very beginning we are so and so 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.820
 is at first 21 lichku my move 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.889
 and
