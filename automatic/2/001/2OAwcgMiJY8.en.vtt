00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
crawlers and mainly it depends on the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
crawlers and mainly it depends on the
size<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.890> play<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> bonobo<00:00:38.579> because

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
size you know I play on a bonobo because

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.700 
size you know I play on a bonobo because
this<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> most<00:00:39.570> crawlers<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.620> if

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this has the most crawlers see if

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
this has the most crawlers see if
there's<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> smaller<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.520> he's<00:00:41.790> gonna<00:00:41.910> jump<00:00:42.360> up

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
there's a smaller one he's gonna jump up

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
there's a smaller one he's gonna jump up
and<00:00:42.660> bite<00:00:42.719> me<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> trick<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.399> get<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and bite me but the trick is get to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610 
and bite me but the trick is get to
somewhere<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.510> weather<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.960> forest<00:00:46.410> or
