Africa but now it's really a bad weed in
the<00:01:07.520> bush<00:01:07.700> because<00:01:07.820> it<00:01:08.060> can<00:01:08.240> burn<00:01:08.420> all<00:01:08.750> sorts

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.230 

we<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.159> want<00:02:05.400> them<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.640> drop<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> ground

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we don't want them to drop on the ground

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.169 
we don't want them to drop on the ground
we<00:02:06.860> try<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.160> good<00:02:08.369> handful<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.970> berries

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
we try to get a good handful of berries

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.220 
we try to get a good handful of berries
and<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.929> spit<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.319> off<00:02:10.470> over<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> bag

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and just spit them off over to the bag

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.570 
and just spit them off over to the bag
another<00:02:13.230> way<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> deal<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.069> berries<00:02:14.430> is

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
another way to deal with the berries is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.130 
another way to deal with the berries is
to<00:02:14.730> cut<00:02:14.940> off<00:02:15.120> some<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.720> stems

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
to cut off some of the little stems

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.559 
to cut off some of the little stems
they're<00:02:16.380> attached<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.060> bag<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
they're attached to and just bag the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.750 
they're attached to and just bag the
whole<00:02:18.720> lot<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> important<00:02:20.190> thing<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
whole lot but the important thing is

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300 
whole lot but the important thing is
that<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.989> don't<00:02:22.140> want<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.500> cut<00:02:22.709> off<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> lot<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that we don't want to cut off a lot of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.360 
that we don't want to cut off a lot of
the<00:02:23.400> foliage<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.540> these<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.989> is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
the foliage with one of these that is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.070 
the foliage with one of these that is
when<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.520> use<00:02:26.700> herbicide<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.330> bit<00:02:27.600> later<00:02:27.840> on

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
when we use herbicide a bit later on

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.070 
when we use herbicide a bit later on
that<00:02:28.920> foliage<00:02:29.430> has<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.959> help

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
that foliage has got to be there to help

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.610 
that foliage has got to be there to help
the<00:02:31.290> plant<00:02:31.590> absorb<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.370> herbicide<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.620> allow

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the plant absorb the herbicide and allow

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.410 
the plant absorb the herbicide and allow
it<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:35.069> its<00:02:35.250> job<00:02:37.790> there's<00:02:38.790> no<00:02:38.880> risk<00:02:39.209> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
it to do its job there's no risk of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.130 
it to do its job there's no risk of
pulling<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> leaves<00:02:40.080> off<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:40.560> they're

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
pulling the leaves off because they're

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.750 
pulling the leaves off because they're
attached<00:02:43.140> quite<00:02:43.500> hard<00:02:43.860> harder<00:02:44.459> than<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
attached quite hard harder than the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.650 
attached quite hard harder than the
fruits<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.100> beautiful<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:47.819> it's<00:02:48.510> a

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
fruits it is beautiful but it's a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.160 
fruits it is beautiful but it's a
nuisance<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.980> undesirable<00:02:53.670> too<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.569> you

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
nuisance and undesirable too because you

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.620 
nuisance and undesirable too because you
don't<00:02:55.380> want<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> dig<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.160> whole<00:02:56.430> Bank<00:02:56.760> or

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
don't want to dig up this whole Bank or

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.100 
don't want to dig up this whole Bank or
disturb<00:02:58.350> other<00:02:58.709> plants<00:02:59.220> at<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.400> nearby<00:03:00.110> what

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
disturb other plants at the nearby what

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.960 
disturb other plants at the nearby what
I've<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.470> here<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.799> some<00:03:02.100> Roundup<00:03:02.940> herbicide

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
I've got here is some Roundup herbicide

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.819 
I've got here is some Roundup herbicide
or<00:03:03.690> glyphosate<00:03:05.090> which<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.750> not<00:03:06.930> diluted<00:03:07.319> it's

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
or glyphosate which is not diluted it's

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.770 
or glyphosate which is not diluted it's
got<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> bit<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.340> blue<00:03:08.519> dye<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.600> can

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
got a bit of blue dye in it so we can

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.870 
got a bit of blue dye in it so we can
see<00:03:09.989> where<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.739> I've<00:03:11.310> got<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> strong

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
see where it is and I've got a strong

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
see where it is and I've got a strong
knife<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.430> typical<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.060> ahkna<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.630> that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
knife this is typical of ahkna in that

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
knife this is typical of ahkna in that
it<00:03:16.049> has<00:03:16.230> been<00:03:16.440> cut<00:03:16.709> back<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.130> past<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
it has been cut back in the past and

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.569 
it has been cut back in the past and
it's<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.359> got<00:03:18.600> sprouted<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.410> again<00:03:19.680> with<00:03:19.890> more

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
it's now got sprouted up again with more

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's now got sprouted up again with more
than<00:03:20.700> one<00:03:20.910> stem<00:03:21.299> here's<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.720> main<00:03:21.930> one

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
than one stem here's the main one

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.440 
than one stem here's the main one
there's<00:03:22.709> another<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.940> side<00:03:24.180> shoots

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
there's another one and the side shoots

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.860 
there's another one and the side shoots
coming<00:03:24.780> off<00:03:25.310> right<00:03:26.310> down<00:03:26.519> near<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.970> base<00:03:27.150> so

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
coming off right down near the base so

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.210 
coming off right down near the base so
we're<00:03:28.140> going<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.590> deal<00:03:28.799> with<00:03:28.980> all<00:03:29.190> of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
we're going to have to deal with all of

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.500 
we're going to have to deal with all of
them<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:30.030> can't<00:03:30.299> just<00:03:30.600> do<00:03:30.810> one<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:33.030> what<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.359> do

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
them you can't just do one so what I do

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.310 
them you can't just do one so what I do
is<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:35.070> big<00:03:35.280> one<00:03:35.459> I'll<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.109> with

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
is on the big one I'll just do this with

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.750 
is on the big one I'll just do this with
the<00:03:37.470> knife<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.549> inner<00:03:39.450> part<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
the knife so that the inner part of the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.759 
the knife so that the inner part of the
dish<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.940> exposed<00:03:42.510> where<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> sap<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.350> moving

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
dish is exposed where the sap is moving

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.440 
dish is exposed where the sap is moving
and<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.750> put<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> dribble<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:47.269> herbicide<00:03:48.269> on

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
and I just put a dribble of herbicide on

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.349 
and I just put a dribble of herbicide on
it<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.989> leave<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:50.760> can<00:03:50.970> do<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> bit

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
it and just leave it you can do a bit

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.770 
it and just leave it you can do a bit
more<00:03:51.569> up<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:53.370> good<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.819> do<00:03:53.970> about<00:03:54.480> 10

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
more up here it's good to do about 10

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.640 
more up here it's good to do about 10
centimetres<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:56.060> regulation<00:03:57.170> now<00:03:58.170> that's<00:03:58.380> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
centimetres is regulation now that's a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.830 
centimetres is regulation now that's a
fairly<00:03:59.040> fixed<00:03:59.549> end<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.030> we<00:04:00.299> should<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.630> another

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
fairly fixed end so we should do another

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.460 
fairly fixed end so we should do another
one<00:04:01.250> around<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> back<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.079> it's<00:04:04.230> thicker

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
one around the back and if it's thicker

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.770 
one around the back and if it's thicker
than<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.370> could<00:04:05.579> do<00:04:05.730> three<00:04:06.090> scrapes

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
than that you could do three scrapes

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.740 
than that you could do three scrapes
like<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:08.579> important<00:04:09.060> thing<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.450> that

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
like that the important thing is that

you do put the herbicide on within 15
seconds

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
seconds

shoot here this is a separate little

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.990 
shoot here this is a separate little
stem<00:04:21.970> I'm<00:04:22.810> going<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.730> scrape<00:04:24.730> this

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
stem I'm going to have to scrape this

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.650 
stem I'm going to have to scrape this
one<00:04:25.240> as<00:04:25.540> well<00:04:25.810> as<00:04:25.990> best<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.410> can<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:34.540> can

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
see here to make sure the herbicide gets

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.360 
see here to make sure the herbicide gets
up<00:04:52.510> right<00:04:52.870> up<00:04:53.050> into<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.440> is<00:04:53.590> just<00:04:53.890> break<00:04:54.160> the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
up right up into it is just break the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.540 
up right up into it is just break the
top<00:04:54.610> off<00:04:54.960> where<00:04:55.960> we're<00:04:56.830> just<00:04:57.040> snapping<00:04:57.310> it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
top off where we're just snapping it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.180 
top off where we're just snapping it
over<00:04:58.260> bending<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.380> but<00:04:59.530> we're<00:04:59.710> not<00:04:59.890> we<00:05:00.160> don't

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
over bending it but we're not we don't

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.820 
over bending it but we're not we don't
want<00:05:00.580> it<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.790> come<00:05:01.210> away<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:02.140> he'll<00:05:02.380> see<00:05:02.620> how

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
want it to come away so he'll see how

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.180 
want it to come away so he'll see how
we've<00:05:03.040> just<00:05:03.280> made<00:05:03.660> an<00:05:04.660> opening<00:05:05.350> there<00:05:05.590> but

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
we've just made an opening there but

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.480 
we've just made an opening there but
we've<00:05:06.370> left<00:05:06.580> back<00:05:06.910> it's<00:05:07.870> connecting<00:05:08.440> this<00:05:08.860> bit

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
we've left back it's connecting this bit

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.090 
we've left back it's connecting this bit
to<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.270> flower<00:05:10.630> stem<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.230> we<00:05:11.320> put<00:05:11.620> herbicide

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
to the flower stem and we put herbicide

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.790 
to the flower stem and we put herbicide
on<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.420> would<00:05:13.630> also<00:05:13.900> do<00:05:14.230> that<00:05:14.260> on<00:05:14.590> some

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
on that and I would also do that on some

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.890 
on that and I would also do that on some
of<00:05:14.950> these<00:05:15.070> other<00:05:15.960> thicker<00:05:16.960> stems<00:05:18.360> like<00:05:19.360> that

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.560 

and<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.050> leave<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:24.090> it's<00:05:25.090> not<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.300> pretty

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
and you just leave it it's not a pretty

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.570 
and you just leave it it's not a pretty
look<00:05:25.660> if<00:05:26.170> you've<00:05:26.500> got<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.890> in<00:05:27.010> your<00:05:27.130> garden<00:05:27.280> at

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
look if you've got it in your garden at

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.610 
look if you've got it in your garden at
home<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:28.540> have<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.960> put<00:05:29.170> up<00:05:29.290> with<00:05:29.470> it

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
home you just have to put up with it

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.070 
home you just have to put up with it
looking<00:05:30.010> dead<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.730> then<00:05:31.090> our<00:05:31.390> six<00:05:31.750> three<00:05:32.020> or

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
looking dead and then our six three or

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.249 
looking dead and then our six three or
four<00:05:32.320> weeks<00:05:32.620> ago<00:05:32.890> or<00:05:33.130> dropped<00:05:33.520> its<00:05:33.700> wings<00:05:34.000> and

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
four weeks ago or dropped its wings and

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.779 
four weeks ago or dropped its wings and
I've<00:05:35.469> waited<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.919> little<00:05:36.099> while<00:05:36.279> after<00:05:36.580> that

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
I've waited a little while after that

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.760 
I've waited a little while after that
before<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.449> cut<00:05:37.659> it<00:05:37.779> down<00:05:38.020> because<00:05:38.319> you<00:05:38.740> don't

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
before you cut it down because you don't

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.809 
before you cut it down because you don't
cut<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.729> plant<00:05:40.479> off<00:05:40.659> too<00:05:40.930> soon<00:05:41.430> this<00:05:42.430> is<00:05:42.490> one

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
cut the plant off too soon this is one

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.540 
cut the plant off too soon this is one
of<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.029> seedlings<00:05:43.539> that's<00:05:44.039> growing<00:05:45.039> from<00:05:45.400> the

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
of the seedlings that's growing from the

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.649 
of the seedlings that's growing from the
plant<00:05:45.819> we've<00:05:46.029> just<00:05:47.009> dealt<00:05:48.009> with<00:05:48.129> and<00:05:48.629> I'm<00:05:49.629> not

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
plant we've just dealt with and I'm not

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.619 
plant we've just dealt with and I'm not
sure<00:05:49.990> about<00:05:50.219> trying<00:05:51.219> to<00:05:51.310> dig<00:05:51.490> this<00:05:51.639> one<00:05:51.819> out<00:05:52.029> if

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
sure about trying to dig this one out if

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.920 
sure about trying to dig this one out if
it<00:05:52.779> was<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:52.960> bit<00:05:53.169> smaller<00:05:53.499> you<00:05:53.889> can<00:05:54.689> have<00:05:55.689> a<00:05:55.719> go

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
it was a bit smaller you can have a go

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.739 
it was a bit smaller you can have a go
like<00:05:56.229> this<00:05:56.469> put<00:05:56.740> your<00:05:56.860> knife<00:05:57.069> down<00:05:57.099> and

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:57.749 
like this put your knife down and

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.540 
like this put your knife down and
remember<00:05:58.749> it's<00:05:58.990> got<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.169> long<00:05:59.439> tap<00:05:59.800> root<00:06:00.069> about

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
remember it's got a long tap root about

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.029 
remember it's got a long tap root about
as<00:06:00.849> long<00:06:01.060> as<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.300> knife<00:06:01.509> blade<00:06:01.779> so<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.680> want

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
as long as the knife blade so you want

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.769 
as long as the knife blade so you want
it<00:06:03.159> you<00:06:03.310> could<00:06:03.460> put<00:06:03.639> your<00:06:03.819> knife<00:06:03.969> down<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.569> try

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
it you could put your knife down and try

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.510 
it you could put your knife down and try
twisting<00:06:05.409> it<00:06:05.529> and<00:06:07.770> you<00:06:08.770> might<00:06:08.979> be<00:06:09.129> able<00:06:09.279> to<00:06:09.400> get

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
twisting it and you might be able to get

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.489 
twisting it and you might be able to get
it<00:06:09.639> out<00:06:09.759> if<00:06:10.029> the<00:06:10.180> soil<00:06:10.449> is<00:06:10.659> soft<00:06:10.900> like<00:06:11.080> it<00:06:11.379> is

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
it out if the soil is soft like it is

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.540 
it out if the soil is soft like it is
now<00:06:12.539> but<00:06:13.539> you<00:06:13.599> may<00:06:13.990> not<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:14.589> if<00:06:14.680> it<00:06:14.800> breaks<00:06:15.159> off

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
now but you may not and if it breaks off

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:22.950 
now but you may not and if it breaks off
I<00:06:19.830> think<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:20.979> am<00:06:21.159> gonna<00:06:21.370> get<00:06:21.550> this<00:06:21.729> one<00:06:21.939> here<00:06:22.870> we

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
I think I am gonna get this one here we

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.429 
I think I am gonna get this one here we
go<00:06:23.909> you<00:06:24.909> can<00:06:25.060> see<00:06:25.240> how<00:06:25.479> big<00:06:25.689> the<00:06:25.839> tap<00:06:26.050> root<00:06:26.289> and

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
go you can see how big the tap root and

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.189 
go you can see how big the tap root and
you<00:06:26.499> see<00:06:26.710> also<00:06:26.889> this<00:06:27.249> bit<00:06:27.520> here<00:06:27.909> now<00:06:28.120> if<00:06:29.020> the

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
you see also this bit here now if the

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.959 
you see also this bit here now if the
soil<00:06:29.469> is<00:06:29.650> dry<00:06:29.949> and<00:06:30.129> I<00:06:30.249> just<00:06:30.580> pulled<00:06:30.879> that

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
soil is dry and I just pulled that

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.659 
soil is dry and I just pulled that
instead<00:06:31.930> of<00:06:32.050> putting<00:06:32.229> the<00:06:32.379> knife<00:06:32.560> in<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:33.490> would

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
instead of putting the knife in it would

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.600 
instead of putting the knife in it would
snap<00:06:33.939> off<00:06:34.180> at<00:06:34.330> that<00:06:34.509> kink<00:06:34.810> there<00:06:35.139> and<00:06:35.469> then<00:06:36.279> it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
snap off at that kink there and then it

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.309 
snap off at that kink there and then it
would<00:06:36.879> grow<00:06:37.089> again<00:06:37.389> I<00:06:37.419> would<00:06:37.749> lose<00:06:37.960> sight<00:06:38.289> of

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
would grow again I would lose sight of

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.809 
would grow again I would lose sight of
that<00:06:38.650> stem<00:06:39.039> and<00:06:39.460> it<00:06:39.969> would<00:06:40.149> grow<00:06:40.360> again<00:06:41.819> if

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:42.819 
that stem and it would grow again if

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.300 
that stem and it would grow again if
you've<00:06:43.029> got<00:06:43.060> lots<00:06:43.389> of<00:06:43.599> seedlings<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.379> often

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
you've got lots of seedlings and often

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.070 
you've got lots of seedlings and often
there<00:06:45.490> can<00:06:45.520> be<00:06:45.759> dozens<00:06:46.300> and<00:06:46.449> dozens<00:06:46.509> of<00:06:46.930> them

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
there can be dozens and dozens of them

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.820 
there can be dozens and dozens of them
and<00:06:47.639> there's<00:06:48.639> no<00:06:48.849> reason<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:50.080> avoid<00:06:50.229> spraying

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
and there's no reason to avoid spraying

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.889 
and there's no reason to avoid spraying
herbicide<00:06:51.639> will<00:06:51.969> kill<00:06:52.270> them<00:06:52.599> when<00:06:52.719> they're

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:52.899 
herbicide will kill them when they're

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.860 
herbicide will kill them when they're
that<00:06:53.050> small<00:06:53.580> otherwise<00:06:54.580> you<00:06:55.089> can<00:06:55.270> scrape<00:06:55.629> them

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
that small otherwise you can scrape them

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.329 
that small otherwise you can scrape them
like<00:06:56.050> we<00:06:56.259> did<00:06:56.439> the<00:06:56.649> big<00:06:57.639> one<00:06:57.819> in<00:06:58.800> that<00:06:59.800> in<00:07:00.129> that

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:00.339 
like we did the big one in that in that

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.040 
like we did the big one in that in that
way<00:07:00.580> and<00:07:00.819> put<00:07:01.000> herbicide<00:07:01.449> on<00:07:01.599> there<00:07:01.810> but<00:07:02.020> we

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
way and put herbicide on there but we

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.399 
way and put herbicide on there but we
have<00:07:02.560> got<00:07:02.740> this<00:07:02.889> one<00:07:03.069> out<00:07:03.930> there's<00:07:04.930> a<00:07:04.990> stubborn

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 
have got this one out there's a stubborn

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.079 
have got this one out there's a stubborn
plant<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.889> get<00:07:06.009> rid<00:07:06.189> of<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:06.550> you<00:07:06.610> do<00:07:06.759> have<00:07:06.969> to

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:07.089 
plant to get rid of and you do have to

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.170 
plant to get rid of and you do have to
know<00:07:07.120> that<00:07:07.389> techniques<00:07:07.870> about<00:07:08.229> how<00:07:08.469> to<00:07:08.800> use

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
know that techniques about how to use

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.389 
know that techniques about how to use
glyphosate<00:07:10.259> by<00:07:11.259> scraping<00:07:11.649> the<00:07:11.860> stem<00:07:12.219> and

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:12.399 
glyphosate by scraping the stem and

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.629 
glyphosate by scraping the stem and
breaking<00:07:12.819> the<00:07:12.939> stem<00:07:13.210> further<00:07:13.569> up<00:07:13.779> the<00:07:13.930> plant

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 
breaking the stem further up the plant

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.249 
breaking the stem further up the plant
and<00:07:14.729> of<00:07:15.030> course<00:07:15.270> it<00:07:15.449> gets<00:07:15.539> rid<00:07:15.749> of<00:07:15.780> the<00:07:15.900> berries

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
and of course it gets rid of the berries

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.290 
and of course it gets rid of the berries
and<00:07:16.520> if<00:07:17.520> you<00:07:17.639> do<00:07:17.789> that<00:07:18.030> it<00:07:18.599> will<00:07:18.659> slowly<00:07:19.169> die

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
and if you do that it will slowly die

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.550 
and if you do that it will slowly die
it's<00:07:21.300> important<00:07:21.719> to<00:07:21.780> do<00:07:21.930> all<00:07:21.960> the<00:07:22.259> stems

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
it's important to do all the stems

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.100 
it's important to do all the stems
because<00:07:22.830> often<00:07:23.340> each<00:07:23.999> shrub<00:07:24.389> might<00:07:24.840> have<00:07:24.990> been

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
because often each shrub might have been

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.839 
because often each shrub might have been
cut<00:07:25.349> back<00:07:25.560> in<00:07:25.740> the<00:07:25.830> past<00:07:26.099> and<00:07:26.430> it<00:07:26.490> might<00:07:26.669> have

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
cut back in the past and it might have

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:28.610 
cut back in the past and it might have
multiple<00:07:27.029> stamens<00:07:27.749> and<00:07:27.930> you<00:07:28.050> have<00:07:28.199> to<00:07:28.319> do<00:07:28.439> each

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
multiple stamens and you have to do each

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.009 
multiple stamens and you have to do each
stem
