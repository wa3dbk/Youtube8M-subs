00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.660
 in all the Christmas stories this 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:09.759
 Santa with his reindeer to children gifts 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.790
 trees adorned with little lights 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:17.890
 colors that rather always always good 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.640
 I'm going to teach you a trick so that your 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.980
 Christmas drawings are taken with 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.830
 Attention 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.099
 in a thick cardboard we will draw a 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.890
 beautiful Christmas pine starts with the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.329
 star you have to draw triangles 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.320
 next to each other 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.800
 so if you want the pine we can also 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:46.040
 do it in the shape of triangles like 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.100
 Christmas will have many ornaments 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.360
 and the time to paint it takes a brush 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 and green paint to color the cup 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 try not to cover the ornaments 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.230
 for the central part of the green pine and 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.970
 darker 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.770
 and for the yellow trick the sky will be 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.770
 very bright blue 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.270
 now covers the floor with brown 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.749
 the star is staying great 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.850
 we will paint yellow now uses many 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:27.670
 colors for ornaments 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.280
 When the paint has dried use 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.470
 betrayals to paint lines that will give 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.680
 the feeling of brightness both in the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.680
 tree like on the floor look 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.899
 as a final detail I have drawn lines to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:50.970
 trunk with a marker to make it look like 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.970
 wood has been very nice this method 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.729
 they are surrounded by snow to achieve the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.430
 rings that is this material this makes 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.130
 to get it mixed with glue 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.750
 you'll see how realistic 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.920
 for the snow take a plastic cup 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 and that and glue in equal parts 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.860
 first put and that way with a spoon 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 very well 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.540
 and now pour the glue diaz lay 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.260
 Stir everything so that the mixture stays 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.280
 well together take another plastic bag and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.040
 pour the mixture 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.040
 do it fast so it does not harden 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.849
 effect for your cut which is one of the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.219
 tips of the bag and creates a peak 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:50.049
 Press gently and make the flakes of 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:53.329
 falling snow also make snow 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.010
 accumulated on earth and the one that remained in 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.920
 the tree 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.980
 Keep placing the mixture as if you were 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.950
 a pastry that decorates or cream 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.040
 for a little more here at the base of the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.040
 trunk 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.720
 It is becoming fabulous 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.630
 It's fascinating for real snow but 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.180
 is not present you can also apply 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.750
 this mix all the Christmas decorations 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.600
 that you can think of and draw some 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.200
 little bells and possesses snow the thousand 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.120
 demons has not thought about where it has been 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 raised hands to the work
