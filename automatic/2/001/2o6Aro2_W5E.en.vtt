00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.660
 Hi there, this is not exactly issue 43 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.980
 there will be a small anboxing like now 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.459
 fashionable to say such things are sold in 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.010
 stalls 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.010
 at a reasonable price collection of models 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.340
 called the police cars of the world 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.590
 attached 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.050
 Modelka's journal is specifically in this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:42.310
 release box for magazines gift but 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:45.820
 Now I â€™ll open it before your eyes 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.050
 let's start with modelka here she is in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.440
 such a package is a feat 238 minivan 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 apparently so it reads apparently 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.170
 nothing special below 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.800
 I wonder it seems like there is no well the packaging itself 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.780
 such 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 not particularly valuable therefore 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.979
 Now we will not particularly regret and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:14.729
 check your heroic strength to 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:18.700
 break as always it turns out not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.039
 very well well here such here again 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.200
 modelka here is rearranged because there 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.719
 not very well focused to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.429
 the model itself is better to show why not 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.709
 actual to do me a full review 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.689
 because there are still models that 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.450
 let's say well in my opinion more 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.299
 interesting and here despite the fact that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.399
 nothing opens quite good here 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.279
 some kind of elements like them 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.209
 the headlights are not so bad in my opinion 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:51.429
 wipers then fashion is present 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:54.369
 cars that I can see very well but 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.139
 that's actually why I am myself therefore I 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.139
 decided to review it does not make full 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:03.399
 because as you see it seemed you 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:05.819
 sides turned it around really show already 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.819
 nothing 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.240
 inside of it take a look too 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.200
 kinda pretty typical 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.080
 detailing 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480
 the same wheel the same seat but in general 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.050
 immediately obvious but less interesting 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.320
 of course when the model is without chips 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.709
 without opening doors and so on well 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.230
 here in the rest here means there is here 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.990
 such a box 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 police cars of the world and and yes 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.170
 apparently yes 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.790
 postponed and there can be folded 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.980
 Now I give a little full 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.850
 Growth I show this box there 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.080
 can be put 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 magazines are from cars and which will 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.890
 the following series but this I 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.530
 actually there was it in the first series 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.300
 Well, this magazine is not very big 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.000
 he's pretty pretty so small 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.959
 test information some kind of plain 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.300
 and 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.890
 each magazine has a poster on 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.870
 center poster but not a bad poster 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.209
 In principle, for the first release in general was 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.390
 for 100 rubles it was perfect but for 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.220
 200 rubles who is the principle I'm still ready 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.170
 such issues to acquire but this one to me 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.170
 donated so I did not even pay 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.200
