00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Whether on the head in the face or on the bag 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.429
 they're all over the hair 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 you only have much more experience 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:19.710
 roughly considered in this video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 hair long rolf eden the bulk 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 from keratin a father proteinen 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.300
 to view exist, we share our 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.099
 hamm ahlen two parts on the first, the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.560
 what the author looks like and secondly 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 what's in the skin is in it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.630
 the first part is called h and the second one 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.120
 hair root we start with the h 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.559
 that looks like this and consists of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 three share coca cola cortex and like the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.910
 good goalies the outer bark layer 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 of hair she is about four to five 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.469
 micrometer thick and consists of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.020
 cross-dead 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.030
 cells, the cells of the curricula are 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.680
 as well as arranged at a pine cone 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 just do not like too extreme 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.629
 the good cola protects the hair 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.489
 external chemical and physical 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.369
 influences such as light or 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
 You can read cosmetics on her 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.939
 whether the hair is healthy or not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.530
 in a healthy close are the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.049
 shed each other flat and it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 creates a smooth surface that the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.060
 light optimally reflects one has one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.520
 beautiful mane like this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 wonderful alpaca creatures at 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 sick fucked times lie the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.770
 do not shed perfect on each other and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 the light is reflected less well 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.689
 So the hair looks a bit duller and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.759
 broken as in this candidate the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.159
 Next layer is the cortex too 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.159
 fiber layer father's stem or bark 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.979
 called the cortex makes up about 80 percent 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.710
 of the year and consists of fiber 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.780
 bundle in turn consist of whole 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 fine keratin fibers you too 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.649
 fibrils called an h is therefore 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.049
 mainly from many small ones 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 keratin rule the connection between 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.439
 the individual cells of this little one 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 keratin chicken care for the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.540
 elasticity and tear resistance of the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 Hair are located inside the hair 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.039
 Then there is the third ingredient 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 namely the hag resp 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.860
 with dollars 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 This tissue substance is for the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.390
 stability and flexibility of the hair 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.070
 responsible after we know how 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.780
 the hair is built we look 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.480
 now the hair root 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.800
 At the chapel, the hair is created in the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.960
 matrix continued to evolve 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.780
 there are also the melanocytes 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.510
 They are for the color of the hair 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.550
 responsible of hck muscle directed 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.030
 the hair in cold or psychic 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.910
 influences on this include, for example 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.860
 excitement or anger causes this muscle 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.860
 So that it gives you goose bumps 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.989
 if you freeze the sebaceous glands 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.090
 ensures that the upper layer of the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.450
 hair nice fast and supple 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.770
 remains 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.750
 did you know that blondes 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.050
 on average twice as many hairs 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.300
 on the head have as redheads on 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.030
 Incidentally, one day we lose up to one day 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.410
 100 hair my god is there too 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.590
 also a genetic disease 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.590
 which leads to over hairiness 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.480
 then you end up like that when you find it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.310
 you like writes hashtag chewbacca 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.040
 where president and if not gentleman 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.970
 schneider is based on a babypopo 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.560
 the comments 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.239
 and if no piece itches or 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 interested hashtag writes it works 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.380
 I'm over the ass we hope the video

 you liked and if you still

 more about weirdness against diseases 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.650
 mutation and supernatural powers
