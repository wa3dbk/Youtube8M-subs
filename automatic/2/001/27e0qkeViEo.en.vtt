keep a PC running smoothly when you're

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
keep a PC running smoothly when you're
trying<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> keep<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.220> running<00:00:08.309> computer

trying to keep it running computer

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.709 
trying to keep it running computer
running<00:00:09.000> smoothly

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
running smoothly

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.330 
running smoothly
one<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.110> main<00:00:10.320> things<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.740> keep<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.070> mind

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
one of the main things to keep in mind

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700 
one of the main things to keep in mind
is<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.420> software<00:00:12.780> programs<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.410> there

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
is that the software programs out there

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.829 
is that the software programs out there
for<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> most<00:00:14.130> part<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:15.120> claimed<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.719> do

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
for the most part that claimed to do

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.779 
for the most part that claimed to do
that<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> speed<00:00:17.279> things<00:00:17.490> up

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
that for you or to speed things up

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.290 
that for you or to speed things up
actually<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.840> cause<00:00:19.020> more<00:00:19.380> harm<00:00:19.619> than<00:00:20.130> good

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
actually can cause more harm than good

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
actually can cause more harm than good
so<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.420> personal<00:00:21.660> recommendation<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.680> don't

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
so my personal recommendation is don't

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
so my personal recommendation is don't
add<00:00:23.670> any<00:00:23.910> software<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.449> your<00:00:24.539> computer<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
add any software to your computer that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.769 
add any software to your computer that
claims<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.099> make<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.369> faster<00:00:26.789> or<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.510> make<00:00:27.660> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
claims to make it faster or to make it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.189 
claims to make it faster or to make it
better

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
better

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
better
all<00:00:28.680> those<00:00:28.980> software<00:00:29.369> programs<00:00:29.670> end<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.000> doing

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
all those software programs end up doing

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
all those software programs end up doing
is<00:00:30.510> adding<00:00:30.960> another<00:00:31.320> step<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.859> computer

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is adding another step for your computer

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.310 
is adding another step for your computer
to<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.460> through<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> again<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.140> cause

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to go through and again it can cause

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.200 
to go through and again it can cause
more<00:00:34.530> harm<00:00:34.649> than<00:00:34.890> good

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
more harm than good

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.090 
more harm than good
the<00:00:36.210> next<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> keep<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> mind<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the next thing to keep in mind is in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
the next thing to keep in mind is in
adding<00:00:38.489> programs<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.719> might<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.170> be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
adding programs that might not be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520 
adding programs that might not be
beneficial<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:42.140> making<00:00:43.140> sure<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
beneficial to you in making sure that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
beneficial to you in making sure that
when<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> upgrade<00:00:44.100> programs<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.239> uninstall

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
when you upgrade programs you uninstall

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770 
when you upgrade programs you uninstall
the<00:00:45.989> previous<00:00:46.350> versions<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.539> for

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
software anymore then I would say

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.730 
software anymore then I would say
uninstall<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:22.170> install<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> newer

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
uninstall it and just install the newer

uninstall it and just install the newer
versions<00:01:23.360> those<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> main

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
versions those are two of the main

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.090 
versions those are two of the main
things<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> keep<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.740> computer<00:01:25.979> running

smoothly
the<00:01:27.450> next<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.049> try<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> keep<00:01:29.130> away<00:01:29.280> from

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the next is try to keep away from

the next is try to keep away from
downloading<00:01:30.150> software<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.990> keeping<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> on

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
downloading software and keeping it on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.890

your hard drive you're gonna want to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
your hard drive you're gonna want to
make<00:01:34.049> sure<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:35.060> software<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> you're

downloading if you don't need it anymore

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
downloading if you don't need it anymore
then<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.700> ahead<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.090> rid<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
then you go ahead and get rid of it but

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
then you go ahead and get rid of it but
also<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.680> internet<00:01:41.009> browsing<00:01:41.220> cache<00:01:41.579> and

history and temporary internet files

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
history and temporary internet files
keep<00:01:44.250> those<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.640> down<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> minimum<00:01:45.509> because

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
keep those all down to a minimum because

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
keep those all down to a minimum because
that<00:01:46.049> does<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.500> affect<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that does actually affect the way the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.569 
that does actually affect the way the
system<00:01:48.000> itself<00:01:48.360> runs<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:50.130> other<00:01:50.250> thing<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
system itself runs the other thing to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
system itself runs the other thing to
keep<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.820> mind<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.320> you're

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
keep in mind is that when you're

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.109 
keep in mind is that when you're
installing<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.399> software<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> first

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
installing your software for the first

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.910 
installing your software for the first
time<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.860> sure

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
time you're going to want to make sure

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.030 
time you're going to want to make sure
and<00:01:56.250> put<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.210> location<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.829> use

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and put it in a good location if you use

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.709 
and put it in a good location if you use
the<00:01:59.189> default<00:01:59.549> location<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.149> Program<00:02:00.509> Files

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the default location of Program Files

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.749 
the default location of Program Files
that's<00:02:01.439> great<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.430> Program

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that's great because all of your Program

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.940 
that's great because all of your Program
Files<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:03.270> store<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> same<00:02:04.530> directory

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
Files get store to the same directory

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.990 
Files get store to the same directory
and<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.159> easy<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.640> computer<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and it's easy for your computer to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
and it's easy for your computer to
access<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.649> software<00:02:08.009> programs

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
access if you have software programs

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.469 
access if you have software programs
that<00:02:08.489> you're<00:02:08.610> installing<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.179> different

that same note with keeping information
on<00:02:19.380> different<00:02:19.650> parts<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> hard<00:02:20.130> drive<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
on different parts of the hard drive a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280 
on different parts of the hard drive a
lot<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.270> people<00:02:21.480> tend<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.990> defragment

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
lot of people tend to want to defragment

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.560 
lot of people tend to want to defragment
their<00:02:22.740> hard<00:02:22.920> drives<00:02:23.210> my<00:02:24.210> personal

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
their hard drives my personal

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.540 
their hard drives my personal
recommendation<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.320> not<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.620> do<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.130> it's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
recommendation is not to do that it's

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.970 
recommendation is not to do that it's
like<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.390> scratch<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.830> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
like it's a scratch that you have to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.300 
like it's a scratch that you have to
etch<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.620> itch<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
etch it's like an itch that you have to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
etch it's like an itch that you have to
scratch<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:33.210> more<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> scratch<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.050> more

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
scratch the more you scratch it the more

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.050 
scratch the more you scratch it the more
you<00:02:34.290> feel<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.740> have<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.640> same<00:02:35.850> thing

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you feel like you have to the same thing

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.460 
you feel like you have to the same thing
with<00:02:36.180> defragmenting<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.140> more<00:02:37.350> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
with defragmenting the more you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
with defragmenting the more you
defragment<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.070> more<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> computer<00:02:38.790> feels

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
defragment the more the computer feels

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.610 
defragment the more the computer feels
like<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.270> have<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.510> defragment<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.170> then

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
like you have to defragment and then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.200 
like you have to defragment and then
actually<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.040> slow<00:02:41.220> your<00:02:41.370> system<00:02:41.730> down<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
actually can slow your system down I

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.390 
actually can slow your system down I
personally<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.140> never<00:02:43.380> defragmented<00:02:44.100> any

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
personally have never defragmented any

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.070 
personally have never defragmented any
of<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.850> computers<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.480> they're<00:02:45.900> running

flawlessly<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.890> very<00:02:47.400> quickly<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:48.540> I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
flawlessly and very quickly because I

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.360 
flawlessly and very quickly because I
don't<00:02:48.930> add<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.350> additional<00:02:49.770> software<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
don't add the additional software and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.800 
don't add the additional software and
don't<00:02:50.550> take<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> additional<00:02:51.209> steps<00:02:51.540> that

don't take the additional steps that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020 
don't take the additional steps that

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
will slow it down those are the main

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.910 
will slow it down those are the main
things<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.390> consider<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.990> keep<00:02:55.470> your<00:02:55.650> PC
