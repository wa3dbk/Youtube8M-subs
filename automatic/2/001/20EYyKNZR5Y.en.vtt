there<00:00:01.520> are<00:00:01.579> several<00:00:01.819> ways<00:00:02.030> of<00:00:02.240> manipulating

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:02.389 
there are several ways of manipulating

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.539 
there are several ways of manipulating
sound<00:00:03.170> on<00:00:03.350> the<00:00:03.440> timeline<00:00:03.920> and<00:00:04.100> edge<00:00:04.250> animate

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
sound on the timeline and edge animate

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.430 
sound on the timeline and edge animate
one<00:00:05.330> of<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:05.480> first<00:00:05.690> things<00:00:05.870> we<00:00:05.990> can<00:00:06.140> do<00:00:06.230> is

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
one of the first things we can do is

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.740 
one of the first things we can do is
we'll<00:00:07.100> select<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:07.610> sound<00:00:07.880> in<00:00:08.240> our<00:00:08.389> timeline

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
we'll select the sound in our timeline

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.650 
we'll select the sound in our timeline
and<00:00:09.169> we<00:00:09.950> have<00:00:10.129> several<00:00:10.429> options<00:00:10.759> here<00:00:11.089> we<00:00:11.509> have

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
and we have several options here we have

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.249 
and we have several options here we have
volume<00:00:12.280> autoplay<00:00:13.280> as<00:00:13.549> well<00:00:13.940> as<00:00:14.059> loop<00:00:14.329> right

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
volume autoplay as well as loop right

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.870 
volume autoplay as well as loop right
now<00:00:15.379> if<00:00:15.469> we<00:00:15.559> decide<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:15.889> test<00:00:16.219> our<00:00:16.400> movie<00:00:16.670> let's

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
now if we decide to test our movie let's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.320 
now if we decide to test our movie let's
do<00:00:17.000> command<00:00:17.390> return<00:00:17.750> control<00:00:18.290> enter<00:00:18.530> on<00:00:18.620> PC

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
do command return control enter on PC

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.120 
do command return control enter on PC
there's<00:00:20.330> nothing<00:00:20.780> happening<00:00:20.990> right<00:00:21.380> now<00:00:21.440> so

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
there's nothing happening right now so

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.380 
there's nothing happening right now so
let's<00:00:22.280> go<00:00:22.340> ahead<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:22.580> close<00:00:22.730> this<00:00:22.910> out<00:00:23.180> and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
let's go ahead and close this out and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.170 
let's go ahead and close this out and
let's<00:00:24.170> try<00:00:24.410> using<00:00:24.590> autoplay<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:25.880> I'll<00:00:25.970> simply

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
let's try using autoplay so I'll simply

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.750 
let's try using autoplay so I'll simply
select<00:00:26.600> autoplay

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 

not<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.120> confused<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.140> click

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
not to be confused with if I click

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
not to be confused with if I click
directly<00:00:31.770> on<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.130> stage<00:00:32.400> we<00:00:33.180> also<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.690> an

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
directly on the stage we also have an

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.480 
directly on the stage we also have an
autoplay<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> talking<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
autoplay now this is talking about the

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.150 
autoplay now this is talking about the
animation<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.690> select<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.560> sound<00:00:37.800> loop

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
animation but if I select the sound loop

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.400 
animation but if I select the sound loop
there's<00:00:38.460> also<00:00:38.760> an<00:00:39.060> autoplay<00:00:39.540> button<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
there's also an autoplay button here so

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
there's also an autoplay button here so
now<00:00:41.400> that<00:00:41.460> we've<00:00:41.670> selected<00:00:41.850> autoplay<00:00:42.720> we

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
now that we've selected autoplay we

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.150 
now that we've selected autoplay we
should<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> able<00:00:43.380> to<00:00:43.530> hear<00:00:43.650> something<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.070> we

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
should be able to hear something when we

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.990 
should be able to hear something when we
test<00:00:44.400> our<00:00:44.580> movie

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
test our movie

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760 
test our movie
it's<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.390> command<00:00:45.690> return<00:00:46.020> control<00:00:46.410> enter

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it's your command return control enter

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:58.040 
it's your command return control enter
on<00:00:46.830> PC<00:00:55.550> now<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.970> just<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.330> small<00:00:57.570> loop<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
on PC now this is just a small loop that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.350 
on PC now this is just a small loop that
I've<00:00:58.170> created<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.830> it<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.699> stops<00:01:00.000> abruptly

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
I've created and it just stops abruptly

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.540 
I've created and it just stops abruptly
because<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.080> it's<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.769> long<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.430> let's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
because well it's not that long so let's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
because well it's not that long so let's
go<00:01:02.640> ahead<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.850> close<00:01:02.970> this<00:01:03.150> out<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.559> also

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
go ahead and close this out and I also

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
go ahead and close this out and I also
want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> show<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.370> one<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.120> particular

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
want to show you one thing in particular

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.100 
want to show you one thing in particular
I'm<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.800> select<00:01:08.240> loop<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> we'll<00:01:09.840> see

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I'm going to select loop and we'll see

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
I'm going to select loop and we'll see
if<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> play<00:01:10.860> our<00:01:11.100> cat

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if this is going to play our cat

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:35.170 
if this is going to play our cat
so<00:01:12.120> do<00:01:12.240> command<00:01:12.570> return<00:01:12.900> control<00:01:13.470> enter<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.830> PC

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.820 

now<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.510> may<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.840> heard<00:01:37.050> is<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> little

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
now what you may have heard is a little

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.310 
now what you may have heard is a little
skip<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> music<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.780> trying<00:01:40.140> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
skip right where the music is trying to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.500 
skip right where the music is trying to
loop<00:01:40.530> when<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.160> initially<00:01:41.490> created<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.270> loop

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
loop when I initially created this loop

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.390 
loop when I initially created this loop
this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.930> creative<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> program<00:01:43.950> Adobe

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
this is creative for the program Adobe

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.640 
this is creative for the program Adobe
Flash<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.570> flash<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:46.080> actually<00:01:46.410> plays

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
Flash and in flash it actually plays

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.920 
Flash and in flash it actually plays
pretty<00:01:47.220> smoothly<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.630> thing<00:01:48.810> I've

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
pretty smoothly but the one thing I've

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
pretty smoothly but the one thing I've
noticed<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.410> ng<00:01:49.920> animate<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:50.580> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
noticed about ng animate is there's a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
noticed about ng animate is there's a
little<00:01:50.820> bit<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.180> skip<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.170> musics

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little bit of a skip as the musics

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
little bit of a skip as the musics
trying<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.950> play<00:01:53.100> again<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:54.330> my<00:01:54.450> suggestion<00:01:54.900> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
trying to play again so my suggestion if

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
trying to play again so my suggestion if
you're<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.800> create<00:01:55.980> a<00:01:56.280> loop<00:01:56.730> for<00:01:57.030> edge

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you're going to create a loop for edge

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.570 
you're going to create a loop for edge
animate<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.900> would<00:01:58.080> suggest<00:01:58.290> doing<00:01:58.950> something

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
animate I would suggest doing something

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.560 
animate I would suggest doing something
in<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.120> way<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:01.080> music<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:02.040> set<00:02:02.220> up<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.610> DVD

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in the way that music is set up for DVD

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
in the way that music is set up for DVD
loops<00:02:03.870> so<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.440> may<00:02:04.800> have<00:02:04.980> music<00:02:05.310> that's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
loops so you may have music that's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
loops so you may have music that's
fading<00:02:05.970> in<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.690> fading<00:02:07.170> out<00:02:07.290> over<00:02:07.650> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
fading in and then fading out over a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.009 
fading in and then fading out over a
period<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.390> now<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.599> addition<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
period of time now in addition to

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.440 
period of time now in addition to
autoplay<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> loop<00:02:11.190> I'm<00:02:11.519> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> turn<00:02:11.970> both

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
autoplay and loop I'm going to turn both

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.149 
autoplay and loop I'm going to turn both
