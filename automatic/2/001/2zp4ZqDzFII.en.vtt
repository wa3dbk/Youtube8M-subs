00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.130
 let's move on to the ingredients then how 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.700
 first ingredient a tablespoon of 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.710
 white sugar 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.320
 I don't recommend the cane one because 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.460
 the grains are thicker then for the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.960
 Our scrub bar mask is not good 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.240
 may be too aggressive for the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.419
 for the face for any type of face 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:36.079
 then half a lemon juice of half a lemon 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:39.620
 in a spoon you can decide 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.050
 I'm burning in a spoon then 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.140
 yogurt of course not mind the brand 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.030
 or any other you can use it 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.170
 plain yogurt of any other brand 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.200
 then a few drops of essential oil 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.450
 this is a monoi oil a teaspoon 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.239
 it's a plastic cup to go to 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.239
 create our scrub bar mask 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 then we begin to prepare ours 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.350
 compound in an empty glass beginning 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:30.159
 putting for the sugar then I will go to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:31.270
 show off my little you can 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.950
 use a spoonful of sugar 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:40.990
 or two Sardinians as you wish 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.670
 here is the sugar and then we go to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.009
 apply we love to apply let's go to 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.009
 put lemon juice 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:21.940
 here is our lemon juice with lo 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:24.270
 sugar we start to turn after having 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.600
 well mixed with sugar 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.060
 lemon we have just created this 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.440
 cream so let's put our own 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.980
 yogurt then pour into his yogurt 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.980
 in the compound 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:03:01.880
 and we continue to turn finally I go to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.000
 put about ten drops of oil of 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.000
 monoi 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.340
 then the mixture is ready ours 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.290
 scrub mask is ready 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.019
 obviously you can store it in fi in 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.790
 fridge for 3 4 days and you can 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.239
 also use a yes and a day 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.939
 no day 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.340
 I advise you to dose the yogurt well 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.739
 because obviously it would be a waste 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.730
 use a lot of yogo for a mask 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 so even half a jar of yogurt goes 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.319
 nothing good 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.139
 this is usually the case 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.909
 in the morning after cleaning his face at 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.070
 applied on the face for about ten 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.870
 minutes and then go and rinse 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.549
 or you can apply in the evening 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.709
 making circular movements of the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.860
 circular massages on the whole face and 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.889
 however the prague face brighter and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.580
 softer I hope this recipe 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.500
 for a face mask , it is useful 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.080
 I hope he just used them 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.650
 nothing to the next to the next i take care 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.650
 boys
