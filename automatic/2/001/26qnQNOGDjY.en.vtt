00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.220 
thirteen and a half by four by two
inches<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.460> piece<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> paper<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.270> 20<00:00:19.050> by

inches and the piece of paper is 20 by
23<00:00:19.770> inches<00:00:20.160> um<00:00:21.080> different<00:00:22.080> sized<00:00:22.380> box<00:00:22.650> use

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
23 inches um different sized box use

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.349 
23 inches um different sized box use
different<00:00:23.160> paper<00:00:23.490> obviously<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> want

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
different paper obviously but you want

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to make sure that you can wrap it all

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.620 
to make sure that you can wrap it all
the<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:30.119> long<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.510> do

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the way around and as long as you do

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.110 
the way around and as long as you do
that<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.869> should<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:31.230> able<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> okay

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
that you should be able to get it okay

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.020 
that you should be able to get it okay
um<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.899> first<00:00:33.930> step<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:35.030> have

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
um so the first step you want to have

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.569 
um so the first step you want to have
your<00:00:36.149> paper<00:00:36.360> diagonal<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
your paper diagonal like this and the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
your paper diagonal like this and the
box<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> corner<00:00:40.620> hanging

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
box like this with the corner hanging

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
box like this with the corner hanging
off<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> edge<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.540> long<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:44.329> see

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
off the edge so as long as you can see

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
off the edge so as long as you can see
it<00:00:45.480> okay<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.710> should<00:00:47.190> cover

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it okay like that it should cover

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.529 
it okay like that it should cover
properly<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.090> at<00:00:51.090> an<00:00:51.270> angle

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
properly so you have this at an angle

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.069 
properly so you have this at an angle
like<00:00:51.570> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
like that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
like that
so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.860> step<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> pull<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so the first step you pull this up here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.010 
so the first step you pull this up here
oh<00:00:54.000> you'll<00:00:54.210> also<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.539> three<00:00:54.690> beats<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
oh you'll also need three beats of the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
oh you'll also need three beats of the
tape<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> I've<00:00:56.250> turned<00:00:56.520> them<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> stuck

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
tape and I've turned them off and stuck

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.130 
tape and I've turned them off and stuck
them<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> desk<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.809> easy<00:00:57.930> access

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
them on the desk so I have easy access

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.819 
them on the desk so I have easy access
to<00:00:58.469> them

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to them

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.360 
to them
sit<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.020> step<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.559> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sit this is the first step and you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.109 
sit this is the first step and you're
going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.670> fold<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.809> side<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.439> this

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
going to fold the side in like this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to fold the side in like this
increase<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.630> corner

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
increase the corner

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.630 
increase the corner
then<00:01:09.479> holding<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.170> hands<00:01:10.640> you're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
then holding it with your hands you're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
then holding it with your hands you're
going<00:01:11.789> to<00:01:11.880> pull<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.539> on<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.590> side<00:01:13.859> and<00:01:14.100> crease

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
going to pull up on this side and crease

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
going to pull up on this side and crease
it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> lays<00:01:14.999> flat<00:01:15.420> against<00:01:15.749> the<00:01:15.929> corner

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it so it lays flat against the corner

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
it so it lays flat against the corner
you<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.859> to<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.039> sure<00:01:17.069> your<00:01:17.460> corners<00:01:17.819> are

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you want to make sure your corners are

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.539 
you want to make sure your corners are
really<00:01:18.299> well<00:01:18.569> creased<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.020> elegant

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
really well creased and elegant

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.529 
really well creased and elegant
then<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.729> place<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:20.939> first<00:01:21.299> piece<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
then you can place your first piece of

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.940 
then you can place your first piece of
tape<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:23.310> top<00:01:23.459> like<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:25.799> next

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
tape on the top like that so the next

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.649 
tape on the top like that so the next
step<00:01:26.219> use<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.579> same<00:01:26.789> concepts<00:01:27.299> you're<00:01:27.539> going

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
step use the same concepts you're going

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.449 
step use the same concepts you're going
to<00:01:27.719> pull<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.289> loose<00:01:28.560> flat<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:29.420> crease<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
to pull up this loose flat and crease it

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.219 
to pull up this loose flat and crease it
comes<00:01:32.459> acting<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.209> and<00:01:33.539> then<00:01:34.109> you're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
comes acting like that and then you're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.160 
comes acting like that and then you're
going<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.380> holding<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.819> corner

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
going to holding it here on the corner

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.839 
going to holding it here on the corner
pull<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.450> crease<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.840> again<00:01:40.759> then<00:01:41.759> you're

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
pull up and crease it again then you're

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.160 
pull up and crease it again then you're
going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> pick<00:01:42.149> up<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> ball<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.719> lay<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
going to pick up the ball and lay it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.069 
going to pick up the ball and lay it
flat<00:01:43.289> on<00:01:43.739> that<00:01:43.799> crease<00:01:44.629> go<00:01:45.629> ahead<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.869> crease

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
flat on that crease go ahead and crease

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.619 
flat on that crease go ahead and crease
this<00:01:46.289> part<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.789> or<00:01:47.789> you<00:01:47.879> can<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> box<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:48.629 
this part now or you can use the box to

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.469 
this part now or you can use the box to
push<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.039> hangs<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> edge

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
push it down if it hangs over the edge

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.209 
push it down if it hangs over the edge
like<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
like that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.010 
like that
just<00:01:53.219> pick<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:53.489> up<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.629> tuck<00:01:55.319> in<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.860> bit

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
just pick it up and tuck in a little bit

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.050 
just pick it up and tuck in a little bit
so<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:59.099> now<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.459> box<00:01:59.610> upside

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so then you now have your box upside

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.690 
so then you now have your box upside
down<00:02:00.209> from<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.569> you<00:02:00.659> started<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
down from where you started it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.249 
down from where you started it
so<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:02.849> same<00:02:03.390> concept<00:02:03.780> again<00:02:03.959> you're<00:02:04.140> going

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so then same concept again you're going

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.650 
so then same concept again you're going
to<00:02:04.319> take<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> next<00:02:04.799> corner<00:02:06.079> do<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> crease<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
to take the next corner do a crease and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.480 
to take the next corner do a crease and
pull<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.810> up

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.740 

so<00:02:16.820> take<00:02:17.030> your<00:02:17.150> left<00:02:17.330> second<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> tip

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
so take your left second to the tip

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.130 
so take your left second to the tip
Humphrey<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.700> again<00:02:23.270> same<00:02:23.480> concepts<00:02:23.900> with

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
Humphrey so again same concepts with
