00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.980
 Next time you are doing it 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.850
 If you want to finish with an inkjet printer 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.999
 This too 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.929
 It depends on the nature of the link 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.409
 So I hope the completion is good if possible 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.829
 Former Gimhae begins Ueusa's new I'm out 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.409
 So please listen to it a little tomorrow 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.280
 However, if there was a master who was justified here alone 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.640
 It is spring 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.089
 It is above 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.059
 It is almost decided to hold the paper holder while the system is 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.110
 Because 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 The members are really important 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.330
 It is an ic card that everyone took with a digital camera 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.370
 Even if I make it finish 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.140
 Unless I do the flow of the process which I went now properly 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 Not 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.300
 It is reorganization such as digital camera though 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.510
 Why do digital cameras make their own color 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.610
 Is it at the same latitude operating it on a computer 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.280
 This is because it is related 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.540
 I need to work 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.440
 But there are many of these types in between 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.370
 Well the most important thing is 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.320
 It is meaning that time has passed 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 This is where you buy 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240
 You can see if you can see Urawa 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 Mr Shito is here 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 If there is no way with this, will there be that Mt. Pictoriko 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.360
 please listen 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.100
 So what do you do when printing? 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.730
 It is an embarrassed thing 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.220
 Well really big chaplin 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.580
 It is really the third from 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.570
 This is everyone x-rite 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 There are 8 valid 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 But all come in about 25 minutes again 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.410
 This is Mr. Koji Soft 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.940
 Icc profile against paper when bankruptcy when using operation 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.170
 Because there is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.980
 It's easier than that 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.900
 It's that setting when you can beat it like Desi 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.670
 It's very long here 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.460
 It is a little trouble 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.590
 First of all 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.730
 And on the other hand 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.219
 It means that it is useless to drive a button. 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.399
 It will be troubled if it becomes so 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.739
 Do you want to listen 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.739
 I have no time and I'm getting a little 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.869
 You can see that between the islands 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.900
 This is 18 of 60 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.030
 It is written 9 days of the time among 8645 bodies, but the most important is the thigh 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.629
 Something is here 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.209
 It is a work 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.280
 Everybody went away, so I went to the printer maker 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.479
 Unusual lever absolute relative not used 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.819
 Just remember this 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.369
 And this part 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.369
 Be sure to put a color correction after 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 It is serious, everyone loses 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.309
 It doesn't mean it's an obstacle you pointed out 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.519
 6451 units of this 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.869
 I wrote in a total of 5 delivery 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.119
 Everything I said is covered in more detail 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.019
 So if you can buy 1 happen and read 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.339
 I will go to some extent 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:10.199
 Still more 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.559
 I want to do it 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.939
 If you want to make it 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.689
 The last has not reached here before 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.039
 If PENTAX is different from Sanriku 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.099
 Those who have the camera of that dram maker are also absolute 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.269
 It's okay 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.169
 If you enter here, I will know for the moment 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.719
 All things that all instructors 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.479
 Treat 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.869
 And will do it 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.719
 I think everyone is the best if I think it is good 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.099
 As I said 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.379
 Even if minicooper Li appeared 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.439
 Sasaki will soon rise 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.039
 It will be impossible 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.969
 How to run that circuit 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.139
 This is increasing 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.309
 I think that is early
