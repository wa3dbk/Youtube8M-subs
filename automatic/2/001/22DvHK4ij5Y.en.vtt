00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.370
 little fat and more when we have a 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.010
 pan like the one I have on the day of 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.990
 Today I love the idea because that's the way 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.820

 steam and do not count my food 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.190
 what is so important when I do it 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.630
 in a pot as in this case they leave me 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.460
 to catch and I do not want that they are 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.810
 cooking that are crispy when the 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.650
 people can chew them out of bread 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.200
 delicious 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.680

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.290
 rice 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.320

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.910

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.900
 example of lunch for the kids 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.060

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.460
 next the husband or you point out 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.290

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.970
 take from 11 to the chavitos is also 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.530
 a very nutritious food we have all 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.500
 we have the vegetable we have the protein 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.490
 we have the vegetable we have the serial that 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.490
 is the rice in this case 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.800
 and what I'm going to do now with my 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.800
 sauceboat 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:22.580
 I'm going to put a little bit ok and this sauce 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:27.380
 I will pass it to my guests as well 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:29.330
 so that it will be nice and I will not 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.160
 put excess vinegar details that 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.230
 can put to your liking that was so 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.870

 we are in the kitchen so long 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.180
