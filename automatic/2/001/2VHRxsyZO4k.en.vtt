00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
it's pretty easy it's not too hard at

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.220 
it's pretty easy it's not too hard at
all<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.760> thought<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.780> was<00:02:46.870> more<00:02:46.989> challenging

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
all I thought it was more challenging

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.339 
all I thought it was more challenging
than<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.680> would<00:02:47.829> be<00:02:48.629> also<00:02:49.629> back<00:02:49.989> here<00:02:50.200> you'll

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
than it would be also back here you'll

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.179 
than it would be also back here you'll
notice<00:02:51.269> some<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.390> trucks<00:02:52.689> have<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.189> storage

notice some of the trucks have a storage
compartment<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.750> remove<00:02:56.049> three<00:02:56.349> little

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
compartment you just remove three little

compartment you just remove three little
bolts<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.099> comes<00:02:57.340> out<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.030> actually

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.069 
bolts and it comes out and I actually
have<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.409> if<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.190> see<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:01.079> plastic

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
have it if you can see it a plastic

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.240 
have it if you can see it a plastic

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
just show the schematic one more time it

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:28.040 
just show the schematic one more time it
seems<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.709> clear<00:03:08.920> things<00:03:09.129> up

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050
