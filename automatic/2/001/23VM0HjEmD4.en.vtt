most first-time smartphone buyers but

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.000 
most first-time smartphone buyers but

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
actually turned out to be Android and

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.680 
actually turned out to be Android and
yeah<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.370> if<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.880> didn't<00:05:14.090> no<00:05:14.180> wonder<00:05:14.480> it<00:05:14.570> was

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
yeah so if you didn't no wonder it was

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.660

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
than iOS it's just the hype surrounding

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.600 
than iOS it's just the hype surrounding
iOS<00:05:20.930> makes<00:05:21.230> it<00:05:21.380> seem<00:05:21.590> like<00:05:21.770> iOS<00:05:22.160> has<00:05:22.340> a<00:05:22.370> bit
