a<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.620> run<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.940> top<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> hard<00:00:12.630> snow

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
a little run the top of the hard snow

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.799 
a little run the top of the hard snow
here<00:00:13.380> while<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:13.950> still<00:00:14.160> hard<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.450> 40

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
here while it's still hard it's about 40

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
here while it's still hard it's about 40
degrees<00:00:16.080> outside<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.800> kind<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> start

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
degrees outside so it's kind of start

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.769 
degrees outside so it's kind of start
melting<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> soft<00:00:17.970> since<00:00:18.270> we're<00:00:18.420> gonna<00:00:18.570> do

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
melting and soft since we're gonna do

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.380 
melting and soft since we're gonna do
this<00:00:18.840> real<00:00:19.050> quick<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.789> love<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.150> thing<00:00:21.330> so

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this real quick so I love this thing so

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.840 
this real quick so I love this thing so
far<00:00:21.930> no<00:00:22.890> problems<00:00:22.920> with<00:00:23.490> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
far no problems with it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.970 
far no problems with it
the<00:00:24.300> biggest<00:00:24.600> problem<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.619> right<00:00:25.830> here

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the biggest problem is this right here

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.689 
the biggest problem is this right here
which<00:00:26.099> isn't<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.519> major<00:00:27.029> problem<00:00:28.699> see

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
which isn't really a major problem see

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
which isn't really a major problem see
how<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> spring<00:00:30.599> itself<00:00:31.019> comes<00:00:31.560> off<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
how the spring itself comes off of the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.340 
how the spring itself comes off of the
lower<00:00:32.430> mount<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.450> that's<00:00:33.960> from<00:00:34.170> high

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
lower mount on here and that's from high

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.170 
lower mount on here and that's from high
jumps<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.950> whatever<00:00:35.280> these<00:00:35.550> Springs<00:00:35.880> don't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
jumps or whatever these Springs don't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
jumps or whatever these Springs don't
have<00:00:36.780> much<00:00:37.020> tension<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.559> them<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
have much tension on them you see that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
have much tension on them you see that
moving<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.700> finger<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> fix<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.350> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
moving my finger and fix it like that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.400 
moving my finger and fix it like that
very<00:00:41.010> easily<00:00:41.629> that's<00:00:42.629> why<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> keeps<00:00:43.230> popping

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very easily that's why it keeps popping

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.549 
very easily that's why it keeps popping
off<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.399> me<00:00:44.550> maxed<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.559> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
off on even with me maxed out on the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
off on even with me maxed out on the
adjuster<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:47.760> why<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> said<00:00:48.239> before

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
adjuster here that's why I said before

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.790 
adjuster here that's why I said before
these<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.910> really<00:00:50.910> small<00:00:51.149> Springs

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
these are kind of really small Springs

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
these are kind of really small Springs
spring<00:00:52.800> rate<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> these<00:00:53.449> for<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> weight<00:00:54.660> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
spring rate on these for the weight of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.410 
spring rate on these for the weight of
the<00:00:54.840> car<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.230> all<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:55.980> they're

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
the car and all that and I think they're

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.660 
the car and all that and I think they're
they're<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.690> long<00:00:57.899> enough<00:00:58.399> this<00:00:59.399> side

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
they're just not long enough this side

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.770 
they're just not long enough this side
doesn't<00:00:59.850> seem<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> issue

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
doesn't seem to really have the issue

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260 
doesn't seem to really have the issue
but<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> side<00:01:01.559> keeps<00:01:01.890> popping<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.000> no

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but this side keeps popping out but no

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
but this side keeps popping out but no
bent<00:01:03.570> components<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.290> broken<00:01:04.559> components<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
