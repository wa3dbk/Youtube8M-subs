ability to sort by any of those things

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.289 
ability to sort by any of those things
anymore<00:02:28.079> it's<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.760> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> get

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
anymore it's because we kind of get

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.449 
anymore it's because we kind of get
confusing<00:02:30.810> you'd<00:02:31.079> have<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.859> group<00:02:32.099> swear<00:02:32.280> by

confusing you'd have this group swear by
something<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.909> then<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.180> group<00:02:33.389> sort<00:02:33.569> about

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
something and then this group sort about

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.440 
something and then this group sort about
something<00:02:34.079> else<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.939> that<00:02:36.269> kind

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.699 
size of document the arranged by name
it's<00:02:51.389> kind<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.720> most<00:02:51.870> useless<00:02:52.139> out<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.590> all

it's kind of the most useless out of all
of<00:02:52.739> them<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.129> basically<00:02:53.400> gives<00:02:53.609> you<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> view

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
of them it basically gives you a view

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.970 
of them it basically gives you a view
looks<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.810> you're<00:02:55.079> not<00:02:55.260> arranged<00:02:55.739> them<00:02:55.919> in

cool things about arranged by is I can

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.690 
cool things about arranged by is I can
go<00:03:12.959> into<00:03:13.109> column<00:03:13.650> view<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.400> could<00:03:14.579> still

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
go into column view and I could still

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.059 
go into column view and I could still
use<00:03:14.909> arranged<00:03:15.629> by<00:03:15.870> even<00:03:16.139> though<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> can't<00:03:16.590> sort

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
use arranged by even though I can't sort

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.490 
use arranged by even though I can't sort
in<00:03:17.250> column<00:03:17.549> view<00:03:17.699> I<00:03:17.879> can<00:03:18.510> say<00:03:18.780> arranged<00:03:19.229> by

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
in column view I can say arranged by

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.860 
in column view I can say arranged by
kind<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.329> see<00:03:21.419> that<00:03:21.449> columns

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
kind and you can see that columns

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.379 
kind and you can see that columns
arranged<00:03:22.109> by<00:03:22.229> kind<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.010> then<00:03:23.250> select<00:03:24.120> a

arranged by kind if I then select a
folder<00:03:25.049> here<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.979> let's<00:03:26.220> find<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.849> folder<00:03:27.060> with

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
folder here and let's find a folder with

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.420 
folder here and let's find a folder with
stuff<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.229> you<00:03:28.409> can<00:03:28.590> see<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.040> calms

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
stuff in it you can see that that calms

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.270 
stuff in it you can see that that calms
also<00:03:30.000> arranged<00:03:30.510> by<00:03:30.840> kind<00:03:31.139> so<00:03:31.799> then<00:03:31.949> I<00:03:31.979> can<00:03:32.159> even

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
also arranged by kind so then I can even

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.099 
also arranged by kind so then I can even
go<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.819> arrange<00:03:33.209> by<00:03:33.449> say<00:03:33.979> sighs<00:03:34.979> and<00:03:36.019> then<00:03:37.019> it

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
go and arrange by say sighs and then it

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.129 
go and arrange by say sighs and then it
will<00:03:37.199> arrange<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.919> each<00:03:38.669> column<00:03:39.180> by<00:03:39.389> size<00:03:39.750> in

will arrange the each column by size in

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.770 
will arrange the each column by size in
there<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.889> that<00:03:41.099> could<00:03:41.579> be<00:03:41.699> useful<00:03:41.819> now<00:03:42.569> just

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
