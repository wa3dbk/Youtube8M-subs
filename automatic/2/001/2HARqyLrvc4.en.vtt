00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello me if it's the sebastian and me 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.389
 imagine today speed caps of amigo 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.389
 in front of and from the car home sharp here 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.330
 from the inventor of halligalli stands up 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.949
 the box on it and therefore find 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.710
 we also no wonder in the box 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.980
 a bell what the game is about 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 everyone gets a stack of five 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 different colored cups and it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.879
 a card is revealed on the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
 five different colors either 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.720
 next to each other or on top of each other and then 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 you have to get his cups as fast as possible 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920
 in the appropriate order 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.699
 stack each other or next to each other 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.040
 put up 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.129
 yes we can do it the fastest today 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.710
 on the bell and gets the card 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.900
 new card uncovered starts again 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.159
 and who has the most cards in the end 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.659
 if it is stacked once through 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.680
 has won the game 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.030
 yes there is to the game to say it is 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.979
 as you just noticed, great 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.769
 quick explained is therefore suitable 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.079
 wonderful as a warm-up or as a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.299
 Absacker in the player lasts round 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:12.060
 not too long in vj 10 minutes to 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.460
 a quarter of an hour is disadvantage if you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.039
 playing with children is already so that the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 usually much slower 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.840
 when stacking 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.520
 So if kids play then you should 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.649
 either children of the same age 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.539
 play with each other or you have to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.270
 switch back as an adult gear 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.969
 The material is in order is stable 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.609
 the cards are in my opinion 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.630
 Unfortunately, only a little bit are 24 of 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.070
 these cards in the box would have where 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 I can be twice as many 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.319
 the bell of the stable the speaker 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.649
 You can also stack well too 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.659
 Super 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.719
 there is still something to say 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.999
 Too bad is people who have problems 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.590
 recognizing colors, for example red 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.259
 and green tell apart 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.819
 this bit in this game is not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.649
 not a bit outside 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.429
 It is basically a prerequisite that you 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.009
 can recognize these colors and what also 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.069
 it is a bit problematic though 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.290
 to cover a card with more 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.370
 then play for two to four 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.099
 people 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.900
 then it may be that a player 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.049
 card on your head sees you first 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.370
 has to rethink how the order now 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.450
 The others are welcome 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.329
 eagerly stacking and pushing father plays 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.280
 cups a fast absacker or on heat 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.889
 it's not a game for a game round 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 with the long-lasting play one 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.939
 plays that way you can get away so fast 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.609
 also called good comes when it comes 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.680
 us in the round also a bit heavy 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.659
 play one more on the table 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.810
 Note if you somehow one 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.400
 play events from organized 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.280
 The game is wonderfully simple 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.319
 Great game craft you just have to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.829
 five differently colored trash bins 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.269
 order so does the amigo too and 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.430
 can the quasi on a bank 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.829
 put or on the table and there you can 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.269
 the visitors stacking on each other 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.010
 do not forget something from her when you 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.370
 liked the video then give us 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.840
 but please a thumbs up and me 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.500
 said we are probably in 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.579
 next year 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.579
 it will be good by then 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.659
 let's come to the final conclusion for him 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.729
 it is worth risking because of power for good 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.069
 all starcraft fans who like to sometimes 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.739
 play board games and like to 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.650
 fall back on known game mechanisms 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.359
 like for example this looks to bothered by it 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.840
 that players can fly out of that 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.810
 a relatively high proportion and easy 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.919
 like your friends sometimes not only 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.169
 go from the screen to the gargle 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.849
 want to show who many 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.840
 but also at the mansion 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.840
 play classic circle
