00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.860 
later usually the time's right and hit
by<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> claw<00:02:27.270> nobody<00:02:28.270> wants<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> get<00:02:28.630> hit<00:02:28.780> by

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
by the claw nobody wants to get hit by

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.300 
by the claw nobody wants to get hit by
the<00:02:28.930> claw<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:31.540> demeaning<00:02:31.990> got<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.920> last<00:02:33.100> hit

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.850 
the claw it's demeaning got the last hit
I<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> last<00:02:34.150> hit<00:02:34.450> was<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:35.620> no

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
I think that was the last hit was it no

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.430 
I think that was the last hit was it no
because<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.520> wasn't<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.930> was<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.290> know<00:02:39.010> oh<00:02:40.440> mr
