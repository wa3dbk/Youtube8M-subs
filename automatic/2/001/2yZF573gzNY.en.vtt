give<00:01:17.820> me<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.970> break<00:01:18.150> maybe<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.110> would

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
give me a break maybe that one would
have<00:01:19.380> worked<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.740> me<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> break<00:01:20.580> the
