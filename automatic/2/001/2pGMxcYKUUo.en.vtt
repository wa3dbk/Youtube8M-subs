00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
girls I believe this is the last one of

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.259 
girls I believe this is the last one of
the<00:02:49.650> cell<00:02:49.829> phone<00:02:49.950> stop<00:02:50.310> shooting<00:02:50.519> me<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.970> and

the cell phone stop shooting me bit and

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.710 
the cell phone stop shooting me bit and
yeah<00:02:52.109> surprisingly<00:02:53.010> enough<00:02:53.549> it's<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
yeah surprisingly enough it's in the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.750 
yeah surprisingly enough it's in the
exact<00:02:55.200> same<00:02:55.500> spot<00:02:55.799> as<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.370> wasn't<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> first

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
exact same spot as it wasn't the first

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
exact same spot as it wasn't the first
so<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.720> entirely<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:59.250> south<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.760> we

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so it's entirely just south of the we

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.629 
so it's entirely just south of the we
feel<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.569> take<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.409> hotel<00:03:01.829> you<00:03:01.950> land<00:03:02.280> here<00:03:02.370> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
go for gates and over here it shouldn't

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.039
