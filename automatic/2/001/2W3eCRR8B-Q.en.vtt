00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all and hear so I hope that 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.040
 you're fine because I'm fine 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.109
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.110
 new video of this drone so how 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 customize his drone so a little the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.089
 first you will need a drone with 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.560
 two different pieces the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.470
 different colors so I took 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.750
 another white drone so I had that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 under the hand of the coup I took this drone 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.539
 and I detached and what is this so it's 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 exactly the same as the red 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.980
 so when very first have tasks 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.700
 them and nice so if we detach a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 right front propeller it will take a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 right front propeller also a good 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 obviously otherwise it's not going to do it so 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.840
 that to make this rendering there so in fact you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.250
 just have to take it off you just have to 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.030
 to shoot that just takes off and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 after your clips now know what we 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.360
 tell you that we can really where the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 tasks and even the rear hull of the drone 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.559
 so we can detach and m another 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.370
 like but sorry for the quality 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.650
 I was attached to both 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.299
 and good taste it will give on rendering there 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.500
 so we can change the missing canca 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.229
 so the helmet the head and just everything 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.750
 simply attract and after we crunch 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.399
 lips and well it will give results on 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.920
 so it does not hurt so me 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.380
 I had only white and go so there's some 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.479
 blue too or at worst you can 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.229
 to paint downright beautiful cock 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.590
 so that can blue yellow could the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:40.390
 to make multicolored so here it is 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.700
 pretty well pretty well even and well he 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.289
 steals both even though I've changed 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 I leave so we can change even 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.040
 the cat sic just below your 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.760
 rowling spyder so against it will require 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 screwdrivers so for that it takes 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.720
 near you turn so you can too 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.860
 customize yours by painting them 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.540
 different colors avoid putting 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 things on the wheels because it's going to do 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 a little bit of course and as there is 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.209
 not a lot of 2 me on it's funny 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.120
 it'll slow down 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.970
 so that will make the shot total and franck 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.030
 do not hesitate also go to the website of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.250
 at parrot so who sell parts 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.250
 are all parts are changeable 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.000
 on this drone so the rolling spyder idem 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.400
 for the jumping seconds and there you have 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.180
 all bouffard colors created 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.769
 three so there is that blue red and 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.590
 white and you have engines of 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.400
 different ads and hard words do not 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.000
 are not the when colors there are just 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.879
 the roosters 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.040
 so here I am finished for this video and 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.359
 we say we are next to ah for everything 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.359
 same smart video
