00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello to all of you I hope that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.000
 you are fine 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.480
 challenge so a challenge to a drawing so that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 will oppose sina to the senate at 1 is a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:35.969
 web portal in 10 5 10 6 3 10 6 against 1 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.219
 yop goes back to 10.6 in chievo 2 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.800
 cents they are all two levels 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.800
 of blood and so the fight should be 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 unroll normally should be enough 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 tight I think because there is when 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 even very high level on each side 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 so it hits both sides so the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 panda preferred to repel yap rotted 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.600
 technician melee and beat the yop 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.750
 simply has the choice of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 get closer then here is the panda wasta 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.700
 which simply prevents the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.110
 iop hand-to-hand the panda so that's 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 already a good point because otherwise if not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 the yang will be obliged already good of a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.780
 first the first side and side it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.299
 will be obliged israel will be penalized because he 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.970
 can not melee then there it 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.610
 kills the web portal because during the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.520
 stay apart because simply 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 only block his strike force 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.350
 so suddenly he lost a trick created 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.350
 the pr nawal this heap while it cost 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.070
 to pandas that only 4 pm probably king 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.060
 so his shot from afar 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.439
 in the panda because at the body level to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 body there is not much strength of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.439
 strikes against the group that has when 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.189
 even a huge punching power 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.810
 so we'll see how he manages 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.270
 up then 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.390
 the barrel that is quite useful which 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.880
 heals a lot then what does he 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 is still a shot of time I think 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.959
 here is a cartridge 1110 quite huge 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:25.190
 not boosted so suddenly the panda goes 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.360
 typing is going to wear so never a blow of 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.989
 melee at 600 which is enough 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.680
 huge is going to wear and will surely type 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.060
 this is an explosive puddle so I 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.030
 think he'll run away he'll take 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.510
 the highway not even I think it 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.220
 would have been nice so there the iop does not 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.190
 should type I think with my daughters 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.950
 because yeah so that's enough 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:01.750
 tight 1200 points of life on both sides 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:04.700
 almost so it's going to be pretty tense 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.319
 then the panda taking back his barrel 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.349
 for that name not even in that pulls me 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.090
 believe that it will shoot 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.700
 here it is abused anyway because 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.540
 it can still attracted its own 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.090
 allies then I think our panda is going 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.870
 try to play from afar and llop himself 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.870
 bring closer together 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.720
 so what will he do 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.519
 is he going to make a precipitation think 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.639
 no I think he's going to be past his 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.459
 turn or just be doing the 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.989
 precipitation but in any case it can 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.540
 enjoy its vitality that will last 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:47.420
 four rounds then unless the panda 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.130
 profit for oxen he has he goes the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.260
 lose and so on less 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.790
 so there always the same fate a breath 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.040
 alcoholic to repel our offer 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.680
 and I think they're still going to shoot 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.400
 once again so this city where you 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.500
 see that here it is 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.300
 find here our past yop to big 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.050
 thing 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.470
 setting aside will spend his tricks good or 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:20.500
 we type once so there he is a 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.850
 little blocked he's not playing so much here 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.210
 what does that because he knows he has 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.750
 lost 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.980
 no yeah so that's going to be pretty 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.050
 complicated for him to the point I think 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.950
 this he will have to song precipitation and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.950
 hit twice 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.060
 oh no he's going to type that once there 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.160
 the breath alcoholic paris I think 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.760
 that he will repeat the will repeat the combo 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.440
 so 300 which is pretty huge 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.380
 again 220 so still it's okay 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.440
 to be the same 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:01.730
 oh no ok he'll take the opportunity to heal 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.570
 a choice that he positioned himself that makes 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:09.080
 a lot of damage 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:12.670
 we can see 220 then holds the iop I 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.670
 think he's going to make a vitality 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.940
 or so how is it going but it's 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.770
 not win positively product to place 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.910
 it's enough he has a little in survival mode 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.740
 unlike the pandas who those who 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.840
 heal with the body 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:37.820
 body or just where his barrel 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:42.560
 so there vitality like I had like 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:47.470
 I said and I think he'll go to 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.470
 body we will take back his head 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.780
 1 he goes the oxen so yes well 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.970
 play 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.880
 oh yeah so that's good normally 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.480
 the block should lose its vitality and 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:06.080
 so die so that's 10 g and that's the 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.550
 victory tsingtao victory with a 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.610
 fight that will have lasted six minutes 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.800
 close in eight rounds this is a fight 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.830
 nice enough i thank both
