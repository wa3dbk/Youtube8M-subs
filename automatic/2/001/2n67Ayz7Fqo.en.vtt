00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
which most of them I was sure they will

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
which most of them I was sure they will
but<00:00:22.830> didn't<00:00:23.369> expect<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.210> give<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

but didn't expect from them to give up a
blackberry<00:00:25.230> talent<00:00:25.740> which<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.550> Opie<00:00:27.000> for

master<00:03:01.220> Eva's<00:03:01.730> arms<00:03:02.150> which<00:03:02.420> deals<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.870> bonus

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
master Eva's arms which deals a bonus

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.410 
master Eva's arms which deals a bonus
auto<00:03:03.440> attack<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:04.400> will<00:03:04.640> actually<00:03:04.940> cause

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
auto attack that will actually cause

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.200 
auto attack that will actually cause
some<00:03:05.690> pressure<00:03:05.990> but<00:03:06.620> still<00:03:06.890> fire<00:03:07.250> damage<00:03:07.670> that

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
some pressure but still fire damage that

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.150 
some pressure but still fire damage that
means<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.660> will<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:09.050> affected<00:03:09.470> by<00:03:09.590> resistance

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
means it will be affected by resistance

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.430 
means it will be affected by resistance
so<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.640> will<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:11.090> disadvantage<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.990> PvP

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
so this will have a disadvantage in PvP

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800 
so this will have a disadvantage in PvP
