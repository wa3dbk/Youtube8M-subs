00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.960
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.760
 this tutorial today I want you 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.619
 let's show you how to redesign your pc 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.429
 I could put that in the whole 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:20.050
 vmware I simulate badly 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.539
 movie can when I with my pc 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.080
 has to record and with a camera 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.519
 and do not want to setup system like that 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.630
 Looking good would not be so good too 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.910
 would recognize yes we start the whole 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.989
 just where I always very important if 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.170
 So you have to restart a pc 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.000
 and then you have to either watch what 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.199
 down in the bios is what buttons 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.109
 you have to press set up to come 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:56.550
 normal is f12 it depends on me now 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.550
 also when starting f12 has started 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 Spears here something different and 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.840
 Now I'm already in the windows 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.530
 setup for windows 7 is coming again 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.800
 a selection window from where a bios 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.410
 the buden should normally bios expensive 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.350
 always from the hard disk because system 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.380
 it is there he can become you 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.130
 probably now 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.770
 disk drives and probably 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 usb sticks displayed and then you have to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.820
 if you will have a usb drive 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.350
 wanted to install usb stick select 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.210
 and if the whole make the drive 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.980
 is every drive select and then 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.550
 I'm already coming to the windows 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.540
 I'm straight 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.250
 there is currently used setup that should 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.250
 also go reasonably fast 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.300
 so far we are strictly further 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.430
 Depending on what system they wanted to put 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.980
 So the steps are fundamental 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.170
 at no matter what operating system on 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.410
 wanted to make a pc so that's all 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.510
 the same and it now has to change the 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.700
 here at windows 7 the whole thing is something 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.470
 more modern at xp it still all in 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.789
 blue yellow and yes now we have ours 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.710
 Choose a language 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.820
 that has method 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.300
 keyboard language continues now 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.780
 to install 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.840
 then the set up book will be started like that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.290
 Now we have this window and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 let's accept that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.030
 license terms and so on 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.160
 now here again the order and upgrade 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.500
 once the option that custom 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.150
 close 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.520
 update means if you have windows 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 vista you can easily upgrade 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.580
 but I do not recommend that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.070
 system to make space act 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.760
 operating system always the better 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.700
 alternative is better solution 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.560
 here are your partition or yours 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.500
 hard disk nobody free memory the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.240
 see total size 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.790
 then select your hard drive if he does 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.400
 still us data on it are always click from 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.700
 animals can easily format as well 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.700
 not hurt 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.740
 and then you can continue here 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.640
 click and it starts directly at windows 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.390
 to install 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.280
 everything now takes in any case 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 his time at this point and with it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.340
 finished is then advise and the pc still 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.290
 will start once again an again more 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.900
 ask some individual things like eg 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.960
 Take the user you want 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 possibly a password to the key where that 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.410
 You do not necessarily have to be with the qi 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.500
 You can jump on that too 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.090
 Enter the following 30 days or 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 even then it does not feed me that 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.960
 but with a message yes then 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.670
 something comes back to the home network 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.110
 but that's all relatively high 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:06.940
 important for the connection of 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.850
 alone manufactures that was it first 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.980
 in any case, if you are 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
 then stop pc starts and in the bios since 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.750
 try the efta ssten 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 if you can not do it with f12 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.010
 otherwise works sometimes 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.500
 use remove 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.550
 no i always in bios from there can 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.920
 you then also the boot order 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.360
 to change 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.430
 yes I hope I could with this 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.280
 video help everything depending on it comes 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.820
 anyway self-explanatory and yes to the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.820
 next time
