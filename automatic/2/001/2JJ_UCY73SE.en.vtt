doodle god our place is playing at the
rural<00:01:54.659> God<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> I'm<00:01:56.009> combining<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.579> different

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
rural God so I'm combining the different

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
rural God so I'm combining the different
elements<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.299> presented<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.770> each<00:01:58.770> time

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
elements I'm presented with each time

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
elements I'm presented with each time
you<00:01:59.070> combine<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.430> element<00:02:00.030> successfully<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you combine it element successfully and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.300 
you combine it element successfully and
not<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.680> elements<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.579> reliability<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:04.310> you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
not all elements and reliability and you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
not all elements and reliability and you
get<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> new<00:02:05.729> element<00:02:06.090> which<00:02:06.600> came<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:06.840> on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
get a new element which came out on

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
get a new element which came out on
group<00:02:07.350> sometimes<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.099> combined<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.489> other

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
group sometimes be combined with other

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460 
group sometimes be combined with other
things<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.750> also<00:02:09.899> combine<00:02:10.140> elements

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
things you can also combine elements

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.949 
things you can also combine elements
together<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.489> themselves<00:02:11.959> occasionally

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
together with themselves occasionally

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
together with themselves occasionally
but<00:02:13.140> most

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but most

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.190 
but most
you<00:02:14.459> saw<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.540> game<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.810> quite<00:02:18.900> interesting

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you saw the game is quite interesting

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.020 
you saw the game is quite interesting
and<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.890> logic<00:02:20.280> used<00:02:20.519> for<00:02:20.700> combining

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and that the logic used for combining

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.520 
and that the logic used for combining
elements<00:02:21.800> sometimes<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:24.530> actually

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
elements sometimes it's actually

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.710 
elements sometimes it's actually
something<00:02:25.739> based<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.519> vague<00:02:27.090> scientific

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
something based on vague scientific

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750 
something based on vague scientific
principles<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.980> sometimes<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.459> based<00:02:29.640> on

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
principles and sometimes it's based on

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.190 
principles and sometimes it's based on
punning<00:02:30.269> or<00:02:32.209> other<00:02:33.209> sort<00:02:33.599> slightly<00:02:34.019> silly

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
punning or other sort slightly silly

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.369 
punning or other sort slightly silly
concept<00:02:34.519> so<00:02:35.519> there's<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.480> always

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
concept so there's you have to always

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.720 
concept so there's you have to always
try<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.799> tune<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> whatever<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
try and tune in to whatever the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640 
try and tune in to whatever the
developers<00:02:39.239> mindset<00:02:40.080> was<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> day<00:02:40.620> that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
developers mindset was on the day that

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.960 
developers mindset was on the day that
they<00:02:40.920> were<00:02:40.980> thinking<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.519> these<00:02:41.670> different

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
they were thinking at these different

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.990 
they were thinking at these different
combinations<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.400> I'll<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.700> also<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
combinations and I'll see it's also the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.220 
combinations and I'll see it's also the
downside<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.390> sometimes<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.110> think

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
downside that sometimes you can think

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.500 
downside that sometimes you can think
combinations<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.010> should<00:02:47.640> work<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:48.299> won't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
combinations that should work that won't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.530 
combinations that should work that won't
creations<00:02:48.959> develop<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.410> sort<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.890> them<00:02:50.540> all

taxi<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.849> working<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.360> could<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:07.560> that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
taxi with working on it could be so that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.430 
taxi with working on it could be so that
suggested<00:03:08.190> ash<00:03:08.660> which<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.840> me<00:03:09.959> seems<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.319> a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
suggested ash which to me seems like a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880 
suggested ash which to me seems like a
combination<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.950> fire<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.700> dust<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.890> indeed

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
combination of fire and dust and indeed

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.610 
combination of fire and dust and indeed
it<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.989> that's<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.230> nice<00:03:16.379> little

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
it is and so that's a nice little

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.020 
it is and so that's a nice little
feature<00:03:16.709> means<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.430> do<00:03:17.609> get<00:03:17.760> stuck

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
feature means if you do get stuck

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.580 
feature means if you do get stuck
there's<00:03:18.480> always<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:18.750> forward<00:03:19.049> let<00:03:19.319> any<00:03:19.440> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
there's always a way forward let any of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.379 
there's always a way forward let any of
us<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.829> little<00:03:20.069> timer<00:03:20.340> that's<00:03:20.790> counting

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
us this little timer that's counting

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.910 
us this little timer that's counting
down<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.019> wait<00:03:22.170> between<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.829> so

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
down you do have to wait between it so

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.580 
down you do have to wait between it so
you<00:03:23.010> can't<00:03:23.190> hit<00:03:23.340> your<00:03:23.549> way<00:03:23.639> over<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.590> yeah

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you can't hit your way over it yeah

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.410 
you can't hit your way over it yeah
that's<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.489> all<00:03:26.700> there<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.180> game

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
that's not all there is in this game

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.759 
that's not all there is in this game
otherwise<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.019> would<00:03:28.109> just<00:03:28.139> be<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.380> same<00:03:28.620> as

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
otherwise it would just be the same as

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.220 
otherwise it would just be the same as
the<00:03:28.799> flash<00:03:29.069> version<00:03:29.569> there's<00:03:30.569> also<00:03:30.720> some

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the flash version there's also some

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.900 
the flash version there's also some
little<00:03:31.470> side<00:03:31.650> quests<00:03:32.359> now<00:03:33.359> these<00:03:33.630> quests<00:03:34.500> are

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
little side quests now these quests are

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.509 
little side quests now these quests are
basically<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> same<00:03:36.239> game<00:03:36.540> as<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:37.370> good<00:03:38.370> main

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
basically the same game as a good main

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.520 
basically the same game as a good main
game<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:38.910> with<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> very<00:03:39.209> specific<00:03:39.450> aim<00:03:39.900> rather

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
game but with a very specific aim rather

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.289 
game but with a very specific aim rather
than<00:03:40.739> giving<00:03:40.980> four<00:03:41.489> elements<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.970> start<00:03:42.209> with

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
than giving four elements to start with

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.000 
than giving four elements to start with
and<00:03:42.450> gradually<00:03:42.750> building<00:03:43.049> up<00:03:43.200> you're<00:03:43.709> given<00:03:43.950> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
and gradually building up you're given a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.250 
and gradually building up you're given a
very<00:03:44.220> broad<00:03:44.849> set<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.239> different<00:03:45.720> elements<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
very broad set of different elements to

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.809 
very broad set of different elements to
begin<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.680> with<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> aim<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.609> creating

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
begin with with the aim of creating

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.659 
begin with with the aim of creating
specific<00:03:48.590> categories<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.799> items<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.609> this

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
specific categories of items so in this

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.240 
specific categories of items so in this
case<00:03:50.849> you're<00:03:51.000> trying<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> create<00:03:51.299> virtues<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
case you're trying to create virtues to

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.589 
case you're trying to create virtues to
counterbalance<00:03:53.250> Sims<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:53.880> won't<00:03:54.239> actually<00:03:54.419> go

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
counterbalance Sims I won't actually go

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.059 
counterbalance Sims I won't actually go
through<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.900> but<00:03:55.139> just<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.769> can<00:03:55.829> see<00:03:55.889> you

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
through this but just so you can see you

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.009 
through this but just so you can see you
start<00:03:56.340> with<00:03:56.459> some<00:03:56.579> very<00:03:56.700> different<00:03:57.120> elements

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
start with some very different elements

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.520 
start with some very different elements
here<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:59.810> siphon<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.870> quest<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.260> also

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
here and siphon the quest is also

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.699 
here and siphon the quest is also
minigames<00:04:01.950> these<00:04:02.700> are<00:04:02.849> interesting<00:04:03.269> in<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
minigames these are interesting in the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.370 
minigames these are interesting in the
first<00:04:04.709> glance<00:04:04.980> they<00:04:05.220> are<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:06.049> clones<00:04:07.049> of

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
first glance they are just clones of

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.309 
first glance they are just clones of
generic<00:04:08.099> puzzle<00:04:08.400> games<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.169> is<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
generic puzzle games so this is a

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.250 
generic puzzle games so this is a
standard<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:11.040> would<00:04:11.250> be<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.819> guess<00:04:12.569> most

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
standard this would be I guess most

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.800 
standard this would be I guess most
closely<00:04:13.680> related<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.910> think<00:04:14.970> two<00:04:15.359> columns

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
closely related to I think two columns

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.319 
closely related to I think two columns
except<00:04:16.500> rather<00:04:16.769> than<00:04:16.950> matching<00:04:17.459> items<00:04:17.940> you're

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
except rather than matching items you're

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.849 
except rather than matching items you're
trying<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.780> combine<00:04:19.049> them<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:19.590> you're

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
trying to combine them so you're

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.159 
trying to combine them so you're
matching<00:04:20.599> elements<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.750> would<00:04:21.959> combine

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
matching elements that would combine

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.709 
matching elements that would combine
together<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.800> as<00:04:23.219> you<00:04:23.340> saw<00:04:23.520> there<00:04:23.659> they<00:04:24.659> can

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
together and as you saw there they can

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.300 
together and as you saw there they can
actually<00:04:24.930> stack<00:04:25.289> multiple<00:04:25.500> times<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.099> if<00:04:26.219> you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
actually stack multiple times so if you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.460 
actually stack multiple times so if you
combine<00:04:26.729> them<00:04:26.909> into

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
combine them into

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.110 
combine them into
you<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.040> combine<00:04:28.280> two<00:04:28.430> blocks<00:04:28.760> into<00:04:28.970> an

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
you if you combine two blocks into an

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.700 
you if you combine two blocks into an
element<00:04:29.390> which<00:04:29.510> then<00:04:29.720> combines<00:04:30.200> into<00:04:30.440> another

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
element which then combines into another

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.260 
element which then combines into another
in<00:04:31.100> Italy<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.490> could<00:04:31.700> combine<00:04:31.940> with<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
in Italy it could combine with the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.260 
in Italy it could combine with the
element<00:04:32.600> below<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.900> it'll<00:04:33.740> chain<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.310> it's

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
element below it it'll chain and it's

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.770 
element below it it'll chain and it's
actually<00:04:35.570> quite<00:04:35.660> a<00:04:35.750> nice<00:04:35.960> little<00:04:36.230> mode<00:04:37.780> one

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
actually quite a nice little mode one

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.420 
actually quite a nice little mode one
downside<00:04:39.140> is<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.740> presentation<00:04:40.280> isn't

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
downside is that the presentation isn't

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.450 
downside is that the presentation isn't
great<00:04:40.670> for<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.930> they<00:04:42.680> drop<00:04:43.070> a<00:04:43.100> bit<00:04:43.310> too

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
great for it and they drop a bit too

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.820 
great for it and they drop a bit too
fast<00:04:43.700> when<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.000> swipe<00:04:44.380> because<00:04:45.380> they<00:04:45.500> move<00:04:45.680> in

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
fast when you swipe because they move in

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.430 
fast when you swipe because they move in
a<00:04:45.950> tile-based<00:04:46.460> movement<00:04:47.090> jerk<00:04:47.720> tile<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.290> tie

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
a tile-based movement jerk tile to tie

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.530 
a tile-based movement jerk tile to tie
rods<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.040> screw<00:04:49.670> short<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.090> dropping<00:04:50.860> nanhai

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.660 
rods and screw short of dropping nanhai
so<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.410> only<00:04:54.860> looks<00:04:55.100> like<00:04:55.160> thing<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.520> this

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
so I it only looks like thing and this

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.730 
so I it only looks like thing and this
is<00:04:55.820> only<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:56.060> minigame<00:04:56.480> is<00:04:56.720> not<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.470> core<00:04:57.710> of

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
is only a minigame is not the core of

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.840 
is only a minigame is not the core of
the<00:04:57.860> game<00:04:58.570> but<00:04:59.570> yes<00:04:59.840> they<00:05:00.020> could<00:05:00.080> it's<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
the game but yes they could it's the

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.160 
the game but yes they could it's the
presentation<00:05:02.360> isn't<00:05:02.480> brilliant<00:05:02.750> on<00:05:03.020> this

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
presentation isn't brilliant on this

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.380 
presentation isn't brilliant on this
part<00:05:03.440> however<00:05:03.980> as<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.610> game<00:05:04.850> it's<00:05:05.030> still<00:05:05.210> quite

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
part however as a game it's still quite

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.910 
part however as a game it's still quite
compelling<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.050> got<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.500> added<00:05:06.620> charge

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
compelling and it's got the added charge

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.200 
compelling and it's got the added charge
that<00:05:07.220> you've<00:05:07.310> always<00:05:07.760> got<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.970> try<00:05:08.120> and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
that you've always got to try and

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.840 
that you've always got to try and
remember<00:05:08.270> what<00:05:08.600> combinations<00:05:09.440> you<00:05:09.530> can<00:05:09.650> make

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.580 

so<00:05:13.850> yeah<00:05:14.060> it's<00:05:14.720> a<00:05:14.780> welcome<00:05:14.960> addition<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.440> the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
so yeah it's a welcome addition to the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.080 
so yeah it's a welcome addition to the
game<00:05:15.740> it's<00:05:16.070> also<00:05:16.190> worth<00:05:16.340> noting<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.760> do<00:05:16.940> not

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
game it's also worth noting you do not

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.390 
game it's also worth noting you do not
unlock<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.810> mini-games<00:05:18.170> well<00:05:19.040> I'll<00:05:19.190> show<00:05:19.310> you

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
unlock the mini-games well I'll show you

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.470 
unlock the mini-games well I'll show you
the<00:05:19.520> other<00:05:19.640> one<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.820> second<00:05:20.150> you<00:05:20.300> don't

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
the other one the second you don't

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.110 
the other one the second you don't
unlock<00:05:20.810> them<00:05:21.050> until<00:05:21.650> within<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.460> game<00:05:22.610> within

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
unlock them until within the game within

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.000 
unlock them until within the game within
the<00:05:23.300> main<00:05:23.450> game<00:05:23.660> you've<00:05:23.930> invented<00:05:24.230> the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
the main game you've invented the

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.000 
the main game you've invented the
relevant<00:05:25.640> games<00:05:26.000> which<00:05:26.900> makes<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.740> bit<00:05:27.919> of

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
relevant games which makes it a bit of

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.580 
relevant games which makes it a bit of
internal<00:05:28.400> logic<00:05:28.520> logical<00:05:29.390> sense<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.840> can<00:05:30.440> see

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
internal logic logical sense I can see

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.020 
internal logic logical sense I can see
that<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:30.919> get<00:05:31.010> far<00:05:31.220> enough<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:31.490> level<00:05:31.760> up<00:05:31.820> and

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
that you get far enough you level up and

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.270 
that you get far enough you level up and
and<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:33.290> all<00:05:33.410> tournament<00:05:33.680> games<00:05:33.860> until<00:05:34.160> I

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
and you all tournament games until I

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.060 
and you all tournament games until I
think<00:05:34.520> chapter<00:05:35.030> 3<00:05:35.660> or<00:05:35.990> chapter<00:05:36.380> 4<00:05:36.620> of<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.890> game

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
think chapter 3 or chapter 4 of the game

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.110 
think chapter 3 or chapter 4 of the game
um<00:05:37.750> which<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:38.870> just<00:05:39.020> a<00:05:39.550> well<00:05:40.550> over<00:05:40.790> 100

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
um which is just a well over 100

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.250 
um which is just a well over 100
elements<00:05:41.300> into<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.750> game<00:05:43.120> so<00:05:44.120> it's<00:05:45.020> not

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
elements into the game so it's not

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.230 
elements into the game so it's not
something<00:05:46.130> you'll<00:05:46.370> get<00:05:46.490> straight<00:05:46.700> away<00:05:46.940> you

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
something you'll get straight away you

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.690 
something you'll get straight away you
can<00:05:47.900> also<00:05:48.050> see<00:05:48.290> here<00:05:48.530> this<00:05:48.650> is<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:48.860> the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
can also see here this is a the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.120 
can also see here this is a the
bejeweled<00:05:50.770> equipment<00:05:52.419> lb<00:05:53.419> it<00:05:53.710> again<00:05:54.710> with<00:05:54.979> the

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
bejeweled equipment lb it again with the

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.860 
bejeweled equipment lb it again with the
element<00:05:55.610> combining<00:05:56.210> rather<00:05:56.720> than<00:05:56.840> element

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
element combining rather than element

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.300 
element combining rather than element
well<00:05:59.870> it's<00:06:00.110> not<00:06:00.200> really<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.530> even<00:06:01.100> though<00:06:01.160> its

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
well it's not really it even though its

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.680 
well it's not really it even though its
title<00:06:01.790> in<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:01.880> way<00:06:02.000> which<00:06:02.150> should<00:06:02.300> be<00:06:02.390> joined

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
title in the way which should be joined

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.800 
title in the way which should be joined
to<00:06:03.260> a<00:06:03.290> saucy<00:06:03.560> one<00:06:03.830> riffing<00:06:04.430> off<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:05.419> jewel<00:06:05.600> the

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.940 
to a saucy one riffing off the jewel the
controls<00:06:06.140> don't<00:06:06.320> really<00:06:06.470> work<00:06:06.590> in<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.830> same

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
controls don't really work in the same

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.409 
controls don't really work in the same
way<00:06:07.010> as<00:06:07.310> you're<00:06:07.460> not<00:06:07.550> swapping<00:06:07.910> elements

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
way as you're not swapping elements

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.600 
way as you're not swapping elements
around<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:09.620> all<00:06:09.770> you<00:06:09.860> try<00:06:10.010> to<00:06:10.070> match<00:06:10.250> three<00:06:10.520> of

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
around and all you try to match three of

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.340 
around and all you try to match three of
course<00:06:10.790> but<00:06:11.030> you're<00:06:11.240> actually<00:06:11.570> pushing<00:06:12.229> them

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
course but you're actually pushing them

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.670 
course but you're actually pushing them
into<00:06:12.440> another<00:06:12.979> which<00:06:13.940> arises<00:06:14.210> me<00:06:14.479> I<00:06:14.560> got<00:06:15.560> to

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
into another which arises me I got to

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.040 
into another which arises me I got to
say<00:06:15.860> I<00:06:16.180> expected<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.240> to<00:06:17.390> work<00:06:17.419> like<00:06:17.750> bejeweled

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
say I expected it to work like bejeweled

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.380 
say I expected it to work like bejeweled
where<00:06:18.260> you'd<00:06:18.380> switch<00:06:18.760> elements<00:06:19.760> around<00:06:20.030> and

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
where you'd switch elements around and

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.200 
where you'd switch elements around and
then<00:06:20.780> they<00:06:20.960> would<00:06:21.190> combine<00:06:22.190> with<00:06:22.550> any<00:06:22.700> nearby

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
then they would combine with any nearby

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.600 
then they would combine with any nearby
ones<00:06:23.570> which<00:06:23.780> would<00:06:23.900> have<00:06:24.410> made<00:06:24.560> sense<00:06:24.830> as<00:06:25.040> it

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
ones which would have made sense as it

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.200 
ones which would have made sense as it
is<00:06:25.729> it<00:06:26.440> so<00:06:27.440> this<00:06:27.470> simplifies<00:06:28.220> you<00:06:28.880> just<00:06:29.060> have

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
is it so this simplifies you just have

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.140 
is it so this simplifies you just have
to<00:06:29.360> spot<00:06:29.570> any<00:06:29.810> adjacent<00:06:30.260> and<00:06:30.710> then<00:06:31.700> switch<00:06:31.940> can

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
to spot any adjacent and then switch can

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.180 
to spot any adjacent and then switch can
combine<00:06:32.479> and<00:06:32.960> then<00:06:33.229> again<00:06:33.530> if<00:06:33.710> they<00:06:33.890> combine

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
combine and then again if they combine

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.320 
combine and then again if they combine
into<00:06:34.370> something<00:06:34.700> that<00:06:34.729> can<00:06:34.880> then<00:06:35.150> combine

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
into something that can then combine

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.480 
into something that can then combine
within<00:06:35.750> it<00:06:35.990> neighboring<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:36.830> it'll<00:06:37.220> do<00:06:37.310> it

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
within it neighboring and it'll do it

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.279 
within it neighboring and it'll do it
automatically

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
automatically

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.670 
automatically
and<00:06:39.129> see<00:06:40.089> bubbly<00:06:40.719> it's<00:06:40.809> quite<00:06:40.990> simple<00:06:41.229> but

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
and see bubbly it's quite simple but

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.119 
and see bubbly it's quite simple but
they<00:06:42.189> had<00:06:42.279> welcome<00:06:42.610> additions<00:06:43.289> and<00:06:44.289> on<00:06:44.919> top<00:06:45.099> of

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:45.129 
they had welcome additions and on top of

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:47.339 
they had welcome additions and on top of
