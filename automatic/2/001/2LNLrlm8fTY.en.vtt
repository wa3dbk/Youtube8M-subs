00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.509
 the law 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.969
 I imagine that to be thinking what I do 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.740
 with fruit and in the dining room good today 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.110
 let's do something also decoration 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.269
 but as with food I confess them 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.490
 I love cooking I want to teach them or 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.890
 show them that also with food 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:31.999
 we can decorate a lot as they should 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:34.160
 know it and that we can do it today a 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.500
 crib for baby although you do not believe it 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.360
 food with that roll that I walk from villava 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.160
 in baby shower because I went to the bug because 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.070
 you see my mom and the truth was I did 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.110
 a divine thing in the watermelon and there was a 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.460
 baby inside a crib that after 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.710
 I found out that the intellectual author 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.630
 female that by the way a kiss 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.910
 strict thank you I loved the idea 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.130
 that my mom came out very bad then 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.140
 I said obama the truth I want to teach him 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.150
 everyone how to make this crib what 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.550
 first you need is your knife 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 what are you going to do you are going to mark a type 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.740
 rectangle 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.009
 the mind a little bit at a time to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.250
 they just mark it here and they start 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.500
 here it goes a little bit bad because the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 records and the rule care that this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 so everything then we continue on the other side 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.740
 wild in the same way try 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.840
 measure it more or less then you already 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.149
 we flipped 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.509
 ok once being so switched 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.950
 knife that you have big and you do it 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.190
 deeper 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.010
 the turn 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.620
 you are feeling and ready as we feel 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.620
 that we apply a little bit 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.310
 beautiful 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.250
 ok now we can do it let's do 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 watermelon balls with that with a 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 ladle of snow or with this section 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.650
 special also for making balls 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.870
 melon and fruit 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.400
 We sell these at any store not 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.020
 look exotic and if you do not have no you 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.300
 worry nothing more bits pieces 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.040
 super young and pretty but those 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.650
 let's do it like that ok 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.590
 and we started and I show you that you have to 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.190
 go making the little ball so beautiful and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.190
 I show you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.960
 it's perfect around the corner with jazz 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.560
 then that's how it is but then 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.180
 you have your pretty now what are we going to do 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.400
 your balls that you made were the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.709
 big business you grab the one you left 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.769
 big and make tiny balls of the 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.910
 same way based back and tiny 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.910
 then you will put them here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.400
 and now what we have to do is go to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.400
 continue with the melon 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.630

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.569

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 be of the two or nothing more than one and 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.130
 as I tell you if you do not have it, it is not 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.810

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.420
 trash can here and you throw this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.420
 and the same process 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.290
 and once you have your little balls 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.340

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.700
 half 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.720

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.020

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.360
 ears or something because you put them and turn 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.280

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.840
 easy to take one of your balls and 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.590

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.800
 an ear 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.590
 which is now super easy to lay him down 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.689
 nothing else 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.320
 in the 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.220
