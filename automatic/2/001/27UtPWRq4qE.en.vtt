00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
brilliant i first tested it out using

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
brilliant i first tested it out using
some<00:00:48.960> music<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.469> i<00:00:49.530> found<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.890> island<00:00:50.370> was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
some music and i found that island was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
some music and i found that island was
finding<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.059> these<00:00:51.180> ambient<00:00:51.750> noises<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:52.199> would

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
finding all these ambient noises i would

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
finding all these ambient noises i would
have<00:00:52.410> never<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.770> heard<00:00:53.039> before<00:00:53.190> coming

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
have never have heard before coming

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.119 
have never have heard before coming
through<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> headphones<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.649> bass<00:00:55.890> response

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
through the headphones the bass response

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
through the headphones the bass response
is<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.879> deep<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.930> still<00:00:58.109> have

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
is really deep and you can still have

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.349 
is really deep and you can still have
very<00:00:58.469> clear<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.949> sharp<00:00:59.010> vocals<00:00:59.760> without<00:01:00.120> any

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
very clear and sharp vocals without any

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.930 
very clear and sharp vocals without any
clipping<00:01:00.809> or<00:01:01.020> anything<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.739> such<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
clipping or anything as such so it's a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.210 
clipping or anything as such so it's a
tick<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> audio<00:01:03.780> department<00:01:04.189> what<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
tick in the audio department what I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.469 
tick in the audio department what I
actually<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.700> more<00:01:05.880> impressed<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.240> was

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
actually was more impressed with was

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
when i was playing games i would

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.640 
when i was playing games i would
actually<00:01:07.770> pick<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> slight<00:01:09.119> hidden

actually pick up all this slight hidden

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually pick up all this slight hidden
noises<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:10.920> never<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.280> heard

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
noises that i will never have heard

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
noises that i will never have heard
before<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> games<00:01:12.390> such<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.439> sort<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799

game<00:01:14.070> sounds<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> different<00:01:15.299> clicks<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
game sounds and the different clicks and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
game sounds and the different clicks and
clacks<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.290> animals<00:01:16.619> running<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:17.009> which

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
clacks of animals running around which

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.890 
clacks of animals running around which
is<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.030> prevalent<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.630> things<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
is pretty prevalent in things like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.820 
is pretty prevalent in things like
starcraft<00:01:19.560> 2<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.070> games<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.780> sniper<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
starcraft 2 on games like a sniper to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.960 
starcraft 2 on games like a sniper to
you<00:01:23.009> could<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.250> hear<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> enemy

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
you could actually hear the enemy

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
you could actually hear the enemy
walking<00:01:24.299> towards<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> pinpointing

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
walking towards you so the pinpointing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.460 
walking towards you so the pinpointing
location<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.640> actually<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.060> good<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.390> well

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
location is actually really good as well

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.660 
location is actually really good as well
apart<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:29.070> obviously<00:01:29.250> look

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
apart from that they obviously look

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
apart from that they obviously look
pretty<00:01:29.939> cool<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.600> made<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.110> plastic

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pretty cool they are made from plastic

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 
pretty cool they are made from plastic
but<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> cheap<00:01:33.000> plastic<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.900> i

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but it's not a cheap plastic when i

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
but it's not a cheap plastic when i
first<00:01:34.229> did<00:01:34.380> pick<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.799> i<00:01:34.950> thought<00:01:35.159> they

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
first did pick them up i thought they

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
first did pick them up i thought they
were<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.700> heavy<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.799> after

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
were pretty heavy but actually after

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
were pretty heavy but actually after
using<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> little<00:01:38.520> while<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.970> notice<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
using for a little while i notice that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.880 
using for a little while i notice that
the<00:01:39.659> cushioning<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.680> good
