well be a steel chassis as far as the
the<00:04:33.639> chassis<00:04:33.909> itself<00:04:34.300> I'm<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.990> give<00:04:35.110> it

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
the chassis itself I'm going to give it

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.409 
the chassis itself I'm going to give it
a<00:04:35.259> 3<00:04:35.530> again<00:04:35.830> because<00:04:36.189> I'm<00:04:36.819> pretty<00:04:37.030> sure<00:04:37.240> this

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
a 3 again because I'm pretty sure this

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.879 
a 3 again because I'm pretty sure this
is<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.629> cheaper<00:04:37.990> great<00:04:38.199> deal<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.770> they're

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
is a cheaper great deal that they're

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.459
