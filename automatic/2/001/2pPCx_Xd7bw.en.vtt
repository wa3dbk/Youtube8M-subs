00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hello, let's go with you today 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.190
 we will unpack we will connect and we will configure 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.130
 satellite receiver t2 more accurate 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.590
 satellite shiro 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 terrestrial receiver t2 of the seleng signal 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.269
 model t-90 it goes in such a box 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.710
 we have a remote in this box 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.490
 Selenga 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 so big enough for t2 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.420
 receivers because usually now they 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 everyone goes small so big way 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 don't make this box big 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 long console ok that's 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 directly receiver itself 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 here we have a 5 volt power connector 1 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.360
 and 5 amps and here we have 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.090
 and usb under the flash drive behind us 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.830
 antenna fap antenna output from she 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.370
 continue to connect some device 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:01.300
 hdmi output and three bells video 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 audio left right then we have a set 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.700
 there is this cord bells with need 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.320
 connect old tv about new 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.560
 it is desirable to purchase hdmi connector 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 directly power supply 5 volts 2 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.110
 ampere and such book with warranty 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.780
 coupon let's connect connect it 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.210
 I'll go to the asus monitor first 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.360
 We connect necessary and if you have 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.820
 bell and turn on the bell then 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:42.119
 connect antenna me antenna with 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:44.680
 the amplifier now immediately appeared my 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.490
 the monitor detected something connected 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.170
 every 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:56.200
 and turn on the power connector power connector 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.750
 and the device on our screen I see that already 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.290
 appeared saleen gato 2 point ru 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.850
 but everything on the device caught fire green 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:12.010
 little light here it is from below and 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.010
 channel 3 channel so this receiver was already 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.580
 set up let's go let's do a reset before 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.580
 factory settings 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.980
 so menu go to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.409
 entertainment regions figure settings from 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.409
 return to factory settings press ok 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.239
 I have not set a password 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:57.579
 maybe the halls let's check all the zeros 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.599
 sometimes by default all zeros means everything 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.760
 reset occurred 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.920
 Duster first turn you have 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.169
 Here is such a status as a splash guide for 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.079
 installation language everywhere leave Russian 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:10.180
 do not search channels 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.609
 The receiver clock scans all frequencies and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.310
 if everything is normal with your quality 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:20.169
 reception then he must find all 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930
 multiplexes that you have available 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:26.829
 I have two multiplexes available, he will find 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.379
 20 channels and 3 radio channels possible 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.359
 Such a situation that will find 10 channels 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.430
 either the first multiplex channel here 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:38.010
 cool star of the second multiplex reason 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.199
 in this bad signal everything but view 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.819
 multiplex go on different frequencies 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.609
 receiver start your antenna catches one 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.720
 the frequency is better for another one is worse too 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.909
 it happens often 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.250
 if the antenna without an amplifier accounted for 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.780
 experiment with the local situation 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.780
 antennas so she caught 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.750
 both multiplexes at a time this happens 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:06.500
 then the first multiplex by the second teplex 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.500
 all here he found everything i press the menu button 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.480
 to skip for some reason does not respond 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.370
 I do not have to lie on the menu button 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.940
 I will because he and save the setting 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.820
 let's wait for him to search 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.830
 channels quickly searches 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.870
 channels, that is, the processor he already has 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.840
 and such as went on the first models of others 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.540
 manufacturers 3 times faster all here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.390
 he saved now shows us that 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.400
 signal level 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.730
 98 88 that is a good level 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.610
 signal with no interruption 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:55.170
 reception will not raid found us a channel and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:59.250
 complex click it all shows 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.560
 great tv small for more 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.720
 big TV raise this picture 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.630
 will still be as strong let's go into the menu 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.560
 let's look at the my settings and at it 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.110
 standard 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.360
 about all similar devices on 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.810
 other manufacturers here 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.930
 edit channel and program guide 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.630
 channel sorting change on 20 channels 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.150
 it is not relevant all exit exit under 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.580
 menu image that is, you can change 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.220
 the aspect ratio of that channel which 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.630
 you are watching 16 by 9 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:38.220
 16:09 pal secam four to three xbox 4 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.050
 approx 3 pons can take full screen four 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.900
 to three wide screen 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:47.160
 it should be auto cars are not here 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.850
 here on this receiver is missing 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:56.280
 setting so format signal tempo semi 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.500
 transparency of menu 10 so we leave for 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.740
 next level channel search i.e. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.150
 Here is a manual search if you do not have everything 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.160
 channels found you can 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.190
 You can enter in the manual search 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.920
 channel frequency channel staff but world 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.720
 and it is already specifically look for 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.810
 experiment with power quality 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.810
 signal 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.540
 now come out on a sublevel above and there is 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.260
 you can build the time difference on 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:29.180
 the receiver although the Moscow region wrote 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.280
 time zone defined correctly plus 7 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.550
 since summertime sleep mode 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.180
 let's move on setting the menu 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.620
 can choose subtitles 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.600
 digital sound system 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.420
 heavenly control eat sometimes ask 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.130
 factory setting reset ourselves did 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.900
 device information set 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:54.750
 password and update it will save if we 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.730
 turn on the USB flash drive and usb connector will be possible 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.010
 grow old photos listen to music and 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.750
 Watch the video file from it either 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.360
 write to her 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:11.010
 those programs that we want to write and 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:14.820
 look later then all this 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:18.290
 us receiver selengy 390 thanks everyone for 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.290
 attention everyone good luck for now
