00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.160
 I'm demonstrating the day off. 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.690
 than the diaphragm has that in my 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.279
 opinion is relatively small it places the 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:24.830
 engine over the flame how much this piston 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.779
 balloon is and inflates even with the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.260
 replacing what they are displaced by 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.900
 and removal of existing dead area 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.350
 inside the cylinder yet it 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 influences a lot 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.019
 if it is the purpose of the match in that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.140
 state or city council joaquim gable 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.320
 it is totally not possible for this 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.879
 project it would be necessary to make a 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.299
 will be reinforced for this reason 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.820
 you always have to press the 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.949
 forcing the air out of the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.150
 cylinder 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.629
 so it is possible to start 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.629
 initial 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.220
 here it is possible to assess the friction 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:25.350
 work connected to the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:28.960
 Crankshaft compression is also low 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.090
 because the courses are small 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.460
 now a presentation of friction without 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.400
 work option connected to the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:42.160
 crankshaft where it is possible to check 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.700
 that he stays in this back and forth before 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.560
 completely stop even achieving a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.560
 displaced person connected to iraq 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 another friction check of the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.410
 crankshaft without the steering wheel and without 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 connected to the piston displaced by it 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.890
 stay in this come and go before stopping 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.890
 for completely 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.099
 in this demonstration it is possible to verify 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.700
 as the air inside the engine was 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.420
 heated and now not if it is not under the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.859
 the air flame has returned to its state 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.139
 normal sucking option inside that 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.150
 practically does not have in air leakage 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.930
 you can see that I can not even pull 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.269
 out 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.540
 the piston thus considering a good 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.540
 essay
