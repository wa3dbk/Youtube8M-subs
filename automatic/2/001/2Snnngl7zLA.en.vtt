00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.579
 I have the impression that with friends 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 maybe people here women 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.599
 and is already sensitive to the fact that marcel 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.640
 and Quebec brand but I have 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 the impression that now women 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.780
 may not be even more sensitive to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 especially when it's been 80 years since 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.550
 it's a brand that they are they 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 for allergens without fragrance there are 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590
 really a relationship of trust that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.630
 settled down 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 marcel was developed really for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 the bones 10 6 and that I think the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 women say they look like when she 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.880
 compose use the products in a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 association that is done in one face 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.960
 known finnmark people are not crazy 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.910
 people seem known truth behind 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.390
 this camp the valence joins to have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 specific values that you do not let go 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 to be authentic to foster the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 natural beauty 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.980
 I was pretty confident that I 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.140
 am for that to defend a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.940
 thing keeping me any 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.770
 influence their turn there is a novelty 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.090
 at marcel that I really find 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 interesting that recovery really have 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.409
 also marcel's range of products 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 general joseph that it's a product 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.830
 treating even if a cosmetic product 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.940
 in May it's the baby cache dark circles 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.240
 the little crutch built into 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.120
 the application well cool mas was 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.410
 so woke up actually so instead 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.360
 to use the good old spoon 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.590
 cold 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.760
 except that this is it to find in 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 do it quickly 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.100
 all these effects the same product a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 makeup element that never leaves 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 never stopped for a very long time it's 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.880
 really the mask in the range of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 products now marcel you the twist 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.040
 next the same bros a little further 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.170
 can create 2 and so does turning 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.590
 labrosse one is able to distance or to 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 bring the hairs closer to the base of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.140
 work is to lengthen where to give 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.000
 volume we all know it's worth it 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.740
 to really develop very very early on 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.730
 as soon as possible a care routine 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.730
