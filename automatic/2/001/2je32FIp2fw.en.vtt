00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:44.570 
little allen wrench to even install them
just<00:01:34.609> cool<00:01:36.159> but<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.549> believe<00:01:37.969> there

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.760 

they<00:01:45.580> at-6<00:01:46.150> bit<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:47.140> they<00:01:47.260> smaller<00:01:47.590> than

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
they at-6 bit what they smaller than

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.320 
they at-6 bit what they smaller than
that<00:01:50.370> they're<00:01:51.370> smaller<00:01:51.730> so<00:01:51.970> that's<00:01:52.120> good<00:01:52.270> he

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
that they're smaller so that's good he

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.880 
that they're smaller so that's good he
provides<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> tool<00:01:52.900> cool

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
provides the tool cool

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.530 
provides the tool cool
so<00:01:54.100> we'll<00:01:54.310> take<00:01:54.430> apart<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.850> we'll<00:01:55.300> take<00:01:55.420> off

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
so we'll take apart the we'll take off

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.370 
so we'll take apart the we'll take off
the<00:01:55.690> old<00:01:55.720> clip<00:01:56.640> real<00:01:57.640> quick<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:59.020> my<00:01:59.200> one

complaint<00:01:59.560> about<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.070> pair<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.340> two<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
complaint about the pair of two is the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.140 
complaint about the pair of two is the
lack<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.860> deep<00:02:03.040> carry<00:02:03.280> clip<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.910> I<00:02:04.090> know

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
lack of a deep carry clip and I know

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.230 
lack of a deep carry clip and I know
that's<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.540> lot<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.840> people's<00:02:05.140> complaints<00:02:05.440> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that's a lot of people's complaints so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.650 
that's a lot of people's complaints so
this<00:02:07.240> resolves<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.570> a

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
this resolves that and this is just a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.240 
this resolves that and this is just a
natural<00:02:10.810> titanium<00:02:11.530> finish<00:02:11.710> I<00:02:11.950> don't<00:02:12.100> think

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
natural titanium finish I don't think

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.270 
natural titanium finish I don't think
these<00:02:12.340> are<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.730> almost<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.210> bronze<00:02:13.510> though<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
these are I almost like bronze though I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.500 
these are I almost like bronze though I
didn't<00:02:15.280> ask<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.670> bronzed<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.180> that's<00:02:16.360> cool

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
didn't ask to be bronzed so that's cool

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.039 
didn't ask to be bronzed so that's cool
if<00:02:16.600> he<00:02:16.630> did

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.599 

it<00:02:26.439> looks<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.709> they<00:02:26.859> might<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.040> kind<00:02:27.400> of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
it looks like they might be kind of

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.030 
it looks like they might be kind of
tricky<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.269> on<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.750> let's<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.469> we<00:02:29.620> go<00:02:29.739> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
tricky to get on so let's there we go so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.670 
tricky to get on so let's there we go so
you<00:02:30.099> kind<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.400> put<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.450> through<00:02:31.659> there<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
you kind of put that through there and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.250 
you kind of put that through there and
then<00:02:33.959> secure<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.400> first<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.870> absolutely

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
then secure that first it's absolutely

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.830 
then secure that first it's absolutely
I'm<00:02:38.319> gonna<00:02:38.500> do<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.970 

sure<00:02:43.840> screw<00:02:44.230> holes<00:02:44.469> are<00:02:44.650> lined<00:02:44.829> up<00:02:45.099> yep<00:02:45.579> there

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
sure screw holes are lined up yep there
