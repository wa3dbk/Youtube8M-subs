00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.160
 I would give you another one for a moment 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.560
 Variant show how to change colors 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.929
 can i qualify at alex tomorrow? 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.199
 seen beanies and that one ends the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.910
 round with the same mesh of the same 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.609
 mesh with the same color is still waiting 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.359
 one times short, I am now back 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.189
 in the second stitch here and makes 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.369
 the cat mesh still with the same color 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.529
 from this round and then I take 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 me the next color and make one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:41.489
 air mass and then I go into this 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.239
 mesh back here with the hook 'the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 thread this already on the hook 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 get the thread but you can see it here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 through this results in a fixed mesh and 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.739
 then crochet on with my half 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.190
 Chopsticks would do it at the next round 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.180
 then do it the same way and when you look at yourself 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 looking at the whole work of alex 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.850
 then you see that you do not have any 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.689
 Ahead and no seams to discover 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.430
 can and then let's see how 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.430
 the whole thing will look like 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.820
 if we look at it all now 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.260
 here is the vaart transition if you have the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.040
 new round with a solid mass 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.840
 So you're starting to see 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.550
 nothing you look closer if the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.700
 but maybe find it 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.910
 you do not recognize it then there is here 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 below 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:50.500
 these were the transitions 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.900
 you stab from behind in the mesh 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.470
 and the transitions here are these 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.150
 standard transitions how to dionys 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.370
 So always mesh with a chain 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.610
 So you can already see that 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.610
 clear
