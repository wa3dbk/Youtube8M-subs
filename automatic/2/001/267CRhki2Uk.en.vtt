there's<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.539> much<00:00:57.660> better<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> got

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there's just so much better so I got

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's just so much better so I got
into<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:01.230> peanut

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
into I think that they have more peanut

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.720 
into I think that they have more peanut
butter<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> them<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.550> makes

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
butter in them and that's what makes

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
butter in them and that's what makes
them<00:01:02.910> better<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.480> anyway<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> had<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> get

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
them better but anyway I had to get

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
them better but anyway I had to get
these<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.489> been<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:06.000> hard<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
these and it's been really hard not to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
these and it's been really hard not to
eat<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.260> knowing<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.950> they're<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
eat them knowing that they're in my

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.710 
eat them knowing that they're in my
closet<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.030> could<00:01:09.180> eat<00:01:09.299> them<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.570> any

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
closet and I could eat them at any

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
closet and I could eat them at any
moment<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:11.189> been<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
moment I have been really good and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:40.879 
was actually when I went to go get it it

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.270 
was actually when I went to go get it it
was<00:04:41.000> $20<00:04:41.689> and<00:04:42.050> then<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.319> bought<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.219> the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.800 
was $20 and then I bought this and the
David<00:04:43.580> sunflower<00:04:43.939> seeds<00:04:44.210> at<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.389> same<00:04:44.599> time
