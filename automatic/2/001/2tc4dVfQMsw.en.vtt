00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello here is johannes from android and 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 today we have two of the absolute 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.980
 Topseller of this year for you in the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 compare once the galaxy s 4 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.389
 samsung flagship of the year 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.510
 probably the best selling android 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 smartphones and the iphone 5 it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 brand new just appeared 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.350
 the flagship of apple even now 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.890
 already a bestseller and these two 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.470
 Let's compare that today to a powerful one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.809
 that others handy and compact that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 one of glossy plastic the other 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 with a metal body the differences 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 between the iphone 5 s and the galaxy s 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.510
 4 you can see immediately the galaxy s is 4 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.690
 the top model of samsung for the year 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.670
 2013 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.079
 It is already a few months old and has 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 since then in the smartphone market 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.250
 many millions of times have been proven 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.649
 ordered it has a plastic ball we 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 see the glittering on the back 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.969
 disco ball pattern of ram is in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 aluminum look kept though 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.660
 also plastic are the keys 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.439
 small and discreet on the side 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 housed 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.979
 the iphone 5 it's just fresh up 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 appeared on the market 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.689
 Here Apple puts his well-known 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 design language continues and has it like that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 iphone 5 already in an alu body 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 dressed it has a 4 inch display and 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 is accordingly much smaller 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 as the galaxy s 4 of the metal back 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 lets it be nice in the hand 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 at the bottom of the iphone 5 it in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.130
 two stereo speakers attached 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.320
 on the right we see the slit for the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.130
 nano are on the top is the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.259
 power button 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.380
 the volume buttons are in the usual 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.070
 iphone mannered and held 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.240
 Let's take a look now 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.549
 locking screen to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 the iphone 5 has one directly from the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.329
 lock screen access to some 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.979
 Fast function keys like us too 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 from android we can know about 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.250
 for example, the display brightness 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.790
 to adjust or to the music player 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.619
 to grab 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 with a wipe from above you get 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.729
 In addition, an overview of the current 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.040
 notifications, for example , the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.719
 weather or unlock the calendar 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 can the display either through 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.909
 push or over the fingerprint 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.190
 at galaxy s 4 we also have direct 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.890
 from the locking screen access eg on 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.140
 the camera 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.240
 Other widgets can also be found in 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.770
 hard screen will be put down by 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.660
 get a wipe from top to bottom 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.670
 we see the fast settings 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.440
 a wipe on the display unlocked 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.860
 but there are four 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.390
 other savings 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.640
 the displays show the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.460
 difference between the lcd display of the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.770
 iphone 5s and the s4 amoled display 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.630
 For our video we both have displays 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.370
 but regulated to the same brightness 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.600
 if we compare a photo directly 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.620
 look at the difference 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.570
 clear 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 the iphone 5 display is it 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.980
 altogether a little brighter that it is four 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.350
 is a bit darker time but the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 stronger saturation at the s4 one sees 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.580
 In addition, a slight green cast during 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.860
 the iphone a slight magenta sting 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.750
 So it goes into the reddish if you go 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 both phones turn a little diagonally 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.950
 you immediately see the viewing angle 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 is better overall at s4 than at 5 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.840
 there are clear in the menu guidance 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.760
 Differences in four are the apps 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.050
 arranged in the so-called appstore 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.270
 you can wipe through the 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.160
 individual pages are a tab next to it 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.050
 the widgets wipe from the top down 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.850
 below leads to the quick settings 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.860
 and to a button with the one in 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.480
 the settings menu learned the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.390
 different points are in four 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.670
 arranged by different riders 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.350
 iphone 5 it's all apps on that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.970
 homescreen you have to go left and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.250
 right between them to reach them 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.080
 as with android smartphones, there are 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.700
 folders can be drag &amp; drop here 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.799
 symbols are moved 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.810
 the settings menu looks at the iphone 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.209
 bright and clean almost as if it were from 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.030
 android all the points are here in one 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.130
 list arranged multitasking can 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.630
 both devices with the iphone one must for it 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.459
 press the home button twice 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.590
 then a view opens in the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.860
 opened apps arranged horizontally 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.350
 are 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.910
 including a small app specifically for 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.650
 You have to stay on the home for a long time 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.700
 Press button to multitask 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.260
 open view 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.680
 here the symbols are vertical 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.090
 arranged as far as the performance is concerned 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.310
 we could in our small 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.730
 everyday tests hardly a difference determined 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.590
 do 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.850
 sometimes the iphone was a bit faster 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.920
 sometimes that's four 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.210
 All in all, one can say that 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.120
 both at the same height 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.980
 but what is noticeable is scroll gestures 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.680
 processes that four it clear 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.480
 liquid than the 5 at the end of one 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.160
 must come to the Article 5 it 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.850
 about twice as often as vision 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.280
 s 4 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.230
 Finally, a few sentences to the camera 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 with the iphone 5 only one arrives directly 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.010
 from the lockscreen to the camera app im 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.080
 interface are the most important 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.320
 Functions directly available for example 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.060
 lightning on or hdr on off the camera 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.040
 the iphone is pretty people shoots 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.010
 photos without delays and is quasi 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.300
 immediately afterwards ready to start again 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.560
 even when it's four you get into the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.420
 camera directly from the lockscreen 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.430
 However, she needs a nudge 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.560
 longer to be ready to go 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.350
 Again, the camera is very fixed and 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.550
 triggers almost without delays like 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.350
 the quality of the two 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.120
 ultimately distinguishes one must 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.220
 looking at the computer screen 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.550
 in our quick check on the display 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.750
 are both almost on a par 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.210
 yes that was our little comparison 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.830
 between the galaxy s 4 and the iphone 5 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.060
 it i hope he liked you and 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.660
 you have such a small insight 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.390
 to get 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:19.170
 in the android world of galaxy and in 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.970
 the ios world of iphone yes which well 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.710
 the two are better that decides 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.630
 Ultimately, the taste for 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.640
 me is the galaxy s 4 and the big one 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.250
 advantage of the big screen 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.590
 the design with the plastic housing and 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.510
 so it's a matter of taste my thing is it 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.270
 not because of that, too, the big one for me 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.340
 advantage with the iphone in any case that 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.820
 chic alu housing and the good 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.820
 handiness
