00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
point here where the camera wants to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.499 
point here where the camera wants to
pass<00:01:28.439> through<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> wall<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
do to fix that is i'll insert a keyframe

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
do to fix that is i'll insert a keyframe
with<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.990> button<00:01:34.290> there<00:01:34.909> keyframe<00:01:35.909> comes<00:01:36.180> up

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
with that button there keyframe comes up

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.560 
with that button there keyframe comes up
here<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> ability<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
here and now i have the ability to

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
here and now i have the ability to
modify<00:01:40.189> exactly<00:01:41.189> where<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.479> camera<00:01:42.930> sits<00:01:43.439> at

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
modify exactly where the camera sits at

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.450 
modify exactly where the camera sits at
that<00:01:44.670> keyframe<00:01:45.350> it'll<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.439> animated<00:01:47.009> nicely

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that keyframe it'll be animated nicely

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.440 
that keyframe it'll be animated nicely
between<00:01:47.610> keyframes<00:01:48.259> automatically

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.969 

so<00:01:52.450> let's<00:01:52.780> go<00:01:53.049> through<00:01:53.079> the<00:01:53.350> process<00:01:53.530> of

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
so let's go through the process of

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.789 
so let's go through the process of
adding<00:01:54.220> our<00:01:54.460> own<00:01:54.670> camera<00:01:55.210> here<00:01:55.450> add<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.380> custom

adding our own camera here add a custom

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.670 
adding our own camera here add a custom
camera<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:59.520> let's<00:02:00.520> set<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> target<00:02:01.360> now<00:02:02.229> you'll

camera now let's set a target now you'll

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
camera now let's set a target now you'll
notice<00:02:02.770> I'm<00:02:03.130> not<00:02:03.159> able<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:03.610> set<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> target<00:02:04.119> or
