pound is struggling against the dollar

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.030 
pound is struggling against the dollar

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
why well last year it was 221 so every

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.619 
why well last year it was 221 so every
dollar<00:00:49.280> through<00:00:49.760> two<00:00:49.940> dollars<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:50.300> had<00:00:50.479> you

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
dollar through two dollars you had you

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.210 
dollar through two dollars you had you
got<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.809> pound<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.379> if<00:00:51.500> you're<00:00:51.650> being<00:00:51.860> paid<00:00:52.190> in

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
got a pound and if you're being paid in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.219 
got a pound and if you're being paid in
dollars<00:00:52.570> because<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.750> money<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.050> not<00:00:54.199> going

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
dollars because the money is not going

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.780 
dollars because the money is not going
to<00:00:54.350> go<00:00:54.470> as<00:00:54.589> far<00:00:54.860> now<00:00:55.250> with<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> economic

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
to go as far now with the economic

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.119 
to go as far now with the economic
crisis<00:00:56.330> that<00:00:56.479> it<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.019> pound<00:00:57.379> is<00:00:57.620> weakened

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
crisis that it is the pound is weakened

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.680 
crisis that it is the pound is weakened
against<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.489> dollar<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:59.120> so<00:00:59.420> all<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.570> a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
against the dollar and so all of a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.630 
against the dollar and so all of a
sudden<00:00:59.960> we're<00:01:00.110> seeing<00:01:00.320> at<00:01:00.440> about<00:01:00.680> around<00:01:00.949> 160

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
sudden we're seeing at about around 160

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.729 
sudden we're seeing at about around 160
now<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.479> that<00:01:02.510> means<00:01:02.870> is<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.229> if<00:01:03.559> you're

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
now what that means is that if you're

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.079 
now what that means is that if you're
paying<00:01:03.949> in<00:01:04.190> dollars<00:01:04.220> you're<00:01:04.790> going<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:04.970> earn

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
paying in dollars you're going to earn

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.760 
paying in dollars you're going to earn
more<00:01:05.299> money<00:01:05.360> when<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> exchange<00:01:06.260> rate<00:01:06.350> comes

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
more money when the exchange rate comes

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.920 
more money when the exchange rate comes
across<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.460> might<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:08.150> be<00:01:08.299> enough<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.780> pay

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
across and might not be enough to pay

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.210 
across and might not be enough to pay
off<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.200> mortgage<00:01:09.470> but<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.040> certainly

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
off the mortgage but it's certainly

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.800 
off the mortgage but it's certainly
going<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:10.610> enough<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.240> perhaps<00:01:11.420> allow<00:01:11.750> you

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
going to be enough so perhaps allow you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.200 
going to be enough so perhaps allow you
to<00:01:11.960> have<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:12.110> extra<00:01:12.470> pint<00:01:12.799> at<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.040> pub<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:14.030> a

where the higher screen resolution now
don't<00:04:06.380> forget<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.860> iphone<00:04:07.280> doesn't<00:04:07.580> have<00:04:07.790> a

diamond for example and that would make
