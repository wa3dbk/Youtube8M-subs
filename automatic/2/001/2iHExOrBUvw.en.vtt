00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.360 

now<00:00:01.050> let's<00:00:01.199> take<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> look<00:00:01.530> at<00:00:01.650> two<00:00:01.770> examples<00:00:01.920> of

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
now let's take a look at two examples of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.370 
now let's take a look at two examples of
adding<00:00:02.580> mixed<00:00:02.879> numbers<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.990> like

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
adding mixed numbers with like

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.039 
adding mixed numbers with like
denominators<00:00:05.390> the<00:00:06.390> first<00:00:06.600> step<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
denominators the first step is going to

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
denominators the first step is going to
be<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.290> write<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.589> problem<00:00:08.010> vertically

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
be to write this problem vertically

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.669 
be to write this problem vertically
lining<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.570> whole<00:00:09.750> numbers<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.410> the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
lining up the whole numbers and the

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.519 
lining up the whole numbers and the
fractions<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.059> we'll<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.420> 2<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.440> 1/6<00:00:14.420> plus<00:00:15.529> 3

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
fractions so we'll have 2 and 1/6 plus 3

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.420 
fractions so we'll have 2 and 1/6 plus 3
and<00:00:16.650> 1/6<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.350> now<00:00:19.350> we'll<00:00:19.560> add<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.770> fraction

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and 1/6 and now we'll add the fraction

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.370 
and 1/6 and now we'll add the fraction
part<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> whole<00:00:21.600> number<00:00:21.900> part<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
part and then the whole number part and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.840 
part and then the whole number part and
because<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> already<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> common

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
because we already have a common

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.790 
because we already have a common
denominator<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.289> ahead<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.560> add

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
denominator we can go ahead and add

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
denominator we can go ahead and add
these<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.220> fractions<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.150> denominator<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
these two fractions the denominator is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960 
these two fractions the denominator is
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> stay<00:00:27.990> 6<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.490> we'll<00:00:29.640> add<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
going to stay 6 and then we'll add the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.319 
going to stay 6 and then we'll add the
numerators<00:00:30.390> 1<00:00:30.990> plus<00:00:31.260> 1<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.740> equal<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.040> 2<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
numerators 1 plus 1 is equal to 2 and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
numerators 1 plus 1 is equal to 2 and
then<00:00:33.420> looking<00:00:33.630> at<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.809> whole<00:00:34.020> numbers<00:00:34.380> 2<00:00:34.649> plus

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
then looking at the whole numbers 2 plus

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.990 
then looking at the whole numbers 2 plus
3<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> equal<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> 5<00:00:37.250> now<00:00:38.250> once<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.579> determine

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
3 is equal to 5 now once we determine

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
3 is equal to 5 now once we determine
the<00:00:39.120> sum<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.870> mixed<00:00:40.140> numbers<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the sum of two mixed numbers we have to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
the sum of two mixed numbers we have to
check<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.250> two<00:00:41.399> things<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
check for two things first we want to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.420 
check for two things first we want to
make<00:00:43.200> sure<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.469> fraction<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
make sure the fraction here is in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
make sure the fraction here is in
simplest<00:00:44.789> form<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.930> also<00:00:46.079> want<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> make

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
simplest form and we also want to make

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
simplest form and we also want to make
sure<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> proper<00:00:47.370> fraction<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:48.420> an

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
sure that it's a proper fraction not an

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.840 
sure that it's a proper fraction not an
improper<00:00:49.050> fraction<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> proper

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
improper fraction this is a proper

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
improper fraction this is a proper
fraction<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> numerator<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.260> less

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
fraction because the numerator is less

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
fraction because the numerator is less
than<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> denominator<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> that's<00:00:54.360> good

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
than the denominator so that's good

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
than the denominator so that's good
but<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.590> do<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> simplify<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.670> 2<00:00:56.910> &amp;<00:00:57.090> 6

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
but we do have to simplify it 2 &amp; 6

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
but we do have to simplify it 2 &amp; 6
share<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> common<00:00:58.260> factor<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> 2<00:00:59.780> -<00:01:00.780> 6<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
share a common factor of 2 - 6 is the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.260 
share a common factor of 2 - 6 is the
same<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.399> 2<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:03.809> 2<00:01:04.110> times<00:01:04.739> 3<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.090> here's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
same as 2 all over 2 times 3 so here's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.620 
same as 2 all over 2 times 3 so here's
the<00:01:06.390> common<00:01:06.689> factor<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.080> 2<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.770> 2/6<00:01:08.630> simplifies

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the common factor of 2 so 2/6 simplifies

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.770 
the common factor of 2 so 2/6 simplifies
to<00:01:09.659> 1/3<00:01:10.650> remember<00:01:11.460> 2<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.820> 2<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.150> equal<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.479> 1

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to 1/3 remember 2 over 2 is equal to 1

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
to 1/3 remember 2 over 2 is equal to 1
these<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.830> simplifying<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> ones<00:01:14.760> they're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
these are simplifying to ones they're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.210 
these are simplifying to ones they're
not<00:01:15.180> disappearing

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
not disappearing

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.840 
not disappearing
so<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.549> equal<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> 5<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.750> 1/3<00:01:19.670> let's<00:01:20.670> take

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
so this is equal to 5 and 1/3 let's take

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.240 
so this is equal to 5 and 1/3 let's take
a<00:01:20.880> look<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> second<00:01:21.600> example<00:01:25.009> well<00:01:26.009> first

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a look at a second example well first

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
a look at a second example well first
write<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.610> vertically<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.420> we'll<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.689> 5<00:01:28.110> +

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
write this vertically so we'll have 5 +

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.080 
write this vertically so we'll have 5 +
7<00:01:28.650> eighths<00:01:29.040> plus<00:01:30.890> 8<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.220> 5<00:01:32.759> eighths

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.890 

again<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.210> already<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> common

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
again we already have a common

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.179 
again we already have a common
denominator<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.829> ahead<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> add

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
denominator so we can go ahead and add

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
denominator so we can go ahead and add
these<00:01:38.369> fractions<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> denominators<00:01:40.320> going

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
these fractions the denominators going

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.190 
these fractions the denominators going
to<00:01:40.470> stay<00:01:40.560> 8<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.270> numerator<00:01:42.479> will<00:01:42.689> be<00:01:42.810> 7

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to stay 8 and the numerator will be 7

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
to stay 8 and the numerator will be 7
plus<00:01:43.320> 5<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> equal<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> 12

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
plus 5 which is equal to 12

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.139 
plus 5 which is equal to 12
and<00:01:46.189> then<00:01:47.189> 5<00:01:47.430> plus<00:01:47.579> 8<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.000> equal<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.299> 13<00:01:48.869> now

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
and then 5 plus 8 is equal to 13 now

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.310 
and then 5 plus 8 is equal to 13 now
giving<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.420> sure<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.659> fraction<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
giving you to make sure this fraction is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
giving you to make sure this fraction is
a<00:01:52.350> proper<00:01:52.799> fraction<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.570> an

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
a proper fraction and it's not it's an

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
a proper fraction and it's not it's an
improper<00:01:55.079> fraction<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> also<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
improper fraction but it also can be

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
improper fraction but it also can be
simplified<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.540> let's<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.409> ahead<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
simplified so let's go ahead and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.330 
simplified so let's go ahead and
simplify<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.189> first<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:02.100> prime

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
simplify this first the prime

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.230 
simplify this first the prime
factorization<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> 12<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.630> 2<00:02:03.869> times<00:02:04.290> 2<00:02:04.530> times<00:02:04.560> 3

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
factorization of 12 is 2 times 2 times 3

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.999 
factorization of 12 is 2 times 2 times 3
and<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> prime<00:02:06.600> factorization<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> 8<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.740> 2

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and the prime factorization of 8 is 2

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.290 
and the prime factorization of 8 is 2
times<00:02:08.520> 2<00:02:09.030> times<00:02:09.270> 2

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
times 2 times 2

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.330 
times 2 times 2
so<00:02:10.900> notice<00:02:11.170> how<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.890> numerator<00:02:12.040> denominator

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
so notice how the numerator denominator

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.150 
so notice how the numerator denominator
have<00:02:12.820> two<00:02:13.090> factors<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.570> 2<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.020> common<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.950> this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
have two factors of 2 in common so this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.310 
have two factors of 2 in common so this
simplifies<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.750> simplifies<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
simplifies to one and this simplifies to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.810 
simplifies to one and this simplifies to
1<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.060> equal<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.590> 13<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:21.130> 3<00:02:21.580> halves

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
1 so this is equal to 13 and 3 halves

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.270 
1 so this is equal to 13 and 3 halves
but<00:02:22.720> again<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.080> can't<00:02:23.380> leave<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.860> mixed

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
but again we can't leave this mixed

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.490 
but again we can't leave this mixed
number<00:02:24.610> with<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.450> fraction<00:02:25.870> part<00:02:26.110> being<00:02:26.410> an

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
number with the fraction part being an

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.560 
number with the fraction part being an
improper<00:02:26.950> fraction<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.330> have<00:02:28.480> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
improper fraction so now we have to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.570 
improper fraction so now we have to
convert<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.900> improper<00:02:29.470> fraction<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.130> a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
convert this improper fraction to a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.640 
convert this improper fraction to a
mixed<00:02:30.640> number<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:31.840> add<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.230> 13

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
mixed number and then add it to 13

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.740 
mixed number and then add it to 13
remember<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> fraction<00:02:33.940> bar<00:02:34.180> represents

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
remember a fraction bar represents

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.920 
remember a fraction bar represents
division<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.890> 3/2<00:02:36.760> will<00:02:37.330> help<00:02:37.450> us<00:02:37.600> convert

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
division so 3/2 will help us convert

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.180 
division so 3/2 will help us convert
this<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> mixed<00:02:38.530> number

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
this to a mixed number

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.630 
this to a mixed number
well<00:02:39.640> there's<00:02:39.850> 1<00:02:40.150> 2<00:02:40.480> &amp;<00:02:40.750> 3<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> remainder

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
well there's 1 2 &amp; 3 we have a remainder

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.420 
well there's 1 2 &amp; 3 we have a remainder
of<00:02:42.760> 1<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.960> tells<00:02:44.230> us<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.530> three-halves

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
of 1 so this tells us that three-halves

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.600 
of 1 so this tells us that three-halves
is<00:02:46.420> equal<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.650> whole<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.630> one<00:02:49.630> half<00:02:50.610> so

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
is equal to one whole and one half so

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.140 
is equal to one whole and one half so
that<00:02:51.760> means<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.300> 13<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.110> three-halves<00:02:54.150> is

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
that means that 13 and three-halves is

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.220 
that means that 13 and three-halves is
equal<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.750> 13<00:02:56.590> plus<00:02:57.690> 3<00:02:58.690> halves<00:02:58.930> but

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
equal to 13 plus 3 halves but

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.120 
equal to 13 plus 3 halves but
three-halves<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.950> 1<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.310> 1/2<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.960> 13<00:03:02.620> plus<00:03:02.920> 1

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
three-halves is 1 and 1/2 so 13 plus 1

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.210 
three-halves is 1 and 1/2 so 13 plus 1
and<00:03:03.250> 1/2<00:03:03.580> would<00:03:03.970> be<00:03:04.090> 14<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.660> 1/2<00:03:05.080> which<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and 1/2 would be 14 and 1/2 which is the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.880 
and 1/2 would be 14 and 1/2 which is the
proper<00:03:06.550> way<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.730> express<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.780> sum<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.680> again

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
proper way to express this sum so again

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.670 
proper way to express this sum so again
when<00:03:12.010> adding<00:03:12.310> mixed<00:03:12.490> numbers<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:14.230> important

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
when adding mixed numbers it's important

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.260 
when adding mixed numbers it's important
to<00:03:14.740> check<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.040> make<00:03:15.160> sure<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.459> fraction<00:03:16.000> part

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
to check to make sure the fraction part

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.020 
to check to make sure the fraction part
is<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:17.440> only<00:03:17.620> simplified<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.880> it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
is not only simplified but that it's

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.180 
is not only simplified but that it's
also<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.330> proper<00:03:19.840> fraction<00:03:20.050> if<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.830> improper

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
also a proper fraction if it's improper

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.310 
also a proper fraction if it's improper
we<00:03:22.150> have<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.390> convert<00:03:22.690> it<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.959> mixed<00:03:23.050> number

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
we have to convert it to a mixed number

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
we have to convert it to a mixed number
and<00:03:23.770> then<00:03:24.370> add<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.880> whole<00:03:25.030> number
