00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
first thing you're going to want to do

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.830 
first thing you're going to want to do
is<00:00:33.770> find<00:00:33.980> one<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:34.309> download<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.000> then

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
is find one and download it and then

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.960 
is find one and download it and then
once<00:00:36.079> you've<00:00:36.260> done<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.340> next<00:00:37.370> thing<00:00:37.730> is

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
once you've done that the next thing is

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.420 
once you've done that the next thing is
to<00:00:38.180> load<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.510> into<00:00:38.600> lightroom<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:40.040> do<00:00:40.220> that

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
to load it into lightroom and to do that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.979 
to load it into lightroom and to do that
we're<00:00:40.699> going<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.850> start<00:00:41.150> by<00:00:41.420> opening<00:00:41.449> up<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
we're going to start by opening up the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.810

plugin manager under file plugin manager

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820 
plugin manager under file plugin manager
