00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.849
 very exhaustive 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 meanwhile the days later in tokyo 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.869

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.490
 us as a company 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.099
 we do not recommend because 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.099
 we are talking about the subject 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.050

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.800
 so yes we 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.229
 we think that a nail its useful life 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.589
 normal to be progressive years 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.169
 of course after two years with his decision not to be bothered 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.870
 but 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.900
 For example, the sun is very concerned about painting and making it paco 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.620
 she already 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.339
 I can do is buy a car very well operated by the sun 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.189
 by the way if the services does not leave you lying 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.360
 but everywhere 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 but not anymore and the government no longer fulfills its objective of 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.430
 of animation with budgets for the explosives that 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.050
 two years 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.690
 the inflatable police offers a graphic and visual succession that does not 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.440
 they have the radio the flyers 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.669
 the magazines there was another medium that is used in advertising campaigns 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.540
 This type of advertising medium can increase the frequency of our 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.210
 potential customers to be highly visible important feature that 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.080
 missing in many advertising campaigns 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.819
 the will make them public is a key part 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.499
 of the 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.520
 of the populations 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.589
 percent of advertising 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.520
 the most for nothing 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.830
 achieve as always 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.990
 the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.310
 but you have to learn to grow by the little that your product 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.470
 internal gross pib and quarrel sells I do not think people know it 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:44.939
 it is assumed that when 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.489
 but little lasted for that reason that times are bad or but that companies are 

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:50.879
 to cut the advertising budget which 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:51.970
 equally 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.809

 percent and that the flight 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:08.840
 but part cost will be from different means and civil after a well campaign 

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.039
 well defined

 the council means by the electoral power 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.919
 The cost of this type of advertising varies depending on the opportunities 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.919
 of sale that you will create for a particular product or service 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.419
 once defined the profile of the people 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:28.360
 that is, they burn off tension at the same time that you want to get to very little expensive 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.610
 message is sought the amount and location of the structures that best 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.750
