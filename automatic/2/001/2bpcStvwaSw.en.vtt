00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.679
 There was a question anonymous 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.049
 Survey among oncologists what they are 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.379
 if they are with themselves 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:21.380
 notice or husband wife 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.119
 child parents would be a carcinoma 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.990
 diagnosed what would they do 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 in such a case and the honest one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.880
 that's why anonymous answer was 3 percent 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.920
 the oncologist in the brd do that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.719
 Do it every day with your patients 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.940
 3 percent try 97 percent 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.420
 some other way there is belief 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 I hardly a schizophrenic professional group 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.270
 as this professional group every day 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.489
 something she does from the very inside 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.489
 knows it is wrong and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.990
 that you have to write a book as 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.750
 fictional novel actually shows only that 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.660
 we urgently need a reform of this 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.760
 need systems and a change 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.410
 I as a journalist after you say as 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.230
 someone in spain lives on this 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.800
 also say but I think that is 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.660
 the big conclusion of what you are here 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.020
 We have read here 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.370
 urgently need a reset of this system so 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.670
 it can not be the way it is right now 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.670
 go on 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.509
 your work is very strong, we have that 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.920
 just seen 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.869
 borne by scientific 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.179
 research of research results 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.319
 tomorrow we will have something to the topic 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:03.679
 hear autism and there are others 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.990
 simply still fields on which you 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.439
 I have to say something in the future 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.970
 do 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.160
 there could be that which we agree with 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.420
 has finally given a 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.780
 There are other roles to play 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:25.310
 In all cases, ask for more 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.500
 is to create that is exactly 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.019
 this oncologist will tell me sometime 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 No matter which car I drive I do not care 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.120
 which i thought or if you have one 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 paid mortgage I do that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.810
 my heart dictates otherwise 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.220
 I will also be sick because doctors are 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 statistically, have one 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.310
 life expectancy of 57 years and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.160
 Female doctors are the ones in the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.849
 female left with the highest 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.409
 suicide rate so 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:01.030
 a dramatic development or a 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:03.340
 dramatic situation and what you do 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.040
 has worn together here shows the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.159
 instruments that are alternative 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.879
 all right there we have to go 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.849
 go out 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.730
 our industry controls, so to speak, the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.870
 universities and what we unlearn 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.900
 it has to be 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.000
 There is simply no money for things and 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 industry has also done that 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.620
 smaller laboratories thrown out 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.510
 how was it done yes she did 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.950
 must pay registration fees to the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.409
 astronomical area lie 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.379
 that is, even if you tell me to do it 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.049
 now a small pharmacological company 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.370
 maybe two, maybe three 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.700
 You can not even spend millions with it 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.159
 start or can start but 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.650
 characterized that we have a phase 1 case, 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:50.739
 preclinical phase 1 desperate test 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.430
 We just can not get on with it 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.269
 My goal is now in the future 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.709
 maybe with the benedict or 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.840
 maybe another one 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.199
 form a kind of crowdfunding 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.489
 in all that is positive that is 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.930
 People are also investing money 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.250
 get back this is i want i want 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.720
 of this donation clutter down because 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
 I really want that so I want 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.500
 Also, do not touch money in yourself 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.139
 many people say that interests me 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.930
 Doing a lot somewhere, so to speak 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.699
 for the research bcdef and if that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 money is there then I can to everyone 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.940
 University not as please please 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.280
 but say to ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.259
 putting oneself down are easy 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.550
 money 12345 I want to know that like that 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.370
 works like a spinning i know 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.050
 want to know that i want it as 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.479
 to let other medications and mine 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.020
 work from here in the future is it 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:46.860
 enforce that this low the oxide 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:50.669
 as a multi instrumentalist 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.370
 is also recognized as such 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.020
 and with several steps I made 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.490
 I 'm with several doctors 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.110
 together and if other doctors too 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.180
 want to participate a lot of time open 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.800
 a small company founded where suits 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.969
 deposits are made where people simply 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.289
 help only with give the war then 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.810
 your shares or whatever he should 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.580
 I do not care about our world 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.759
 Finally, many are working 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.569
 people always say to andreas the evil 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.370
 pharmaceutical industry 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.949
 I can only say one thing to my one 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.580
 my late uncle was a fold 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.740
 very tall animal at bayer black sheep 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.370
 but I like him very much 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.900
 What are we all about? 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.590
 Bank and say yes I have mine here 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.409

 money for getting in the bank 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.779
 Bank employee says yes what should I 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.550
 want to have little or much to have 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:45.210
 say how much is opportunistic 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.770
 steps down that says i 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.319
 I'm here from the pharma industry 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.610
 okay I do I make my boyfriend for 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.419
 pharma has a lot 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.719
 profitability 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.699
 it is we ourselves who are, so to speak 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.430
 presidents and all the people of 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:04.370
 pharma industry to force this to 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.370
 Do what you do. It does not work 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:12.690
 We try this guilty law through 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.760
 opportunity first blame the school 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.730
 there is not it is just a question 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.980
 of the environment that is it environment so 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.919
 We can only say the future 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.120
 if we change the environment and we are 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.540
 own creator that we have before 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.540
 belongs 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.070
 the spirit of health congress 2015
