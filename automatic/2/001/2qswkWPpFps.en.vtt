you<00:00:14.940> guys<00:00:15.030> through<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.480> setup<00:00:15.780> process<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
you guys through the setup process I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890 
you guys through the setup process I
touch<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.520> via<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> steering<00:00:18.330> wheel<00:00:18.510> controls

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
touch up via the steering wheel controls

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
touch up via the steering wheel controls
so<00:00:19.710> basically<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.189> you're<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.550> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so basically what you're going to do is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.769 
so basically what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> use<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.119> controls<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
you're going to use the controls on the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.390 
you're going to use the controls on the
left<00:00:21.810> side<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> steering<00:00:22.890> wheel<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.279> do

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
left side of the steering wheel to do

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.279 
left side of the steering wheel to do
the<00:00:23.519> programming<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.720> program<00:00:24.960> for

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the programming we can program for

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.410 
the programming we can program for
vehicles<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:26.010> Park<00:00:26.369> Assist<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> without

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
vehicles with Park Assist and without

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.599 
vehicles with Park Assist and without
the<00:00:28.289> main<00:00:28.619> thing<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.949> always<00:00:29.340> got<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
the main thing you always got to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.950 
the main thing you always got to
remember<00:00:29.699> whenever<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.300> program<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.779> mean

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
remember whenever your program I mean

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840 
remember whenever your program I mean
anything<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> first<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
anything is to first look at the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.639 
anything is to first look at the
directions<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.420> nav<00:00:33.690> TV<00:00:33.989> includes<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
directions which nav TV includes in the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.340 
directions which nav TV includes in the
box<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.190> have<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.610> hand<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.059> here

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
box which I have in my hand right here

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
box which I have in my hand right here
the<00:00:37.350> main<00:00:37.620> key<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the main key thing I see on this is that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.280 
the main key thing I see on this is that
you<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> hold<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> buttons<00:00:40.079> down

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
you got to hold the buttons down

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.580 
you got to hold the buttons down
together<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.550> 10<00:00:41.790> seconds<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.260> basically

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
together for 10 seconds so basically

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.049 
together for 10 seconds so basically
what<00:00:43.860> you're<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:44.820> we're

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
what you're going to do is first we're

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.279 
what you're going to do is first we're
going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> programming<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
going to do the programming for the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.130

we<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.420> vehicle<00:01:27.869> should<00:01:28.080> reset<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
we do that the vehicle should reset so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.960 
we do that the vehicle should reset so
I'm<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> reach<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> steering

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I'm going to reach over the steering

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.310 
I'm going to reach over the steering
