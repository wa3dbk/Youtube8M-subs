not<00:00:21.000> talking<00:00:21.240> about<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> bass<00:00:21.660> well<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
not talking about the bass well it's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.099 
not talking about the bass well it's
gonna<00:00:22.289> sound<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.590> this

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.480 

also<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.439> too<00:00:28.890> loud<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.250> should

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
also if that was too loud you should

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.209 
also if that was too loud you should
turn<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> volume<00:00:30.150> soon<00:00:30.810> yeah<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.800> my

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
turn down the volume soon yeah well my

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
turn down the volume soon yeah well my
first<00:00:32.430> oscillator<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
first oscillator is going to be a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.970 
first oscillator is going to be a
screamer<00:00:35.780> second<00:00:36.780> oscillator<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
screamer second oscillator is going to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.850

be a mellow font and then you're gonna

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.840 
be a mellow font and then you're gonna
pitch<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> down

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
pitch that down

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
filtering for oscillator one you want it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.179 
filtering for oscillator one you want it
to<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> filter<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.070> then

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
to be all the way to filter one and then

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
to be all the way to filter one and then
from<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.759> second<00:01:30.090> oscillator<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
from the second oscillator you want to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.539 
from the second oscillator you want to
be<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> middle<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.070> nossa<00:01:32.250> maybe<00:01:32.460> you

be in the middle of a nossa maybe you
also<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> middle<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
also want this to be the middle now the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.359 
also want this to be the middle now the
filter<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> scream<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:38.159> want

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
filter one is gonna be a scream you want

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.770 
filter one is gonna be a scream you want
it<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:39.259> all<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.600> want

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it to be all the way up or the you want

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749

to<00:01:42.930> cut<00:01:43.110> off<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.409> all<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> way<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to cut off to be all the way up on the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.270 
to cut off to be all the way up on the
stream<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> around<00:01:45.689> 11<00:01:46.259> o'clock<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.799> 10:30

ish<00:01:47.460> maybe<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.780> residents<00:01:49.290> around<00:01:49.470> 2:00

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
ish maybe and the residents around 2:00

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
ish maybe and the residents around 2:00
and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:53.240> volume

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and then you're gonna want like volume

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
and then you're gonna want like volume
of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> filter<00:01:54.960> around<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.399> just

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of the filter around right here just

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.660 
of the filter around right here just
where<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.750> first<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:58.920> bar<00:01:59.490> is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
where you can see the first two bar is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.480 
where you can see the first two bar is

think<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.009> cool<00:03:56.219> is<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.729> pitch<00:03:56.939> and

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
think is really cool is the pitch and

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.509 
think is really cool is the pitch and
when<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.959> mess<00:03:58.139> with<00:03:58.229> this<00:03:58.439> I'm<00:03:59.009> gonna<00:03:59.310> take

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
when you mess with this I'm gonna take

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.259 
when you mess with this I'm gonna take
LFO<00:03:59.909> 6<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.870> put<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.769> first<00:04:02.069> on<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.790> top

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
LFO 6 and put it on the first on the top

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.469 
LFO 6 and put it on the first on the top
box<00:04:03.540> on<00:04:04.019> all<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.919> oscillators<00:04:05.459> then<00:04:06.359> you

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
box on all of the oscillators then you

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.140 
box on all of the oscillators then you
take<00:04:06.719> it<00:04:06.900> up<00:04:07.069> twelve<00:04:08.069> semitones<00:04:08.370> which<00:04:08.969> is<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
take it up twelve semitones which is a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.879 
take it up twelve semitones which is a
full<00:04:09.389> octave<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.680> once<00:04:13.680> you've<00:04:13.859> done

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
full octave and then once you've done

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.180 
full octave and then once you've done
that<00:04:14.099> for<00:04:14.250> all<00:04:14.609> of<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.789> oscillators<00:04:15.979> you<00:04:16.979> want

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that for all of the oscillators you want

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.499 
that for all of the oscillators you want
to<00:04:17.400> oh<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.789> got<00:04:18.180> an<00:04:18.239> email

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
to oh I got an email

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.620 
to oh I got an email
I'm<00:04:18.780> checking<00:04:19.229> right<00:04:19.440> now<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:20.250> on<00:04:20.449> for<00:04:21.449> the

I'm checking right now but on for the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.360 
I'm checking right now but on for the
LFO<00:04:21.989> you're<00:04:22.289> gonna<00:04:22.380> want<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.770> be<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:22.919> Down

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
LFO you're gonna want it to be a Down

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.750 
LFO you're gonna want it to be a Down

to<00:04:25.970> call<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.330> they<00:04:27.140> don't<00:04:27.320> want<00:04:27.500> sync<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.890> be<00:04:28.010> on

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
to call it they don't want sync to be on

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.640 
to call it they don't want sync to be on
and<00:04:28.540> ratio<00:04:29.540> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.960> choose<00:04:30.200> where<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.410> see<00:04:30.470> of

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and ratio you can choose where I see of

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.690 
and ratio you can choose where I see of
yourself<00:04:31.070> but<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.430> like<00:04:31.790> 1<00:04:32.120> over<00:04:32.420> 1<00:04:32.810> or<00:04:32.840> 1<00:04:33.140> over<00:04:33.170> 2

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
yourself but I like 1 over 1 or 1 over 2

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.160 
yourself but I like 1 over 1 or 1 over 2
it<00:04:34.700> should<00:04:34.760> sound<00:04:35.240> like<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.840> nays<00:04:39.020> 1

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
it should sound like this the nays 1

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.130 
it should sound like this the nays 1
over<00:04:39.410> 2<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:44.120> can<00:04:44.240> use<00:04:44.390> this<00:04:44.510> like<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.780> dubstep

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
over 2 you can use this like a dubstep

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.860 
over 2 you can use this like a dubstep
orbital<00:04:45.980> type<00:04:46.340> song<00:04:46.580> there<00:04:47.420> like<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> lecture

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
orbital type song there like a lecture

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.920 
orbital type song there like a lecture
or<00:04:48.110> whatever<00:04:48.580> but<00:04:49.580> another<00:04:50.390> important<00:04:50.840> thing

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
is the poison you're gonna want the pan

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.270 
is the poison you're gonna want the pan
position<00:04:53.120> odd<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.620> can<00:04:54.770> mess<00:04:54.920> with<00:04:54.950> that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
position odd and you can mess with that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.110 
position odd and you can mess with that
and<00:04:55.570> oh<00:04:56.950> yeah<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.010> have<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.280> have<00:04:58.490> unis<00:04:59.030> I

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
don't want to come back 16 but once you

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.010 
don't want to come back 16 but once you
move<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.590> around<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:06.410> gets<00:05:06.650> like<00:05:06.830> wider<00:05:08.020> but

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
move this around it gets like wider but

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.560 
move this around it gets like wider but
yeah<00:05:09.550> my<00:05:10.550> throat<00:05:10.790> is<00:05:10.910> killing<00:05:11.060> me<00:05:11.270> because<00:05:11.330> I'm

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
yeah my throat is killing me because I'm

yeah my throat is killing me because I'm
sick<00:05:11.810> you're<00:05:12.560> gonna<00:05:12.650> want<00:05:12.890> this<00:05:13.070> on<00:05:13.340> mono

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
sick you're gonna want this on mono

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.900 
sick you're gonna want this on mono
trait<00:05:14.090> or<00:05:14.690> mono<00:05:15.320> rotate<00:05:15.890> ya<00:05:16.160> bottle<00:05:16.580> rotate

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
trait or mono rotate ya bottle rotate

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.040 
trait or mono rotate ya bottle rotate
then<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.630> want<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:17.900> trigger<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:18.440> always<00:05:20.050> so

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
then you want the trigger on always so

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.290 
then you want the trigger on always so
like<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.980> restarts<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.670> hour<00:05:22.850> when<00:05:23.180> you

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
like that restarts this hour when you

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.790 
like that restarts this hour when you
drag<00:05:23.540> it<00:05:23.660> out<00:05:23.750> into<00:05:24.020> each<00:05:24.140> other<00:05:24.290> I'll<00:05:24.560> drag

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
drag it out into each other I'll drag

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.260 
drag it out into each other I'll drag
two<00:05:25.070> nuts<00:05:25.280> into<00:05:25.430> account<00:05:25.790> you'll<00:05:26.030> see<00:05:26.060> what<00:05:26.240> I

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
two nuts into account you'll see what I

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.850 
two nuts into account you'll see what I
mean<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:29.570> if<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:29.840> have<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.650> jaw<00:05:30.830> or

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
mean and if you have on the jaw or

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.220 
mean and if you have on the jaw or
chiller<00:05:31.220> it'll<00:05:31.880> just<00:05:32.120> continue<00:05:32.510> playing<00:05:33.170> like

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
chiller it'll just continue playing like

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.420 
chiller it'll just continue playing like
see<00:05:36.230> it<00:05:36.380> sounds<00:05:37.040> weird

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
see it sounds weird

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.750 
see it sounds weird
so<00:05:37.760> just<00:05:37.970> have<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.390> setting<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:38.840> this<00:05:39.050> I

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
so just have the setting like this I

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.880 
so just have the setting like this I
think<00:05:40.760> I've<00:05:41.120> gone<00:05:41.270> over<00:05:41.330> every<00:05:41.890> important

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
think I've gone over every important

think I've gone over every important
thing<00:05:43.070> I'm<00:05:43.340> not<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.670> hundred<00:05:43.820> percent<00:05:43.940> sure<00:05:44.210> if

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
thing I'm not a hundred percent sure if

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.060 
thing I'm not a hundred percent sure if
I<00:05:44.420> went<00:05:44.600> over<00:05:44.660> it<00:05:44.870> but<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.230> want<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.440> have<00:05:45.650> it

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
I went over it but you want to have it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.880 
I went over it but you want to have it
makes<00:05:46.280> one<00:05:46.760> and<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:48.020> mix<00:05:48.260> of<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.530> filters<00:05:48.800> you

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
makes one and the mix of the filters you
