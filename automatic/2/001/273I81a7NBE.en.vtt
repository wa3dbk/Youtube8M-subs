 10 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 hello everyone knows the meuse hd the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.460
 game that we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.320
 tutorial to do pixel art on 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.180
 minecraft or for rather transformed a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.150
 image in pixel art and after it is enough 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.250
 just count and so this is 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.349
 simple I will give you this link in the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.350
 description of the video and you can 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.589
 download minecraft pixel-art v 0.1 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.660
 point g short i'm not sure what is the 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.790
 latest version of this software but hey 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.200
 it does not matter just 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.020
 present like that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.780
 so that's finally done the creator and 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.840
 jacob of b &amp; b our debts 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.420
 so that's an author who made a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.380
 rather pretty cool software so here 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.030
 so it's simple you're going to get 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.489
 an image on the internet so for example 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.620
 google images me I take mario 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.479
 obviously you have to take a mario not 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.790
 very very complicated finally I mean 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.740
 so here for example I take one 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 here you see it's not complicated 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.110
 so I turn the aude 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 I put Mario here I am installed here 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.420
 so that's good so there you see 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.659
 we have our mario you do to picture 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.210
 you open a little thing like that 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.090
 are you going to exclude yourself mario 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 open and there you will have mario 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.420
 like that but has it for now 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 can note that these voices there it is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.439
 Mario he's cut into cubes and awesome 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.890
 but except that after you go in 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.840
 options and transforms and here and there it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.670
 you turn into cubes and so suddenly 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.770
 you most very well do a pixel art 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.189
 after you can do with full 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 other software 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.090
 I mean, excuse me dad from 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.709
 software finally I believe there is when 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.929
 even others but here I wanted to say 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.269
 full of image so good I advise you 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.530
 not too complicated I took a 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.680
 simple I mean for example if you 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.040
 take this one a good I think it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.870
 will go but for example that finally I think 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
 that images of too big qualities 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 I think it would be way too hard 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.120
 to do so so it's a fairy tale 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.900
 hutteau riels but before we finish 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.880
 I wanted to clarify that following the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
 presentation of fantasia ja would publish 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.079
 a little bit later because I had 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.069
 some problems with stasia cams like 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.040
 I explained also that finding 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.349
 chess 102 in two parts but no 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.690
 I have some problems so I 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.349
 would publish the space maybe from then 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.190
 yen finally this weekend I do not know where 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.370
