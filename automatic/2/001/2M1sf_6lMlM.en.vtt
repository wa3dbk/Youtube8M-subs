00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 very good people here is a new video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.340
 no trick to get very zombies 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 fast in call of duty advanced warfare 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 it's worth the first thing we have to do 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.410
 as you are seeing in the images of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.869
 background is going to be the main menu we're going to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.810
 go to cooperative exo survival 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.150
 ok we go into that menu and then 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 we entered a private party this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.619
 if I play with a friend it will be 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 much easier to get it with people 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 that you can talk can interact 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 so if you can have friends then 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 better nothing we enter a game 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 private and we go to game settings 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.719
 before starting the game the adjustments 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.100
 of the game and here on maps we will choose 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.079
 let's go good I'll explain a little bit 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.910
 how maps work and there as 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 four levels of maps this is the level 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.230
 1 then there will be 2 3 and the last one 4 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 when we have the fourth map already when 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.129
 we complete in fourth map we will have the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 zombie is worth to unlock the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.530
 level 2 we have to unlock 50 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 rounds in levels 1 and I will teach 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.390
 a very easy way to get it worth 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.100
 as you are watching in the background video 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.720
 well before that I have to get 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.570
 we have to use the weapon 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.180
 the heavy the heavy exo forgive the weapon 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.590
 expressed that the bullets are not over is 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.450
 infinite with what will help us 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.250
 quite and as you are seeing in the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.410
 video we're just going to go to a 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.260
 corner to a place where we are comfortable 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.880
 where there are no more than two doors or 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.180
 more than two alleys to get out 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.670
 enemies and our friend and you or your friend 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.230
 and you are going to cover it the two sites and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.910
 you see weapon killing killing killing 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.820
 killing thing like some campers we are going to 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.100
 say no and so rounds going round 2 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.600
 they are not cumulative with what 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.790
 they kill round 10 and we start again 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.210
 you have 10 rounds made with what is missing 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 40 is very good right one the first 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.160
 round or be the first level let's go 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.750
 the second is worth the second one we are going to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.910
 choose and this is important the map 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 because there is a click on the map of 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.310
 edition that helps us a lot that we 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.570
 we are going to go right away very well 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.150
 As you can see watching the video now of 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.440
 bottom there is a door there is a small 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.600
 clichÃ© there in the corner if we 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 we crouch we can pass and the enemies 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.620
 They will not kill us but we can 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.519
 kill him then 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.290
 not kill enemies accumulate 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.450
 enemies until passing round round 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.110
 round and it 's so there are 50 rounds 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.750
 but those 75 unlock level 3 once 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.450
 from level 3 we will choose the map of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.700
 solar is worth this is another small 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.340
 trick that there is in this map we choose 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.069
 the solar map and we enter in we initiate 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.590
 departure and once inside we're going to like 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.450
 you are looking through the background we are going to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.209
 go to a place that is there medium 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.489
 hidden are always those hiding places 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.349
 that where they can not attack us 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.660
 we hide there and we kill and we have to 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.579
 kill 100 rounds worth once killed 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.220
 you are doing rounds will unlock us 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.040
 in level 4 which is the last map there 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.730
 and then we have to make three rounds 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.579
 in this level 4 and 2 and it will unlock us 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.390
 the the zombie for the coal used 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.700
 warfare 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.319
 just show you these tricks for 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.150
 that you go very fast these rounds 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.560
 so that he gets that zombie and I'm going to 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.909
 Enjoy quietly with your 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.290
 friends as you want from the notes but 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.480
 well you know how to get fast from 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.890
