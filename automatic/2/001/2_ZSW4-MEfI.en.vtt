 very very well in this that I bring to you 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.380
 this video with this application very very 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.099
 good for all those if they want 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.990

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.909
 especially this that is running 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.030
 which serves us well and is quite 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.860
 simple you do not need something special 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.170
 this application is pretty good is 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.680
 made by nike and the application is called 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.130
 nike running is very very good and therefore 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.720
 we started with this now we do start 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.340
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.500
 go to the app store and download this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.010
 application that is totally free it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.230
 they call like and blogs or more running is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.210
 very good does not weigh much and nothing else 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.340
 they have to download in addition with this 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.770
 application does not need someone else 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.320
 Adding another device 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.270
 to good use once 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.820
 you have downloaded it we are going to 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.440
 go here to open or sell between yemen 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.430
 they have it and we can see here the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.260
 Interface 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.350
 of the application says that you want to know 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.120
 my location we give ok 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.980
 Here he tells you that if you want to know 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.690
 better the application of your future what 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.850
 you can start automatically we're going to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.620
 give you a tour to give us an idea and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.570
 us the details that we can 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.120
 share it on facebook we start to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.300
 run in any way also that 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.800
 we can use the night world this is a 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.510
 band but it is not necessary to use 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.920
 this device there is even another 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.070
 most dedicated application for this band 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.890
 but they give it to you as a detail besides 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.390
 it says with different things that it is that you 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.240
 take the time that says that route 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.850
 that in which places you have run more than 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.890
 us in different things here 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 we can see that on the internet we can see 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.009
 the distances the tours that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.979
 we do a thing every day that is very 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.840
 very good and I liked it a lot and 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.480
 Well that's all this gives us here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.850
 tutorial let's start it 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 in this first part we can start 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.200
 session with facebook or create an account 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.000
 on live.com 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.189
 If we already have an account, we can 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.530
 start here automatically but so 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.679
 simpler is to start it here with 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.739
 facebook let's start it we are nothing 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.440
 the facebook application and we wait for 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.819
 to finish loading this account as 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.849
 I tell you this application is very very 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.440
 good and it's totally free and the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.120
 we can take to run for 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.769
 measure our times and distances 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.470
 Here he tells us that they want to see us 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.629
 notifications we give ok how can we 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.849
 know here here the tour appears 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.519
 of my last race in last race 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.860
 travel 1.29 kilometers as something is 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.170
 something here tells you the number of races 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.049
 what have you done besides the speed 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.840
 average the one you've handled and here you 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.480
 it says that it advances so much even though you have more 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.329
 having done this race as we can 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.440
 see here this is the main interface 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.930
 obviously you in the first open 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.360
 it will not look like this but here 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.980
 we can give him something in him in that 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.440
 I can say button to start running 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.000
 and here we have other options like 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.950
 which are the home screen on which 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.299
 we are right here they give us our 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.550
 peÃ±a name in our account 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.700
 Facebook 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.830
 we are going here in activity to show you 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.780
 how can we see here tells us our 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.850
 last activity gives us enough data 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.490
 How can climate be the time that 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.870
 we went through countless things and the date 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.980
 in which this tour was made 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.660
 depending on how many races you have 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.130
 The list will look like this here 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.860
 I have nothing else used once and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.970
 as we can see in this application 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.400
 We can also link with our 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.500
 friends this is pretty good especially 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.270
 for when you run with friends or others 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.640
 friends you end up in exercise can see 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.280
 and look for what careers they have done 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.680
 countless things here we can see the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.360
 challenges these challenges are putting each 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 time the application depending how much 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.140
 I have traveled in that time 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.969
 in this part you can do the tour 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.519
 in less time in the same distance or 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.900
 even travel more distance everything 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.640
 move is totally here and here we can 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.549
 start a new challenge that you too what 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.239
 you can go creating below this we 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.769
 appear the configurations that we 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.079
 is sharing on facebook your 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.349
 races certain things that you do not have 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.420
 it does not have much simple and much useful 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.129
 see them but they are important as is 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.409
 what I told them to do more social 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.209
 share our stuff orientation 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.639
 of the screen the voice and that's from 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.229
 shoulder of the pensions with which you're going to 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.710
 Start your career to be motivated 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.080
 more among other things that we have here 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.389
 Here we have the ones to add other 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.550
 shoes or want another application and 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.740
 finally we see the store menu 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.449
 here we go to different products 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.789
 who drive there and obviously have to 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.150
 be you promote your brand and then here 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.550
 we can make purchases and good 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.100
 makes the home screen and we're going to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.980
 give it here in rom 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.110
 Now you can run and it 's ready as 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.630
 we can see here says that as it is a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.820
 ipod touch work with the gps in a 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.650
 iphone on an iphone are handled better 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.590
 this application but then I have a 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.020
 ipod touch so the mass of ok here 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.670
 let's give it continue and here it says 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.140
 where are you running too? 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.660
 You can run in a band and it goes 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.030
 managing the time you can choose the 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.590
 music here fits your list of 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.030
 reproduction is that you have and can 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.130
 choose the different songs that 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.450
 they want them to be that they will be 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.460
 reproducing here we have the 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.010
 orientation and finally to share 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.860
 our last things here we can see 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.210
 the options that I told them earlier 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.550
 and we're going to let them start running 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.190
 we have to wait for us to load the 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.200
 gps if we want the maps option but 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.270
 we can give it to continue and there is nothing 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.440
 will give us the distance but the rest 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.630
 do not 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.110
 as we can see here at the beginning of 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.030
 the race 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.920
 and we start talking here we can 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.540
 block this so that we are not 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.550
 Pica do not know in the voice at the time 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.590
 to run 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.450
 and we can also leave it like this so that 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.160
 continue to be maintained as we can see 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.920
 here here tells us the distance that 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.130
 We take the kilometers traveled and 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.870
 here comes the brand or the distance 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.600
 to the most well-known the speed with the 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.750
 that we manage our speed to 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.810
 finishing the race is only what 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.580
 we unlocked and ready as you can see 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.780
