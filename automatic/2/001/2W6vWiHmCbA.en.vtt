00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 if you are a bit up to date then 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 You may know that many companies 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 see the future in wearable computing and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 That is electronics that you put on your body 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 wear 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 So Samsung is one of the first ones there 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.950
 pontifically op in is played because on 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
 these houses announced the galaxy gear 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 and that is a smartwatch so a watch 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 with advanced functions 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 we spent the necessary time with this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.420
 watch to see if it's a useful one 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.649
 addition is useless for all 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.649
 his very expensive game me 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.030
 samsung is a presentation 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.570
 that it is really a gadget of the future 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.130
 is 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.130
 technology of the next decade 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.290
 they even said if you go to design 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.870
 looks it is actually quite retro 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.020
 it's a classic watch and it is 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.670
 yes a nice watch to see but you 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.010
 must keep in mind that if 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.740
 you want to wear it that is for a box 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.330
 large and it is also quite heavy for you 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.890
 it may be good on your wrist and it is not 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.020
 so that you are right that your arm is down 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 falls that you get cramping but it is 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.440
 no light watch to wear and that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.729
 is certainly a factor 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.160
 if you want to sit this as a kit 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.200
 use the screen what samsung has 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.570
 used that is a super amoled screen 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.820
 so that is the same technology as that 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.729
 is also putting in expensive smartphone and it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.590
 is a screen of 1.63 once one if you 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.630
 about me know how big it is as 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.330
 you can still remember the Nokia 3310 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.360
 yes about the size of the screen 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.520
 a resolution of 320 by 320 pixels 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.190
 that makes the pixel density approximately 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.540
 year 102 is 180 pixels per inch and that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.250
 is pretty neat the screen is too 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.619
 sharp it is beautiful to see 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.789
 the color splashes really occasionally 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.950
 fortunately, samsung also benefits 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.170
 thought that this screen was easy to read 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 must be like're outdoors and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.640
 also found an outdoor motor and 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.560
 outside mode which makes the screen extra 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.060
 skin that is nice because it is 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.830
 it probably also like in the sun 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.080
 good to see 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.240
 the galaxy times may according to samsung then 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.069
 technology from the future are the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.090
 processor is really one from a far 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.310
 past 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
 it is one from 2009, probably one 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.240
 exynos 3 that included in the metro once 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.010
 Galaxy Spica was sitting then 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.920
 and for yes for smartphone understanding that is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.959
 really a fred flintstone processor for that 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 the rest the galaxy gear is actually via 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.490
 a small smartphone it is in itself 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.780
 it even has a two microphone around 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.709
 the ambient noise 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.660
 filtering 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.550
 it has the speaker it has a pair 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.010
 sensors 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.690
 it has the bluetooth in short it can 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.490
 connect with anything yet what 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.350
 is not a telephone in itself you can not 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.490
 Calling independently should really be the 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.870
 have a telephone nearby 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.700
 but it does have a lot 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.700
 elements that your smartphone also has 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.460
 but the big question is of course what 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.890
 you can do exactly with the galaxy gear and it 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.270
 answer is actually quite what you 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.520
 can call with it and then 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.110
 you have to hold it to your ear that is in 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.820
 start a bit ridiculous and also the second 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.470
 and the third time without a task is best 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.250
 feel ridiculous but it works 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.690
 well 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.730
 you can also receive notifications 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.170
 coming in on the phone 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.270
 you can play all kinds of apps 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.860
 for example fitness apps that you use 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.270
 can track steps or other things 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.000
 when you start running 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.890
 can keep track of that is that is well done 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.060
 that is why you can work out well 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.400
 quite something with the thing but maybe 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.500
 the best feature is the camera that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 in it that we stop you putting it on 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.810
 have forward 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.300
 and the moment you start from the homescreen 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.459
 swipe down you immediately start that camera 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.500
 so you can take a picture very quickly 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.600
 much faster than when the phone is off 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.760
 Your bag should have the camera on it 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.050
 start up and have to take another photo 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.260
 it's a shame the camera does have one 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.870
 little loras is as many as 1313 100 pixels 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.940
 and that this yes about the front camera 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.310
 from a catch ordinary phone say 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.510
 but that the function is there yes that is real 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.310
 very well thought out 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.720
 in short with those features yes it is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.610
 actually pretty good I think so 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.500
 everyone can find something that one 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.150
 like in the galaxy gear 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.950
 where something is possible, it is daily 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.590
 but then there is another big one 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.080
 stumbling block wanted to be this success and 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.150
 that is the price is the suggested retail price and keep it 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.570
 you stuck 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.850
 299 euros I repeat again 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.950
 299 euros yes that is for an accessory 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.630
 with a telephone that belongs to itself 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.040
 maybe six or seven hundred euros or 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.860
 if you are even cheaper than for example 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.930
 galaxy s3 is 350 euros 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.930
 so way too much and way too much money 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.039
 in the time we have spent 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.319
 we can already do one with the galaxy times 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:16.330
 draw some conclusions firstly 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.650
 Lord is so terribly expensive that 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.190
 Samsung actually a big part of it 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.289
 his audience 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.360
 yes offside they can't do it 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.460
 pay or the habit for it 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.409
 and that makes the galaxy times in this 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.819
 Always shape as real nice product 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.889
 stay 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.569
 second with it has nice functions 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.159
 It really is not just the sport watch 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.470
 as many had previously thought 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.599
 but that really has a lot of variety 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.580
 functions but the real killer feature 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.469
 that is really missing for me 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.389
 bike that you say is worth it 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.940
 to put such a thing around your arm every day 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.500
 wear that is worth every day such 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.310
 charge to charge it 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.440
 to think 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.430
 the killer feature that I simply still have 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.840
 not 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.520
 and third, of course, there is the question 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.389
 is where ball computing ' 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.550
 really a new trend 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.110
 consumer electronics and what me 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.789
 Concerning is that yes it is there 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.710
 really you it has real potential 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.219
 but it is still largely unexplored 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.289
 so this area and this galaxy is really turning in 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.029
 one point zero product it is not finished it 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.370
 lacks a killer feature and the 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.349
 still knew everything wrong but it is 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300
 well in it and it is good that samsung 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.349
 this very young industry or was the 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.349
 keeps a finger on the pulse
