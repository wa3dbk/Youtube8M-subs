00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:25.529
 good evening today in our country the 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.989
 protagonists have been some clouds that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.810
 to detect them we need two 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.220
 satellite images of channelized 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 red and those of visible channel are the 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.450
 clouds some of which you see more the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 difference between the two channels is to your 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.220
 high time and especially when they are very 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.690
 thin with these channel images 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.160
 infrared can see those cloud masses 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.960
 that veil of high clouds that appears 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 over all the west of the country they look 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 clouds very blurred clouds very very 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 Delgaditas have little thickness on the other 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 side of the Balearic archipelago 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
 we see practically nothing without your key 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.560
 but we see little if we change 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 channel at the same time what we can see 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.640
 is that in all of the country almost 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.140
 disappear those clouds would be as if 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.340
 we had on top of the meteosat satellite 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 us looking with the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.990
 and we can not see them because they are very 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 thin almost transparent and instead 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 over the Balearic archipelago we see that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 the sky is free 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.789
 in this case we have very low clouds 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.679
 They are stuck to the ground and the channel 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.719
 infrared the other does not detect difference 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.759
 of temperature instead high clouds 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.259
 they are dug in red they look very white 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.740
 because they are very high and they are very 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.420
 cold 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 we have many pictures of those clouds 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 high come to us from different points 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.490
 of our country the first image that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.079
 we want to show you is from san 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.050
 lorenzo del escorial 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.980
 today those high clouds always 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.330
 contrails of the planes the middle layers 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.760
 atmospheric has been found or there 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.130
 relatively high humidity and delay 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.020
 airplanes those stelae are formed and those 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310
 stelae are marked remain mixed 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.470
 or rather that those clouds of type 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.530
 high your iron a photograph that we 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.300
 sent oscar hontoria another image of 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 high clouds is what comes to us from 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.250
 pontevedra from from illa de arousa 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.890
 A photograph sent to us I look at the size 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.360
 more images of very little high clouds 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 high clouds those are what we see here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.780
 we see it in the top part of those two 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 horizontal stripes also look 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.660
 airplane trails in this case we see how 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.490
 the sun is just above the garlic cape 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 a photograph in cantabria made by 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.020
 Mary not hernando and the last picture 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.870
 in this case the two stripes are those 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.010
 contrails contrails 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.540
 and in the right image of the screen 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.880
 they must also high clouds a photograph 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.490
 from the pool in salamanca made by 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.830
 virgilio sanchez this type of clouds the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.780
 we will see during the next hours 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.950
 underdeveloped but yes that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.770
 we will begin to notice some change to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.900
 starting on Sunday the clouds clouds more 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.900
 compact and even some preaching 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.660
 people high resolution satellite back 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.780
 Well, if you look at this image 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.850
 we expanded an area the north just above 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.600
 of the Basque country look at those lines 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.120
 they are steles of the planes that draw 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.800
 they are drawn in the middle of that tangle of 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.050
 clouds behind you have seen many points 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.030
 of the country has denied us photography by 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.070
 course from donostia 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 mikel vega always attentive with his camera 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.209
 water than the weather phenomenon 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.880
 also from logroño they point out those 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.110
 lovely precious airplane contrails 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.390
 airplane trails 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.300
 lovely airplane trails photography 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 sent by antonio and one more image in 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.190
 this case of pining 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.620
 image sent by eba ibáñez and today not 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.890
 we can resist the donation like these 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.440
 precious next this the precious ones 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.950
 contrails had two lovely stelae 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.950
 of airplaine
