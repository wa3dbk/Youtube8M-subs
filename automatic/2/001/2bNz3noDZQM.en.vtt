00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
is the Bulbasaur release I guess that's

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.660

the<00:00:53.390> first<00:00:53.420> release<00:00:54.219> so<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.339> features

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
the first release so it features

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
so you'll notice on the side is the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.680 
so you'll notice on the side is the
still<00:03:10.659> same<00:03:11.659> old<00:03:11.959> UI<00:03:12.769> which<00:03:13.159> will<00:03:13.549> soon<00:03:14.480> be

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
still same old UI which will soon be

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.789 
still same old UI which will soon be
replaced<00:03:14.930> excitedly

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
replaced excitedly

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.890 
replaced excitedly
but<00:03:16.610> there's<00:03:17.180> something<00:03:17.480> new<00:03:17.629> that<00:03:17.840> we<00:03:17.959> have

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
but there's something new that we have

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.199 
but there's something new that we have
so<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.500> parting<00:03:21.950> system<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.549> now<00:03:22.790> completely

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
so the parting system is now completely

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.220 
so the parting system is now completely
worked<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.359> spawn<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.930> members

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
worked in and you can spawn the members

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.289 
worked in and you can spawn the members
of<00:03:27.379> your<00:03:27.470> party<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.069> we<00:03:28.519> cannot<00:03:28.760> spawn<00:03:29.060> this

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
Charmander that is ours or release him

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.569 
Charmander that is ours or release him
from<00:03:32.660> his<00:03:32.859> pokeball<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.099> can<00:03:34.250> send<00:03:34.459> it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
from his pokeball and we can send it

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.930 
from his pokeball and we can send it
back<00:03:34.609> in<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.299> way<00:03:35.450> he<00:03:35.569> came<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.340> now<00:03:37.340> can<00:03:37.700> from

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
intuitively and I'll showcase later what

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.399 
intuitively and I'll showcase later what
that<00:03:49.159> means<00:03:49.400> cheese<00:03:49.790> fraps

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
that means cheese fraps

00:03:50.409 --> 00:04:08.660 
that means cheese fraps
alright<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:52.010> let's<00:03:52.340> catch<00:03:52.579> this<00:03:52.790> Pikachu

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.360 

so<00:04:09.209> now<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.780> another<00:04:09.989> feature<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:11.010> the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
so now this is another feature of the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.680 
so now this is another feature of the
party<00:04:11.640> system<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.860> have<00:04:14.010> all<00:04:14.370> any<00:04:15.620> like

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
party system you can have all any like

combination of your party out at once

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.150 
combination of your party out at once
including<00:04:20.900> false<00:04:21.900> or<00:04:22.109> Pikachu<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.860> can

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
including false or Pikachu so you can

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.430 
including false or Pikachu so you can
send<00:04:23.580> out<00:04:23.789> any<00:04:24.060> or<00:04:24.539> all<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.780> your<00:04:25.080> party

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
members at once and they'll still

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.659 
members at once and they'll still
intuitively<00:04:28.380> follow<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.250> now<00:04:29.340> what<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.520> mean

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
intuitively follow and now what I mean

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.150 
intuitively follow and now what I mean
by<00:04:29.729> intuitively<00:04:30.510> follow<00:04:30.930> means<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.830> they

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
by intuitively follow means that they

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.510 
by intuitively follow means that they
will<00:04:33.320> smartly<00:04:34.320> navigate<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.919> Train<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.370> right

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
will smartly navigate the Train so right

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.560 
will smartly navigate the Train so right
now<00:04:35.639> we<00:04:35.699> don't<00:04:35.910> have<00:04:37.850> collisions<00:04:38.850> on<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.150> but

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
now we don't have collisions on that but

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.930 
now we don't have collisions on that but
they'll<00:04:39.750> still<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.289> around<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.650> tree<00:04:40.889> or<00:04:41.100> say

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
they'll still go around the tree or say

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.129 
they'll still go around the tree or say
if<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.389> want<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.750> jump<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:43.350> giant<00:04:44.160> chasm<00:04:45.139> over

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
if I want to jump this giant chasm over

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.430 
if I want to jump this giant chasm over
here<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:48.330> easily<00:04:48.570> jump<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> because<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.320> have

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
here I can easily jump it because I have

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.680 
here I can easily jump it because I have
