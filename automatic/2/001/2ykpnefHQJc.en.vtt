00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the fun part of cooking this is the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
the fun part of cooking this is the
calisthenic<00:01:05.100> part<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.240> fresh

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
calisthenic part I'm using just fresh

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
calisthenic part I'm using just fresh
kosher<00:01:07.170> salt<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.770> use<00:01:07.950> whole<00:01:08.220> black<00:01:08.490> pepper

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
kosher salt and I use whole black pepper

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.399 
kosher salt and I use whole black pepper
I<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.330> white<00:01:09.540> pepper<00:01:09.780> white<00:01:10.380> pepper

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I do not use white pepper white pepper

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
I do not use white pepper white pepper
is<00:01:10.860> black<00:01:11.130> pepper<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> husk<00:01:12.030> removed<00:01:12.600> and
