"Cat Car (Wheelbarrow)"

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.210
Oh, it's a red light

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.980
Hm?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050
Gahhhh!?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.450
Ahhhh!? My Cat Car mk-2!!

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.680
This car right here!

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.110
came at me all of a sudden!

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.910
Man, I thought I was going to die!

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.750
Huh!?

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.010
Wait a minute, she's the one who came rushing all of a sudden and--

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.850
Ow ow ow ow ow!

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.310
I definitely broke my bones. This is totally a compound fracture

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.450
Full recovery's gonna take a hundred years

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.980
Sounds like trouble

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.980
It's better to stay out of it usa

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.410
You say you were hurt, but I don't see much external injury

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.650
Like I said, she came all of a sudden and--

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.210
Well!

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.680
That's because I always keep myself in shape!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.480
But I really thought I was going to die!

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.280
I forgot to say this earlier

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.150
My car have a drive recorder

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.050
Why don't we take a look at that first?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.880
Oh, here it is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.650
Ohh, well look at this...

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.710

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.550
Will you come with me to the police station?

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.810
Oh! Wait!

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.450
