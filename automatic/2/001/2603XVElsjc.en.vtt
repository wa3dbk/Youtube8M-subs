00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.009
 Can not really mean vacuuming the workshop's garage up and running 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.910
 Use rubble 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.299
 and then this does not move off 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.659
 maybe I'll try it with a cut filter from the hardware store 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:20.059
 the suction power is active, it has value once and then it was like that 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.919
 terrible if you have to spill the offender anyway sooner 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.349
 or later died 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.349
 and the prosecutor colder is over anyway 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 Now there is a solution 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.520
 The new harmful product is conditioned by a pressure pain trap 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.740
 and technology 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.010
 Without a filter trend, volume will be more than 99 percent of the total material 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.140
 The air circulates the material so it falls into the container 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 can be conveniently emptied as soon as the case 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.770
 Just connect the vacuum cleaner to the win and then you can 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 suck everything between heaven and water 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.730
 instead of and St 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.960
 they confess and rubble 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.880
 Kreibich and sanding dust 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.400
 you can even take care of 18 before it cools down when the suction hose 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.320
 can withstand up to 125 degrees Celsius and of course because no filter is there 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 the trend could be 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.290
 The best thing about the movement, however, is that you can fill the entire container 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.910
 can suck without the suction power decreases 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 which is for example by decree with the help of the case 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.470
 we have to do an experiment we have the airspeed if that 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.430
 Container is empty and receive a value of around seven meters per second 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.280
 then we saw the container full of, for example, very conversations 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.020
 as soon as the container is full 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 Weston renewed the airspeed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.840
 and see the team continue to buy 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.090
 That means 7 meters per second 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.350
 this appearance remains constant even though the container is full 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.070
 There are three different models of earthquake for industry and crafts 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.379
 Third Trapp controls up to 20 60 and 200 liter containers 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.700
 an institution of technology but also without the annoying Crete 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.079
 With our practical trolleys you can use the whirlwind and vacuum cleaner 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.489
 easy and convenient to take over larger areas 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.349
 Whirlwind has a kind of training camp of 99 percent 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.620
 that is 99 percent of what is said hero in the containers and only one 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 Percent ends up in the vacuum cleaner bag 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.269
 b 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.239
 an engineering team from Challandes University of Technology in Gothenburg 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.999
 which measured the downforce nutmeg even at 99 com a 9 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.069
 Shire has more than a shortage of days lost 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.700
 The whirlwind Ashton Kutcher is doing without filters unique due to it 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.379
 high efficiency and practical solutions 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.469
 more information about their financing unclear ddp Kalbach then come 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.239
 improved after seven starts 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.420
 with their everyday life 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.050
 easier
