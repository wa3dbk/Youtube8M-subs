00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
mile ride just just uh just to see if I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.770 
mile ride just just uh just to see if I
could<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.050> know<00:02:55.080> tolerate<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:55.950> bike<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
could you know tolerate this bike and I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.620 
could you know tolerate this bike and I
think<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:59.090> saddle<00:03:01.370> pain<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.269> get<00:03:03.450> used

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
think I can saddle pain but you get used

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.040 
think I can saddle pain but you get used
to<00:03:03.720> it

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
to it

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.860 
to it
no<00:03:04.290> I'll<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:04.890> used<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.370> time<00:03:05.720> today<00:03:06.720> I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
Sunday and so far like I said it's not

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.100 
Sunday and so far like I said it's not
that<00:03:36.570> bad

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
that bad

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.390 
that bad
not<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> bad<00:03:37.890> bike<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.850> very<00:03:39.329> very<00:03:40.140> light<00:03:40.769> for

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
not a bad bike it's very very light for

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.509 
not a bad bike it's very very light for
a<00:03:41.430> hybrid<00:03:41.970> I'm<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:43.470> gonna<00:03:43.650> lie<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:44.070> very

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
a hybrid I'm not gonna lie it's very

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.420 
a hybrid I'm not gonna lie it's very
late<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:44.820> average<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.829> guess<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.980> carving

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
late for average I guess the carving

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
late for average I guess the carving
fork<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:50.060> yeah<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.090> guess<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:51.989> would<00:03:52.110> be<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.410> I

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
fork and yeah I guess that would be it I

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.170 
fork and yeah I guess that would be it I
guess<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.980> carbon<00:03:53.340> fork<00:03:53.640> and<00:03:53.820> maybe<00:03:54.000> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
guess the carbon fork and maybe the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.930 
guess the carbon fork and maybe the
gearing<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:55.049> what<00:03:55.350> makes<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.769> lighter<00:03:56.040> I'm<00:03:56.549> not

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
gearing is what makes it lighter I'm not

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.060 
gearing is what makes it lighter I'm not
a<00:03:57.150> hundred<00:03:57.420> percent<00:03:57.570> sure<00:03:57.959> don't<00:03:58.410> vote<00:03:58.650> me<00:03:58.709> on

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
a hundred percent sure don't vote me on

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.729 
a hundred percent sure don't vote me on
it<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> think<00:04:00.030> that's<00:04:00.510> what<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.019> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it but I think that's what it is the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.920 
it but I think that's what it is the
spike<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.220> definitely<00:04:02.760> lighter<00:04:02.970> than<00:04:03.620> 7.3<00:04:04.850> FX

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
spike is definitely lighter than 7.3 FX

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.270 
spike is definitely lighter than 7.3 FX
but<00:04:07.820> like<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.970> said<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.180> love<00:04:09.450> it

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
but like I said I love it

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.210 
but like I said I love it
isil's<00:04:11.280> own<00:04:11.400> motto<00:04:11.670> stay<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.410> would<00:04:13.410> say<00:04:14.010> that's

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
isil's own motto stay I would say that's

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.259 
isil's own motto stay I would say that's
a<00:04:14.459> gimmick<00:04:15.620> can't<00:04:16.620> say<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.239> know

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
a gimmick can't say that it's you know

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.279 
a gimmick can't say that it's you know
it<00:04:18.600> really<00:04:19.130> takes<00:04:20.130> away<00:04:20.340> anything<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.810> feels

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
it really takes away anything it feels

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.210 
it really takes away anything it feels
like<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> gimmick<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.979> me<00:04:23.130> and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
like a gimmick to me and
