00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.839
 Research groups such as Keio University at Interaction 2011 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.160
 Shoulder riding avatar for distance communication 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.290
 Demonstration of "TEROOS" 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.610
 For example, video chat with people far away now 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.450
 It came to be done 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.750
 For example, going out together or shopping 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.860
 There is a problem that you can not do it 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.280
 A remote person wears an avatar here 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.050
 People who are far away due to things going out 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.890
 By operating this robot (avatar) and looking at various directions freely 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.400
 As if I were shopping or dating with him 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.000
 It is something you can experience 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.190
 This robot has a camera, a microphone and a speaker 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 You can move the head in 6 degrees of freedom 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.190
 The speakers are directional and allow for whisper-like communication at the ear 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 The camera works in the wearer's field of view 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.739
 It is possible to communicate as if you were always together 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.999
 Then, for example, "take that cup" 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.149
 When using such a pronoun 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.929
 The advantage is that you can communicate smoothly 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.719
 I can change the facial expression etc. of this avatar 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.549
 You can appeal to other people around you 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.679
 We made all the body original 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.679
 Print out what was generated by CAD with 3D printer by yourself 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:38.439
 Attach microcomputers and amplifiers using six commercially available servomotors 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.340
 Connected to the body 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.850
 Communication for operating the robot is the operation sent to the smartphone 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.440
 Information is sent to the microcomputer via Bluetooth 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.909
 The robot is supposed to move 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.029
 Also, communication between video and audio is done via Skype 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:01.270
 The person who is operating controls the top, bottom, left and right 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.800
 Manipulate the face by moving it freely 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.140
 Facial expression click eyes open and close icons 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.500
 Is easy to do by doing
