you think are the best but for number
one<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.300> definitely<00:00:30.720> started<00:00:30.900> off<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.349> the

one we definitely started off with the
blue<00:00:31.650> hurricane<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.550> believe<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
blue hurricane which I believe is the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
blue hurricane which I believe is the
best<00:00:33.780> hands-down<00:00:34.610> ultimate<00:00:35.610> attack<00:00:35.940> for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
best hands-down ultimate attack for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.990 
best hands-down ultimate attack for
melee<00:00:36.450> based<00:00:36.690> characters<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:38.129> damage<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
melee based characters the damage the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.040 
melee based characters the damage the
amount<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.480> strength

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
amount of strength

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.430

an<00:00:40.140> amount<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> power<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> does<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:43.320> an

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
an amount of power that it does to an

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.760 
an amount of power that it does to an
opponent<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.000> lot<00:00:45.390> especially<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> get

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
opponent is a lot especially if you get

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.770 
opponent is a lot especially if you get
them<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> entire<00:00:47.430> hurricane<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.390> only

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
them in the entire hurricane not only

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
them in the entire hurricane not only

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
thing and the downside of boat blue

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560 
thing and the downside of boat blue
hurricane<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.989> miss<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> aim<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
looking at so it's difficult a little

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.950 
looking at so it's difficult a little
bit<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.829> once<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> hit<00:00:59.340> him<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.760> over

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
bit but once you hit him it's over
