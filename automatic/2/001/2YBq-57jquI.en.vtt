00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.830
 Here is such a model to 1 3653 it is called 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.460
 In principle, this is amber but of course 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.949
 the real hangar has other covers 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.470
 simpler plastic is not so cool 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.199
 Classic reds and it has 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.570
 This type of fishing fish need it too 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 the most 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.769
 fishing knife that is in it let's 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 immediately gutted his tools like 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 always a lot of main blade applies 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.880
 he to the officer's knife length 91 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.670
 millimeter respectively 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.149
 he blade is the smallest blade ever 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.149
 superfluous does not happen 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 opener combined with a screwdriver but 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 all as always there is a thing 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 isolation supposedly cleaned on we go even 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.760
 one can opener combined with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 small screwdriver and then what 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.519
 makes it really fishing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.520
 knife this pliers combined with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.960
 not crimping tool pieces happy 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.369
 I do not know that there is a fishing mother 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.760
 sometimes it happens sometimes when 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 you make a leash on a pike yourself 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 comes in handy and here's such a delicious 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.770
 fish scaler 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 on it at the end of the extractor hooks in fish 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.110
 save retrieve but there is a scale metzitz 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.030
 fish centimeters and inches well, I do not know 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 such a small fish well, except your 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.990
 sticky appeared possible or so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.359
 shifting through the subway pike 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.299
 here but by itself then a corkscrew for 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.039
 gourmet one piece available 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.649
 of course awl 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.149
 Well , not a superfluous tweezers and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.969
 toothpick 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.119
 if the fish bones shot you 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.869
 in your teeth itâ€™s inadvertently a ring to 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.410
 to fasten 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.739
 I advise you to use this one 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.739
 chain with a lock on the fishing to not let 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.000
 god boy don't drown means here 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.519
 there is of course a reasonable question why 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.500
 pliers for fishing and need potatoes 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.560
 for example repair unleash 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 something there again squeeze the leash then 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 there is only necessary and cautiously 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.970
 multitool to such an elegant 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.450
 small fishing like nakhla so 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.420
 trawl is such a thing will be more than 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.910
 sufficient fish scaler would seem 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.299
 difficulty folding knife to fig just here 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.310
 how to use fish scaler 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.090
 all this gentle gut he will 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 sand and scales with a visit and sand 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.940
 very easy to use what we have 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.950
 at hand is the easiest version 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.370
 plastic bag on the package people 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.549
 is always 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:14.799
 and with you at least from the words of food 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:18.650
 we pierce the focus altos de focus 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.260
 So he found the trick and everything is perfect 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.209
 safe use a little here 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.769
 dirty it you can clean it yourself 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.750
 tweezers to take the wrong from the package usually 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.370
 You can use any rag 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.540
 just wrap it made sturdiness 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.209
 new perk passage pierce to wind 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.130
 all for 1 hand does not slip 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.160
 again, it is more convenient to honor and again dirt 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.630
 no tool the more party process 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.630
 brushing fish for doing i so them 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.340
 certain time such crap of course 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.980
 I will not feel the fish 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.830
 nevertheless has the right to 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.840
 existence because quizzes like 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.760
 bad things don't do well and third 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.680
 option forcibly really clean 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.720
 fish with this tool but 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.069
 wind it in foil after all 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.450
 totally all be so great 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.860
 brilliantly beautiful subject 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.449
 enemies can not ass can be wrapped 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.880
 that's all use to health all 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.750
 just like always this free 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.290
 spoiled knife and quiz player 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.600
 not up to games rather without a fish all for all bye 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.020
 laughter love up the following videos which 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.020
