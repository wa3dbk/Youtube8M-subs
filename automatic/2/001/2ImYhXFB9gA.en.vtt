when<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.340> making<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:02.970> video<00:00:03.330> about<00:00:03.740> Reid

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
when I'm making this video about Reid

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.039 
when I'm making this video about Reid
pressurizing<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.460> system<00:00:05.580> on<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> PHA<00:00:06.720> Titan

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
pressurizing the system on a PHA Titan

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.820 
pressurizing the system on a PHA Titan
or<00:00:07.350> back<00:00:08.280> seat<00:00:08.580> boiler<00:00:09.349> positon<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.470> just<00:00:10.679> one

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
or back seat boiler positon is just one

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.560 
or back seat boiler positon is just one
of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> brands<00:00:11.280> back<00:00:11.550> seesaw<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> expect<00:00:12.420> it's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
of the brands back seesaw I expect it's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.770 
of the brands back seesaw I expect it's
very<00:00:12.780> similar<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.559> back<00:00:13.889> seat<00:00:14.480> my<00:00:15.480> pressure

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
very similar on a back seat my pressure

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.870 
very similar on a back seat my pressure
had<00:00:15.990> fallen<00:00:16.259> below<00:00:16.560> naught<00:00:16.890> point<00:00:17.069> 5<00:00:17.310> bar<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.819> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
had fallen below naught point 5 bar so I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.470 
had fallen below naught point 5 bar so I
have<00:00:17.999> the<00:00:18.119> error<00:00:18.300> code<00:00:18.599> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.710> boiler<00:00:20.099> as<00:00:20.480> e1

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
have the error code on the boiler as e1

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.859 
have the error code on the boiler as e1
1:9<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> says<00:00:23.489> on<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.149> manual<00:00:24.689> that's

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
1:9 and as it says on the manual that's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.130 
1:9 and as it says on the manual that's
because<00:00:25.409> the<00:00:25.529> pressure<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.979> too<00:00:26.279> low<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
because the pressure is too low so I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
because the pressure is too low so I
looked<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.559> manual<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.069> looked

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
looked in the manual and looked

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.879 
looked in the manual and looked
underneath<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.239> the<00:00:31.199> pictures<00:00:31.649> in<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:31.889 
underneath and the pictures in the

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:33.740 
underneath and the pictures in the
manual<00:00:32.279> didn't<00:00:33.210> look<00:00:33.300> anything<00:00:33.570> like

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
manual didn't look anything like

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.400 
manual didn't look anything like
underneath<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> boiler<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.699> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.090> see

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
underneath the boiler as you can see

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.779 
underneath the boiler as you can see
there's<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.620> taps<00:00:37.949> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:38.550> hand<00:00:38.730> side

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
there's two taps on the right hand side

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.720 
there's two taps on the right hand side
underneath<00:00:39.269> and<00:00:40.010> neither<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.519> got

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
underneath and neither of them have got

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
underneath and neither of them have got
the<00:00:41.879> Spurs<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.460> or<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> filling<00:00:44.910> loop

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the Spurs or the or the filling loop

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
the Spurs or the or the filling loop
that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.839> need<00:00:46.019> to<00:00:46.230> re<00:00:46.379> pressurize<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that you need to re pressurize the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.579 
that you need to re pressurize the
system<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.809> thought<00:00:48.809> oh<00:00:48.839> god<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.440> haven't

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
system I thought oh god they haven't

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.340 
system I thought oh god they haven't
fitted<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.789> am<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.089> do<00:00:51.350> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
fitted it what am I going to do so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
fitted it what am I going to do so
looked<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.339> manual<00:00:53.999> nothing<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.499> then<00:00:55.859> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
looked in the manual nothing and then I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.329 
looked in the manual nothing and then I
recall<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.969> moved<00:00:57.179> in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> house

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
recall that when we moved in the house

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.130 
recall that when we moved in the house
and<00:00:59.339> been<00:00:59.519> told<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.089> to<00:01:00.480> repressurize<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and been told that to repressurize the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.670 
and been told that to repressurize the
system<00:01:02.210> there's<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.659> an<00:01:03.780> extra<00:01:04.320> tube

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
system there's actually an extra tube

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.090 
system there's actually an extra tube
coming<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:06.110> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.920> those<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:10.100> taps

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
coming in to the right of those two taps

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.330 
coming in to the right of those two taps
can<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.390> down<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> right<00:01:13.340> well

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
can you see it just down the right well

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
can you see it just down the right well
that's<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> direct<00:01:15.060> feed<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:15.930> cold

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's the direct feed from the cold

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
that's the direct feed from the cold
water<00:01:16.380> main<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> although<00:01:18.000> there's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
tap underneath the boiler if you look

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
tap underneath the boiler if you look
underneath<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.290> kitchen<00:01:22.469> sink<00:01:22.790> or<00:01:23.790> somewhere

somewhere else and to repressurize the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.279 
somewhere else and to repressurize the
system<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.119> turn<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.539> tap<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:40.020> and

to clockwise at the same time you watch
the<00:01:43.409> pressure<00:01:43.649> gauge<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.659> your<00:01:45.659> system

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the pressure gauge and your system

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.139 
the pressure gauge and your system
pressure<00:01:46.409> should<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.430> between<00:01:48.619> one<00:01:49.619> and

pressure should go up to between one and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.800 
pressure should go up to between one and
one<00:01:51.149> point<00:01:51.869> five<00:01:52.289> bars<00:01:52.859> and<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.780> simple

one point five bars and it's as simple
as<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.649> need<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
as that so no need to go out and get a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.029 
as that so no need to go out and get a
refilling<00:01:58.590> loop<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> just<00:02:00.799> have<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> look

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
refilling loop and just have a look

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.469 
refilling loop and just have a look
under<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> sink<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.149> you've<00:02:03.299> got

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
under the sink and see if you've got

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.140 
under the sink and see if you've got
something<00:02:03.689> similar
