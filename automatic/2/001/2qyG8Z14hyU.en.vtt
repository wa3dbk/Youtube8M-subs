00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.839
 yes, as they see in the title, 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will teach to be the bitch of rabona 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.450
 is this and I do not know in other countries but not 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.890
 I know if they will call it another way but in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.830
 my country is called the 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.230
 the bicycle and that's what they saw there 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.930
 good to do it 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.320
 the rabona feint simply have 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.930
 to do this the running because they have to 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.500
 find good speed and do l2 and 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.260
 quickly box and x the of 2 and the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.960
 I think of the chute that is 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 quickly box and X or circle and 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 X and Y 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 there they are seeing it again and they have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.110
 to find good speed 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.350
 l 2 pictures and quickly 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.700
 good and now I will teach you how to do 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.060
 the the good bicycle to do the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.720
 bicycle for me is much more much more 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.960
 easy there are watching there are there and they do 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.620
 down up there, I make it slow 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 but they have to do fast not like that 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.820
 so that you do not see yourself or anything 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.300
 so if you have to do it well 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.750
 fast with the arrow with the analog era 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.119
 right which is then with which it is done 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.610
 in the feeds there are seeing another 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.500
 another type of bicycle and medium action 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.170
 but there it is like a medium 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.170
 heel is very easy to do too is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.649
 the same as doing the bicycle only that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.210
 the first time you throw the analog for 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.440
 ahead 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.810
 you leave it a second longer as a small 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.740
 more time than the normal bicycle 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.680
 the first time he throws it up 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.869
 a little more time the first time 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.930
 he throws it up and the second what 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.209
 It's normal and that's how you'll be treated like 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:11.140
 with with a heel and then there they are 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.620
 watching some chutes that are like that of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 as well as teaching them to 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.739
 Then, with the ball, it took effect but 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.440
 That is not the one I will not teach them in 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.050
 this video but if I see that they 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.110
 like at least we have two or three likes 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.110
 well, I will teach you how to make the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.900
 lame ball has been in effect and therefore 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.209
 can make their fantastic goals and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.989
 Well, this has been all for the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.780
 today's video 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:49.500
 Give me a like sign, I know if it should improve 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.500
 leave it in the comments and goodbye
