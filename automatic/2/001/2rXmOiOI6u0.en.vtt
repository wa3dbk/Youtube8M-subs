00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 on google stove and on commenting and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.870
 today we finally begin with the war of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.160
 ezio models and others already this series the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 that I will go comparing models of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.469
 slander warfare and good had thought 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.089
 two comparisons the first would be the r 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.529
 x the punch the counter steel bites and the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.539
 second would be the melissa and against the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 mini super ten in this case I have seen more 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.080
 It's opportune to do the one on the art that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.460
 as the top of best functions says 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 high and some have doubts about whether 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260
 it really was better the ancce cup that 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 the silva and thus well desmiento all 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.500
 those who have that little doubt do not 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.120
 so then I hope you like the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 format is very similar to what I did with 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 the multiple comparison of jumps 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.510
 I'm just going to put a gun here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 each side of the screen while 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 I leave a pair of clip with each gun to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 that you see how they work then good 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 you are already seeing the two on the screen 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.180
 models that we have on the left 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 commanded the part of the ricky right 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.260
 jungle the first one is team the patch 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 what I'm seeing in the gameplay goes up 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.710
 two points of damage you get one of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.260
 precision and you lower one of handling and the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 region still bite win three points 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.910
 damage loses two precision and loses 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 a decadence then good both 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.610
 Sacred weapons are easy to compare 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.140
 we 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 same weapon are simply different 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.160
 models with which then you have to go 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.770
 statistical statistics to see in what 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.350
 highlights one over another not so good 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
 that's similar weapons for making us a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 kind of advice on how to play with 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.690
 them I really when they touch 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 function to the touch 6 that according to my opinion 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.530
 Well I told you that I better go better 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.380
 line site and the option is in the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.210
 hell that the rx because the rx requires 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.620
 a skill higher than me 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.140
 they want automatic arms weapons of 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.690
 bursts are weapons a little more 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 difficult to use then well then yes 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.170
 I think they are very good but not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.150
 is within reach of any power 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 play with ease with these weapons I 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.350
 really quite caught the trick 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000
 but I have not reached the maximum level that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.770
 you can reach with aim with a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.840
 rafa weapon not the others skid 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.170
 they need a lot to know how to put you in the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 good marksmanship map and I do not know also the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.810
 face to face you have to move a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.550
 special way to earn them with long 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.600
 of rafa so you have to be careful to 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.190
 when playing with the type of weapons 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.560
 but they really are very good 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.119
 so I always recommend combat 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.250
 bursts unsheathed and that stock 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.110
 always and then if you like the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.459
 peephole of the rx that in the next one that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.150
 is how to get to this country in my line 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 of points 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.420
 can you put it on miguel 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.650
 point every extended hour you can put 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.970
 even am in muffler that does not 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.860
 it affects or practically nothing this weapon 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 consciousness is doing very well so good 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.189
 let's move on now if you seem to look at 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.840
 who read gago with kings up close 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.790
 witnesses and the got look good 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.200
 even up close is a beast not though 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.750
 is here then that in long distance 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.519
 above all but good let's go there with 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.200
 the with the real statistics of each 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.150
 weapon and the mega transition of milk and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.709
 well improve those new templates and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.959
 well, the charger of the two is the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.000
 same 30 bullets normal 41 expanded the 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.659
 Recharge time in both is the same 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.069
 1.3 normal 1 with the fast and 1 with 3 a 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.170
 little bit more maybe with the empty one since 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
 have that little bolt good forgive 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.519
 that little bullet from the bedroom and then 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.700
 has the difference not when losing 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.889
 precision of the rx steel by it has 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.579
 a little goes a little better is 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.109
 a little more 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.879
 Of course you have a little more 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.920
 high is medium it takes a little bit up 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.019
 left distant ideas the network and sylvain 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.609
 suffers a little bit if we shoot too much 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.379
 fast so in that aspect but that 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.730
 you win the hope and cher then we have 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.379
 the cadence another aspect by which 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.389
 also loses to sting by we already have in 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.099
 screen percent the shaft by the bad 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.660
 what it has is that it loses cadence 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.820
 You lose too much but when d 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.380
 face to face it is quite noticeable then 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.640
 good is a weapon that as it is having 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.080
 the clips because it also distributes the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.320
 nearby groceries and has enough 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.730
 like a skill pull but let me 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.710
 always if it will start from that I could get 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.450
 more cadence then it is better to throw more 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.340
 bullets because we're going to kill faster not 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.840
 it's obvious so in this case we have 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.850
 a burst left the panzer with a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.280
 cadence of 800 and another burst the shaft 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.660
 bay has a cadence of 750 and good 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.980
 because the lack of if we were 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.690
 shooting counting mumble 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 bursts because then those weapons of 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.100
 bursts the heat and the delay that stops 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.810
 by and for the next burst has a 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.950
 small delay is worth not leave for the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.960
 weapon as if it were automatic 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.400
 practically as it happens with the m8 but 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.750
 that in this case, you have a term 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.550
 built-in delay that can make 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.530
 lose some marksmanship is not going to 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.390
 shoot a target then in this case 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.030
 then the rx and we shoot without stopping you have 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.710
 and certain 10 bullets per minute and steel 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.000
 bait 507 bullets per minute a little bit 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.550
 except not so because of this aspect 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.310
 also wins the rx steel bike and good 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.020
 I remember for those who 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.150
 you say I'm a liar whatever 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.239
 these others because of the PC game of 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.380
 source code of the game I have removed 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.060
 doing a lot of research and that's how they are all 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.530
 real and I do not invent anything friend if a 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.480
 it does not benefit me at all to say that a 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.250
 weapon is better than another because it is not 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.590
 I expected that maikel with you something pays me 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.480
 why is not it so I tell you what 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.590
 it really is better for you and according to 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.690
 my good gaming experience in this 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.550
 Well you see then what data to data ' 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.169
 because the last two that we have left 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.790
 they are practically today 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.280
 practically not exactly the same 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.110
 up to 50 meters of three bullets ie 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.490
 of a blast and from then on 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.740
 there were four bullets in a crack and a 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.120
 It 's weird that we raise the blast 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.530
 people are a little far away so 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.850
 well we usually have to give two 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.560
 bursts to kill people which 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.570
 It's very good because the gusts come out 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.610
 this fast and here comes the statistics 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.310
 key of the models not the damage though 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.990
 it seems that according to statistics put 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.150
 the steel goes and increases three damage 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.910
 I can assure you 100% that the year that 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.010
 have two in it be 35 35 over 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.110
 100 and then 25 then good thing 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.460
 weapons kill exactly the same so 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.900
 now doing this kind of 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.310
 colorines to see what each one stands out 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.190
 one then we have tied in charger 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.170
 Recharge reach and damage but between 12 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.670
 and cadence will win the king excuse being and 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.380
 that's why I always say it's better 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.120
 the Xs blame be because why 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.340
 lose precision and cadence if that point 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.830
 of the year does not affect anything like that 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.630
 that this is the comparison kids and 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.890
 good one last indication for those who 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.950
 do not know how the scope has worked and 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.050
 damage the first damage of 35 applies 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.150
 up to 7 with 6 meters to between 7 and 6 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.670
 meters and 50 with another meter applies to 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.320
 of 35 the second and from 50 with 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.460
 another meter applies the 25's so 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.020
 all weapons vouchers for tennis players 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.940
 so in this case we have to 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.370
 declare clear winner to the rx or the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.160
 panzer for good because he does not lose 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.990
 cadence and precision and well they are 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.980
 has the same scope damage not the one 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.990
 I hope this comparison is fair 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.180
 kids of the law have liked the 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.010
 video for more comparisons ainda do 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.200
 one every week so he liked not 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.940
 forget to leave a I like favorites and 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.940
 goodbye weeks scooby
