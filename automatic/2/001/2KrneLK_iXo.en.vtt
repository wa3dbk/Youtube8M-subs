00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.850
 Hello dear ever piece I'm counting to the Tec pros and in this video 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.399
 is again your cooperation asked and that is about the defective batteries 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.819
 to be exact it is about the batteries the standard MacBook or MacBook Pro installed 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.030
 are 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630
 I have the fullest with the question of how the state should 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.670
 if I tell you a bit about the history of the battery 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 which is installed in these Mac Books or MacBook Pros 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.880
 Last year he had a great change and that has happened 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.370
 Apple determined 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.989
 Away from the battery which the user himself can take us to the APO 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.320
 Gene Munster and no longer able to expand itself so the permanently installed 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.540
 suspicion 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.670
 Apple has opted for this step 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.620
 because 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 this can increase the battery performance 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.350
 You have to imagine a park and you can expand yourself, you need 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 still 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.840
 special mechanisms that are easy for the user 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.909
 yes, there are not any more records yet rugged it does 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.920
 This is not easy, so it is of course still 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.390
 easy 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.080
 it would have gone that step 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.160
 and now has more space 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.470
 to use 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 and more space for the battery yesterday size simply and thereby keeps the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.790
 Countries in two different ways 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.930
 get longer once 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.390
 that means he has 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.610
 Dr there are more charging cycles man creates more charge cycles from the course 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.530
 rest on Apple Dieter breaks 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.340
 which is supposed to be three times as many cycles as a normal one 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 Notebook Baku out 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.290
 probably contribute 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.970
 After these thousand cycles, Apple says you have to learn to buy a new battery 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.200
 the other thing is that it is bigger than the other bigger one 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.890
 Capacity and you can work with it longer Apple gives it 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.119
 seven hours on moderate internet surfing and 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.769
 Anna r medium brightness 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.359
 those are the benefits now but to actual video question to you what 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.949
 for a battery, the built-in Mac Book also has the old or snow 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.349
 new permanently installed 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.439
 how many charging cycles does it have and how does it look with your battery? 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.269
 from and we the house with you at the side short and although there is the sport at home 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.890
 Picture will if you know otherwise a Reiner Lenz certainly already fights that 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.150
 is very helpful as the nano one can not only check the battery here 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.889
 but also a lot of other things for example C major utilization which 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.890
 Processes are in progress and how much CPU will continue to eat us 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.259
 but much more important for us now is here 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:57.409
 SID battery 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.359
 and mine counts here 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.909
 I have 18 60 Dozic already loaded behind me 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.220
 and my AKU health so my battery keeps up with Red 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.439
 3 90 percent 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.669
 how is it with you that my question will sell you 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:15.609
 and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.629
 I am now from intec professionals I wish you still unsightly western 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.659
 Sunday and I'm out 2 actually going on 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:30.530
 Tomorrow we have s
