00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
as well it is very mad so if you don't

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.510 
as well it is very mad so if you don't
like<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> matte<00:03:43.200> finish<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.220> might<00:03:44.340> not<00:03:44.370> be

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
like a matte finish and it might not be

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
like a matte finish and it might not be
for<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.000> they<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.600> have<00:03:45.900> their<00:03:45.930> new<00:03:46.230> ones

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
for you but they do have their new ones

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.860 
for you but they do have their new ones
that<00:03:46.590> come<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:46.980> glossy<00:03:47.370> shiny<00:03:48.300> aversion

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.990 
won it probably quite a lot in the
summer<00:04:22.680> last<00:04:23.010> year<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.729> I've<00:04:23.820> started

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
summer last year but I've started

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.990 
summer last year but I've started
getting<00:04:24.510> out<00:04:24.660> again

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
getting out again

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.610 
getting out again
because<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.300> such<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:25.480> nice<00:04:25.750> bright<00:04:26.230> pink

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
because it's such a nice bright pink

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.080 
because it's such a nice bright pink
whenever<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.280> wear<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.700> get<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:27.940> lot<00:04:28.030> of

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
whenever I wear this I get a lot of

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.910 
whenever I wear this I get a lot of
compliments<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.930> think<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.500> kinda<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.740> in

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
compliments I think it's kinda like in

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.620 
compliments I think it's kinda like in
between<00:04:30.040> a<00:04:30.220> coral<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.970> pink<00:04:31.240> so<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:31.600> a

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
between a coral and a pink so it's a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.630 
between a coral and a pink so it's a
really<00:04:31.870> nice<00:04:32.080> pretty<00:04:32.440> thing<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.460> think

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
really nice pretty thing and I think

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.220 
really nice pretty thing and I think
this<00:04:33.910> would<00:04:34.090> look<00:04:34.120> really<00:04:34.510> really<00:04:34.870> good<00:04:34.960> with

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
this would look really really good with

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.500 
this would look really really good with
the<00:04:35.320> tan<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:36.070> i'm<00:04:36.280> hoping<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.730> i'll<00:04:36.970> probably

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
the tan so i'm hoping that i'll probably

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.120 
the tan so i'm hoping that i'll probably
be<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.720> holiday<00:04:38.200> because<00:04:38.590> i<00:04:38.770> think<00:04:38.830> it'll<00:04:39.070> be

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
be a holiday because i think it'll be

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.470 
be a holiday because i think it'll be
really<00:04:39.190> really<00:04:39.550> nice<00:04:39.760> one<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.180> work<00:04:40.300> like

girls but I got into it really quickly I
read<00:06:46.740> it<00:06:46.830> really<00:06:47.010> quickly<00:06:47.250> and<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.760> really<00:06:48.060> got

into it and I've got into the characters
and<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:50.040> story<00:06:50.100> and<00:06:51.060> yeah<00:06:51.450> I<00:06:51.480> read<00:06:51.750> it<00:06:51.870> very

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.630 
and the story and yeah I read it very
quickly<00:06:52.380> i<00:06:52.560> think<00:06:52.830> it<00:06:52.890> was<00:06:52.950> like<00:06:53.070> two<00:06:53.250> days<00:06:53.430> or

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
quickly i think it was like two days or

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.280 
quickly i think it was like two days or
something<00:06:53.850> but<00:06:54.630> they<00:06:54.780> actually<00:06:54.960> bring<00:06:55.230> a

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
something but they actually bring a

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.720 
something but they actually bring a
sequel<00:06:55.710> apt<00:06:55.800> this<00:06:56.100> which<00:06:56.280> is<00:06:56.430> super<00:06:56.580> exciting

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
sequel apt this which is super exciting

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.450 
sequel apt this which is super exciting
and<00:06:57.390> i<00:06:57.840> will<00:06:58.080> probably<00:06:58.560> buy<00:06:58.770> that<00:06:58.980> before<00:06:59.310> i<00:06:59.340> go

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.180 
story of us by Danny Atkins and she was
the<00:07:15.390> lady<00:07:15.540> that<00:07:15.840> wrote<00:07:16.080> fractured<00:07:16.830> which<00:07:16.860> I

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
the lady that wrote fractured which I

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.470 
the lady that wrote fractured which I
think<00:07:17.370> a<00:07:17.430> lot<00:07:17.460> of<00:07:17.610> people<00:07:17.700> have<00:07:18.090> read<00:07:18.270> as<00:07:18.450> well

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
think a lot of people have read as well

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.430 
think a lot of people have read as well
and<00:07:19.190> yeah<00:07:20.190> this<00:07:20.430> was<00:07:20.670> really<00:07:21.000> good<00:07:21.450> again<00:07:22.230> it

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
and yeah this was really good again it

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.450 
and yeah this was really good again it
was<00:07:22.530> kind<00:07:22.740> of<00:07:22.770> something<00:07:22.920> that<00:07:23.070> I<00:07:23.190> couldn't

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
was kind of something that I couldn't

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.070 
was kind of something that I couldn't
put<00:07:23.580> down<00:07:23.820> and<00:07:24.210> I<00:07:24.510> really<00:07:24.690> wanted<00:07:24.870> to<00:07:24.930> get<00:07:25.020> to

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
put down and I really wanted to get to

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.720 
put down and I really wanted to get to
the<00:07:25.230> end<00:07:25.380> of<00:07:25.590> because<00:07:26.010> while<00:07:26.400> I<00:07:26.430> was<00:07:26.580> reading

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
the end of because while I was reading

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.370 
the end of because while I was reading
out<00:07:26.910> I<00:07:26.940> just<00:07:27.090> couldn't<00:07:27.210> do<00:07:27.330> anything<00:07:27.540> else<00:07:27.780> so

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 
out I just couldn't do anything else so

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.660 
out I just couldn't do anything else so
I<00:07:28.440> thought<00:07:28.590> if<00:07:28.710> I<00:07:28.770> just<00:07:28.920> read<00:07:29.160> it<00:07:29.340> then<00:07:29.580> I

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
I thought if I just read it then I

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.490 
I thought if I just read it then I
actually<00:07:29.790> get<00:07:30.030> my<00:07:30.240> other<00:07:30.330> jobs<00:07:30.660> done<00:07:30.930> you<00:07:31.320> like

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
actually get my other jobs done you like

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.230 
actually get my other jobs done you like
a<00:07:31.530> good<00:07:31.800> old<00:07:31.920> Galu<00:07:32.250> book<00:07:32.460> then<00:07:32.790> I<00:07:32.820> think<00:07:33.120> you'll

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.880

really<00:07:33.420> like<00:07:33.540> this<00:07:33.900> yeah<00:07:34.230> and<00:07:34.380> now<00:07:34.530> I<00:07:34.560> think

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890 
really like this yeah and now I think

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.230
