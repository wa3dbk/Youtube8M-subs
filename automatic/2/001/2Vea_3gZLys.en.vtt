00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
you think he's supposed to show depth on

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.429 
you think he's supposed to show depth on
his<00:02:46.590> nose<00:02:46.970> okay<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.840> turn<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> drilling

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
his nose okay just turn the drilling

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.990

alarm and if you notice he has a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.059 
alarm and if you notice he has a
chinstrap<00:02:54.239> -<00:02:55.099> yes<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.640> hole<00:02:56.819> does<00:02:57.000> cap<00:02:57.239> on<00:02:57.450> man

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
chinstrap - yes the hole does cap on man

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.500 
chinstrap - yes the hole does cap on man
it's<00:02:59.069> weird<00:02:59.340> because<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.849> mostly<00:03:00.120> rocket

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it's weird because it's mostly rocket

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
it's weird because it's mostly rocket
robot<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.930> wheels<00:03:01.069> but<00:03:02.069> he's<00:03:02.220> only<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.489> a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
robot on wheels but he's only on a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.130 
robot on wheels but he's only on a
singular<00:03:03.150> wheel<00:03:05.180> true<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.480> wonder<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:06.900> they<00:03:06.989> use

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
singular wheel true I wonder if they use

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.789 
singular wheel true I wonder if they use
the<00:03:07.790> Segway<00:03:08.790> technology<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:10.049> make<00:03:10.260> him<00:03:10.440> stay

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the Segway technology to make him stay

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.740 
the Segway technology to make him stay
up<00:03:11.400> straight<00:03:11.909> at<00:03:12.120> all<00:03:12.239> times<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.659> his

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
up straight at all times when his

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.009 
up straight at all times when his
mustache<00:03:13.230> leans<00:03:13.560> forward<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
mustache leans forward this is the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.649 
mustache leans forward this is the
entrance<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.440> whoopee<00:03:16.829> world

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
entrance to whoopee world

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.240 
entrance to whoopee world
apparently<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.780> first-person<00:03:19.200> view<00:03:19.890> yeah

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
apparently the first-person view yeah

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.399 
apparently the first-person view yeah
it's<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.579> person<00:03:21.090> look<00:03:21.239> around<00:03:21.510> mode<00:03:21.780> parking

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
it's a person look around mode parking

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.250 
it's a person look around mode parking

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
we have a recharge station it's a pretty

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.640 
we have a recharge station it's a pretty
cool<00:04:07.760> idea<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.540> make<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.050> look<00:04:09.140> like<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.319> light

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
cool idea to make it look like a light

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.990 
cool idea to make it look like a light
bulb<00:04:09.890> yeah<00:04:10.520> yeah

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
bulb yeah yeah

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.430 
bulb yeah yeah
these<00:04:14.000> are<00:04:14.209> tinker<00:04:14.599> took<00:04:14.840> at<00:04:14.959> this<00:04:17.380> yeah<00:04:18.380> you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
these are tinker took at this yeah you

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.159 
these are tinker took at this yeah you
can<00:04:18.709> see<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.359> platform's<00:04:20.359> when<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.750> jump<00:04:20.989> on

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
can see the platform's when you jump on

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.520 
can see the platform's when you jump on
them<00:04:21.320> they<00:04:21.530> kind<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:21.980> react<00:04:22.310> in<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:23.530> realistic

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
them they kind of react in a realistic

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.340 
them they kind of react in a realistic
manner<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.889> guess<00:04:25.540> realistic<00:04:26.540> attitude<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.020> lot

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
manner I guess realistic attitude a lot

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.690 
manner I guess realistic attitude a lot
if<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.650> were<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.889> jump<00:04:28.100> on<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> floating

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
if you were to jump on a floating

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.879 
if you were to jump on a floating
platform<00:04:28.940> that's<00:04:29.540> how<00:04:29.690> it<00:04:29.840> would<00:04:29.930> react<00:04:30.230> but

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
platform that's how it would react but

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.230 
platform that's how it would react but
this<00:04:31.010> game<00:04:31.190> was<00:04:31.340> all<00:04:31.520> about<00:04:31.550> its<00:04:32.000> business

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
this game was all about its business

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:42.520 
this game was all about its business
extension<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.110> that's<00:04:39.820> Ono<00:04:40.820> its<00:04:41.000> locks<00:04:41.530> but

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
extension and that's Ono its locks but

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.379 
extension and that's Ono its locks but
there's<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.860> rest<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.250> whoopee<00:04:43.550> world<00:04:43.700> not

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
there's the rest of whoopee world not

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.040 
there's the rest of whoopee world not
really<00:04:44.660> because<00:04:44.930> there's<00:04:45.080> more<00:04:45.260> than<00:04:45.940> just

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
really because there's more than just

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.219 
really because there's more than just
just<00:04:48.050> hidden<00:04:48.290> from<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.800> public<00:04:48.830> eye<00:04:49.280> yep<00:04:53.229> see

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
just hidden from the public eye yep see

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.860 
just hidden from the public eye yep see
they<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:55.669> keys<00:04:55.910> is<00:04:56.090> right<00:04:56.270> here<00:04:56.510> in<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:56.690> nice

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
they the keys is right here in a nice

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.990 
they the keys is right here in a nice
block<00:04:57.290> we<00:04:58.160> can't<00:04:58.430> get<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.729> out<00:04:58.850> quite<00:04:59.210> yet<00:04:59.270> and

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
block we can't get it out quite yet and

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.070 
block we can't get it out quite yet and
there's<00:05:02.000> some<00:05:02.180> nice<00:05:02.300> clipping<00:05:02.780> with<00:05:02.930> the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
there's some nice clipping with the
