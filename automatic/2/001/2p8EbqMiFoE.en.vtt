00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.210
 Gray 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.200
 Well, the truth is that it seemed like a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.780
 very practical motorbike 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.310
 Very economical and very robust is like a 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.250
 motorcycle previously adapted to the new 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 times for me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.810
 comfortable easy to use easy to maintain 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.730
 low consumption and in addition it is very very 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.900
 wearable and very practical I found an 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.900
 motorcycle especially very practical 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.110
 in several senses first the comfort 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.470
 the handlebar extension is very comfortable 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 in the centers quite 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.340
 even though it's hard, it 's pretty 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.560
 comfortable because we have enough miles 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 and kilometers at the same time traveled and 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.060
 it works pretty well it gives me the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.670
 impression that there will be very few 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.230
 true with all the miles we take 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.230
 practically does not lower the needle 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 very light moves without any problem 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.120
 in no time puts you any 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 commitment and then this engine has 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.280
 seemed very balanced with seems 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.869
 lie that the power that has render 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.820
 to everything that can be used later 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 a good exchange relationship 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.410
 studied for city and then even 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.070
 with a fifth a little bit see drive for 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.450
 have good top speed on the road 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.200
 the instrument panel seems to me that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.280
 give enough information with the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.810
 display of the geared gear that 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.729
 I also think it's very useful for people 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.350
 it starts that you have to always have 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.479
 that concern to see in which march they go 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 the only thing I would give him is a small 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.479
 digital watch so I think that's what 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.479
 what is missing for a motorbike citizens 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.490
 we can see it with the handlebar 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.080
 distribution of the stirrups 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.759
 take the legs well you take them 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.370
 on the handlebars the position is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 very natural the engine is going very well I think 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.390
 that the improvements that have been introduced 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.180
 with the balance axis so that it does not vibrate 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.650
 it is so noticeable because we have been a while 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 good giving him that even if it's not a motorcycle 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.220
 to go to fund thing a lot of idea with the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.320
 very high bike of laps and there really 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.300
 where you notice the vibrations 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.860
 note nothing or that is not the detail 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.990
 You want to explain that maintenance is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.510
 very easy easy maintenance that he wants 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.390
 to say that it is fast fast is less 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.800
 hours of labor then say that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.480
 it's cheaper for him for the client 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.480
 final but it's already
