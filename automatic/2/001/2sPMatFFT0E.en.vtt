screen protector and that's about it for

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.020 
screen protector and that's about it for
the<00:00:41.850> box<00:00:42.000> relatively<00:00:42.570> simple<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.460> don't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the box relatively simple so I don't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
the box relatively simple so I don't
really<00:00:45.149> know<00:00:45.300> much<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.870> case<00:00:46.110> yet<00:00:46.379> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
really know much about this case yet so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
really know much about this case yet so
it's<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.340> learning<00:00:47.940> process<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it's going to be a learning process as I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
it's going to be a learning process as I
open<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.910> course<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> iphone

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
open this it is of course for the iphone

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.220 
open this it is of course for the iphone
5<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> let's<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.640> ahead<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.940> into<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:17.710 

looks<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.710> tape<00:00:58.980> here<00:01:10.189> okay

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.590 

all<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> orange

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
all right there it is it's the orange

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.810 
all right there it is it's the orange
one<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.020> comes<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.560> other<00:01:22.799> colors<00:01:23.250> there's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
one it comes in two other colors there's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.660 
one it comes in two other colors there's
one<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> same<00:01:25.200> outside<00:01:25.590> color<00:01:25.830> with

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
one with the same outside color with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
one with the same outside color with
green<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> inside<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.049> white<00:01:28.350> with

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
green on the inside and then white with

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.749 
green on the inside and then white with
blue<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> inside<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.280> far<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> looks

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
blue on the inside so so far it looks

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.249 
blue on the inside so so far it looks
pretty<00:01:33.329> beefy<00:01:33.890> in<00:01:34.890> comparison<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
pretty beefy in comparison to the

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
pretty beefy in comparison to the
defender<00:01:37.259> which<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.460> case<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> I've<00:01:39.299> been

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
defender which is a case that I've been

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
defender which is a case that I've been
using<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> while<00:01:40.259> now<00:01:40.579> I'm<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
using for a while now I'm going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
using for a while now I'm going to
switch<00:01:42.030> over<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> while<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> see

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
switch over to this for a while and see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.340 
switch over to this for a while and see
how<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
how I like it there is actually a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.370 
how I like it there is actually a
lanyard<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> bottom<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.049> do

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
lanyard at the bottom here so you do

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
lanyard at the bottom here so you do
have<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.619> option<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.850> looks<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.030> pretty

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
have that option so looks like a pretty

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.160 
have that option so looks like a pretty
sturdy<00:01:54.990> lanyard<00:01:55.700> um<00:01:57.469> so<00:01:58.469> over<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.310> we've<00:01:59.520> got

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:12.620 

welcome<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.380> Planet<00:02:04.740> outer<00:02:04.890> box

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.790 

okay<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.690> we've<00:02:13.870> got<00:02:13.990> some<00:02:14.170> instructions

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
okay so we've got some instructions

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.330 
okay so we've got some instructions
let's<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.100> what<00:02:15.190> these<00:02:15.310> say<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.950> right<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
let's see what these say all right so

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.559 
let's see what these say all right so
that's<00:02:18.489> probably<00:02:19.150> one<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> most

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
that's probably one of the most

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's probably one of the most
complicated<00:02:20.050> case<00:02:20.980> installation

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
complicated case installation

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.380 
complicated case installation
instructions<00:02:22.450> I've<00:02:22.660> ever<00:02:22.900> seen<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> let's<00:02:25.209> see

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
instructions I've ever seen so let's see

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.770 
instructions I've ever seen so let's see
how<00:02:25.540> well<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.480> I'm<00:02:31.540> guessing

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
how well I can do this so I'm guessing

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:52.800 
how well I can do this so I'm guessing
these<00:02:32.050> are<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.350> latches<00:02:35.370> alright<00:02:51.750> alright<00:02:52.750> i

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
these are the latches alright alright i

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.860 
these are the latches alright alright i
guess<00:02:53.170> it's<00:02:53.470> open<00:02:53.800> now<00:02:57.480> let's<00:02:58.480> get<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.810> out

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
guess it's open now let's get that out

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.410

feel the very tactile though it's not
too<00:03:49.730> bad<00:03:49.910> see<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> lock<00:03:51.140> button<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:52.850> pretty

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
too bad see the lock button it's pretty

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.070 
too bad see the lock button it's pretty
decent<00:03:53.420> considering<00:03:53.870> how<00:03:54.260> thick<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.739> cases

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
decent considering how thick the cases

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.900 
decent considering how thick the cases
volume<00:03:57.080> rockers<00:03:57.410> very<00:03:57.650> good<00:03:57.890> let's<00:03:58.520> try<00:03:58.700> out

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
volume rockers very good let's try out

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.259 
volume rockers very good let's try out
the<00:04:00.100> that's<00:04:01.100> a<00:04:01.340> little<00:04:01.730> bit<00:04:01.850> hard<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> push

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
the that's a little bit hard to push

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.870 
the that's a little bit hard to push
what<00:04:02.450> it's<00:04:02.540> definitely<00:04:02.870> doable<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.700> far

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
what it's definitely doable so so far

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.130 
what it's definitely doable so so far
everything<00:04:05.390> seems<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.690> work<00:04:05.780> pretty<00:04:05.989> well

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
everything seems to work pretty well

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.790 
everything seems to work pretty well
let's<00:04:06.380> try<00:04:06.470> out<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> cameras<00:04:08.800> screen

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
let's try out the cameras screen

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.370 
let's try out the cameras screen
protector<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.690> always<00:04:11.900> there's<00:04:12.170> always<00:04:12.230> a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
protector and always there's always a

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.600 
protector and always there's always a
break-in<00:04:12.620> period<00:04:12.920> with<00:04:13.220> these<00:04:13.340> belts

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
break-in period with these belts

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.629 
break-in period with these belts
built-in<00:04:14.209> screen<00:04:14.420> protectors<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.230> far<00:04:15.639> it

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
built-in screen protectors but so far it

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.310 
built-in screen protectors but so far it
seems<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:17.150> be<00:04:17.209> pretty<00:04:17.359> fun<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:18.049> got<00:04:18.200> that

seems to be pretty fun you got that

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.950 
seems to be pretty fun you got that
sticky<00:04:18.919> sound<00:04:19.639> they<00:04:19.820> always<00:04:20.060> have<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.330> up

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
there I am so all the camera cutouts

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.900 
there I am so all the camera cutouts
look<00:04:25.910> pretty<00:04:26.090> good<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.770> I'm<00:04:28.490> going<00:04:28.639> to<00:04:28.669> test

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
look pretty good so I'm going to test

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.100 
look pretty good so I'm going to test
out<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.360> call<00:04:29.570> quality<00:04:29.810> obviously<00:04:30.800> all<00:04:30.979> the

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
out the call quality obviously all the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.840 
out the call quality obviously all the
resistances<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.470> advertises<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.580> I'll

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
resistances that it advertises and I'll

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.909 
resistances that it advertises and I'll
be<00:04:34.940> back<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.389> review<00:04:35.870> thanks<00:04:36.770> for
