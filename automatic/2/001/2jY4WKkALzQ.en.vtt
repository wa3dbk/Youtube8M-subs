00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.570
 nights depending on what is clear 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.509
 watching this video speaks Carlos and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 continuing with this course where I creed 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.740
 imax good now let's explain 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's say other display modes and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.520
 mainly let's see also how 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.490
 navigate let's say inside what is this 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.759
 tree dimax for I'm here I already created a 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 object that is a cube and let's see 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.790
 other things for example and well is it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.949
 happened to see him in the other chapter by 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.940
 example the some bows also for 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.070
 to be able to navigate within what is this 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.860
 tribune that for example we can 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.360
 besides the east of the bq that we have here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.670
 we have the possibility for 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 example of giving it by learning the button 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.449
 central mouse is the wheel 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.170
 we can if we turn it forward 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.140
 we can come closer 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.570
 we turn it and back we can move away if 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 the oppressed little hand will appear and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.860
 I will be able to move around 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.689
 horizontal or vertical say within 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.939
 the inside of the image within what 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.159
 I'm watching if not by not approaching 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.079
 moving me away simply 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.109
 modifying by moving inside of it 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.630
 ok now well if apart from that cousin 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.780
 the middle button of the mouse cousin the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.770
 alt keyboard button that is cousin 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.689
 art of the keyboard yes and then I press the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.729
 center button or the wheel let's say the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.479
 cousin, what I'm going to be able to do is 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.319
 turn the screen the display of the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.810
 360 degree screen 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.049
 that will replace a little 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 let's see what we say with this view club 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.290
 we have here right maybe it's 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.060
 it can be a little bit even 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.920
 more comfortable to work in this way than 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.170
 be doing this given that if by 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.329
 example know the way of working by 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
 example of this sell that in fact they 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.000
 I recommend and I leave the course that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.270
 he has also been doing over selling 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.890
 in modeling in 3d and all this one 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.659
 they also have the same mode then in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 somehow some measure can reach 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.750
 be this one is very used to work 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 in this way between dimax the others 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.830
 programs have a very similar way 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.710
 to work concretely blender this 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.780
 may also 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.160
 not exactly the same for example in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.090
 those good cases have others 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.740
 first of high control but good is 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.480
 very similar not in terms of how we can 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.130
 just turn on the display of the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.380
 object that we have on the screen ok 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.320
 now for example let's see what 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.660
 when we get closer we approach in the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.190
 image by means of the mouse does it by 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.800
 half of jumps as we see here I 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.220
 when I give one, it approaches me or drives 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.750
 let's say how in sections ok if I 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.220
 I want this to make it soft because such 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.900
 once we want more detail and we want 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790
 find just the center point 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.120
 right point let's do it with 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.450
 control alt and we turn the wheel towards 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.450
 in front of 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.740
 and this is going to be softer maybe not 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.510
 is appreciated in the video because this 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.380
 two reasons at first because I in my 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.940
 machine 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.190
 I'm a bit forced, let's say 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.100
 saying is the forced way to the moment 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
 to be doing this in trini max that 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.060
 it brings a lot of memory and at the same time 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.650
 I'm recording good and good time 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.720
 to my machine because it is also already 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.610
 let's say it is not exceeded in resources 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.110
 not then obviously so good 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.520
 this makes it not look so good today 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.810
 aside as it is a video remember the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.110
 fluids even less by means of 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.250
 frames and this per second and everything 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.050
 this and well, that is not enough 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.660
 see but when you do it in 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.970
 alt control and with the casters approaching or 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 they go away they will see that it is softer than 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 when they do it only the pure 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.850
 little wheel with the rita are only 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.060
 as bounce ok well well what else are we going 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.980
 Let's see 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.690
 now for example here I have created 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.459
 other objects like me I can select 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.050
 let's see that this is not directly 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.630
 we can be directly the keyboard 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.670
 q suppress the same time with the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.480
 mouse we select one we see that 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.870
 we can select the objects ok if 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.450
 we press w and select we see that 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.930
 change our cursor mode and we 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.519
 they appear just the three this axes x 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.400
 yz therefore brings him to power 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.400
 move it on a particular axis yes 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.150
 and we see it this way then 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.740
 can we simply move them 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.449
 by any of the axes according to 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.560
 interest 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.300
 now well if we give the r and 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.159
 we select another we see that changes us 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.810
 also the way with this what we 're going to 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:39.070
 power is just to scale 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.070
 on one of the axes 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.590
 Now, if we give it to the 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.940
 what we will do is rotate must 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.830
 Be careful with this because maybe 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.190
 confuse us the r think that it will be 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.510
 rotate and scale but it 's upside down the r 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.710
 is to scale and the e is to rotate ok 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.570
 then do not confuse us 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.160
 remember that this is in English so 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.930
 So much does not have to do 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.850
 let's say with the initials of 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.680
 Spanish words first thing we're going 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.370
 to think since with r it is to rotate and 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.790
 it's not climbing and with that ska this rotate 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.680
 ok let's give such 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.680
 and here I am I rotate 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.960
 And we're going to give it to be scalar 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.759
 you have to be careful with it and you have to 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.580
 be aware of this not of what is not 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.750
 it's not exactly what it says if we go 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.360
 to put for example here we are going to climb 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.370
 okay 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.810
 and well for now it would be all in 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.819
 Regarding this navigation we are going to 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.159
 have us let's say possible in each 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.319
 one of our objects with the let's say 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.400
 direct with the different accesses 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.199
 direct that we're going to have own 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.270
 Keyboard invite you to continue watching 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.770
 this course on the climax also os 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.629
 I invite you to subscribe tld in which 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.770
 share and if you are interested also 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.659
 I invite all of us courses that I have 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.370
 also created 3d modeling as 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.719
 wish to blender with the program 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.080
 blender that is from the consortium which 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:07.389
 I recommend a lot because the truth is that 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.490
 is the free version we have these this 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.900
 commercial but the truth is that it does not have 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.210
 nothing to envy the versions 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.680
 commercial and it is already a course that already 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.719
 has created I already have about 50 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.779
 chapters this part just like in this 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:24.069
 part from the most basic to aspects 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:26.169
 more advanced stella and even 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.819
 understand each other we are the idea is 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.949
 just get there just to arrive 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.599
 only animations and photos realism 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.599
 but even see some gaming 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.750
 different things 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.510
 well for now it would be everything and even 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.510
 the next
