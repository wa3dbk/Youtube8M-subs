00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.700
 I 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.020
 franck chevrel hello so I 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.360
 looked full of questions to ask 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.990
 is actually how you arrived at the pinnacle of 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.730
 his career 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.300
 I thought to myself when was 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.800
 even one more model a guitar that te 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.270
 fantasize that you have not yet 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.330
 realized no I can not answer you to 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.120
 this because in fact I say them 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.890
 today and even the guitar that 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.230
 I'm interested in the one that's going on 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.969
 of manufacture which I think a priori 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.679
 who will always be a 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.550
 interest me from tomorrow what else 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.460
 I stop 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.290
 so here I just finished a model 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.500
 which I called annabelle a wave a 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.090
 artist artist friend so here's that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.649
 I would like declined in several woods 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.360
 maybe maybe to propose them 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.420
 to the shops for expanding a little 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.250
 my presentation montchamp that the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.230
 people know my guitars via the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.290
 media via maybe some artists 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.940
 but we do not necessarily necessarily 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.759
 also meet a production when 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.790
 even limited so that's so I'm 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.560
 rather in there right now but 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.000
 why not I'll have two next 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.700
 week I have a lot of projects while 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.429
 the peculiarity of this annabelle model 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.929
 compared to others 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.700
 I hesitated a lot to change the line 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.560
 of the guitar and then after I got 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.259
 says the horse and the head it's a way 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.850
 easy identification so especially 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.310
 for the stores so I thought I 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.509
 not going to bump up at one is trying to 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.270
 create a new line although I 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.899
 had a strong urge but so that's 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 rather in a kind of finishing a little 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.550
 fine and discreet but at the same time 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.860
 refined tries to mix this 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.600
 elegance that we can have with a little bit of 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.960
 nac but not too much not too much 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.869
 and if not at the level of the woods I would like 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.460
 show with bd a violin 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.829
 relatively simple to make 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.770
 guitars with top level woods for 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.850
 that the guitar is valued 2 of the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.159
 side of this materials 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.330
 agreement building then 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.790
 now I would like to have a little tone 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.050
 father look I would not say grand father 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.350
 still the violin 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.310
 but especially young luthier who who 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.510
 can be here because there are some 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.319
 a lot that I myself did not know 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.150
 so I think it's going to be a little 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.500
 the same for you who come a little bit 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.550
 all over 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 what do you think of their job 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.520
 overall and how do you see that's it 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.920
 the state of the lutherie in France good for 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.150
 I think it's a bit uneven 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.950
 there are really very good things 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.360
 things a little mean and what is 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 you think 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.400
 but the problem is to arrive 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.690
 to start so there is a tool 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.890
 great for all those people who 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 starts there are people doing the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 violin for three four years there is 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.650
 here is their first exhibition 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.660
 so obviously it's very important 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.300
 for them to arrive in a kind of 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.709
 large corporations then in getting 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 actually walking down what you 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.310
 do you see things a little disparate 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.620
 things that are still school 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 others are more control 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.970
 small mistakes of the times technique of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.769
 two little nonsense in the east in the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.390
 woodworking things or the facts 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.540
 the son of wood and not always respected 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.900
 the same good anyway there is a 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.510
 great work behind even 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.640
 an instrument that still remains a little 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.530
 school but I think there is some 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.209
 all the musicians a guitar 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.900
 clumsy not done but that is done 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.700
 with a lot of excited about and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.739
 of intelligence can have a result 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.409
 also excellent it's not always 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.780
 that's the aspect of both definition and 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.480
 by the most important aspect 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.650
 so how would you pass the violin 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.939
 French compared to the violin 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950
 European in general because as you 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.750
 the know there was gb who prepares the holy 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.790
 grail so the salon with 115 luthier 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.280
 so there's going to be really a strong 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.659
 competition and how do you position a 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.930
 little French know-how compared 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.280
 to other useful European listening to a 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.290
 I told them we had 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.940
 the vence because for doing 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.220
 a few lounges in Frankfurt there are ten 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
 fifteen years we were far from ridiculous 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.829
 on the contrary 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.450
 and then Germany had a longer side 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.639
 hard rock they were more present in 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.120
 the in the electric guitar side by 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.150
 example 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.310
 today, in my opinion, everything has happened 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.200
 globalized so I do not imagine you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.150
 for one moment that they have not and we 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.790
 knows some very great luthiers in 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.049
 belgium because we are talking about 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.789
 same language and knows the reports are 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.530
 simpler for Switzerland is a country 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.270
 smaller in say is more 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.039
 confidential maybe well that people 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.780
 who work very well but good 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.090
 Obviously we had in England or 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.980
 in Germany there are some people 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.570
 great but in my opinion they have the 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.150
 same provinces and it seems that we are 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.710
 same problems 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.120
 Germany may have this advantage 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.250
 to have Frankfurt and to have this 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.020
 species the European importers are 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.120
 there and I think the market 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.340
 it's a richer country so the market 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.900
 of this luxury we will say because it 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.860
 still a little bit 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.360
 confidential 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.629
 and maybe it's a big market 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.039
 peasant this benefit thank you very much 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.370
 franck to have granted these little 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.370
 moments
