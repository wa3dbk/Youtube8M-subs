00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.550 

I<00:03:28.160> bend<00:03:29.160> them<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> bit<00:03:30.860> right<00:03:32.990> should<00:03:33.990> go<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.350> out

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
I bend them a bit right should go in out

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.430 
I bend them a bit right should go in out
here<00:03:35.840> let's<00:03:36.840> see

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
going to unplug it from the main then I

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.220 
going to unplug it from the main then I
go<00:04:05.159> up<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.519> screws<00:04:05.790> now<00:04:06.030> I'm<00:04:06.930> going<00:04:07.170> to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
go up to the screws now I'm going to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:43.839 
go up to the screws now I'm going to
check<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.560> first

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.790

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.309 
it all works fine now so that's very
easy<00:04:51.349> and<00:04:53.449> probably<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.509> quickest<00:04:54.840> way<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.020> do

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319

unplug<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.199> from<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> main<00:05:11.539> and<00:05:12.740> put<00:05:13.740> all<00:05:13.919> them

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
unplug it from the main and put all them

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.710 
unplug it from the main and put all them
screws<00:05:15.110> back<00:05:16.110> on<00:05:16.289> their<00:05:16.440> places
