just was so dry so then I discovered
green<00:00:49.649> teeth<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.629> that's<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:51.840> I've<00:00:51.930> been

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
green teeth and that's what I've been

using for about a year now and it works

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.410 
using for about a year now and it works
just<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.500> well<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.980> benzoyl<00:00:56.430> peroxide<00:00:56.670> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
just as well as benzoyl peroxide it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
just as well as benzoyl peroxide it's
not<00:00:57.660> better<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.070> redness<00:00:59.550> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
irritation after it so that's a little

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.450 
irritation after it so that's a little
better<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.579> my<00:01:02.699> opinion<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:04.379> mean<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the one thing about green tea is it will

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.880

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.510 
all over the place the walls the same to
the<00:04:05.430> counter<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:07.170> was<00:04:07.319> not<00:04:07.500> fun<00:04:07.770> so<00:04:08.160> I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
the counter and that was not fun so I

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.570 
the counter and that was not fun so I
started<00:04:09.510> using<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:10.110> squeeze<00:04:10.860> bottle<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.459> I

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
started using the squeeze bottle and I

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.570 
started using the squeeze bottle and I
saw<00:04:11.970> how<00:04:12.270> well<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.720> worked<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.620> kept

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
saw how well it worked and I just kept

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.210 
saw how well it worked and I just kept
you<00:04:14.760> thinking<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.209> didn't<00:04:15.540> even<00:04:15.859> go<00:04:16.859> back<00:04:17.040> to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
you thinking I didn't even go back to

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.560 
you thinking I didn't even go back to
the<00:04:17.340> spray<00:04:17.579> bottle<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.810> that's<00:04:19.560> what<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.829> do<00:04:19.890> and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
the spray bottle so that's what I do and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.780 
the spray bottle so that's what I do and
like<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.600> said<00:04:21.780> they're<00:04:22.280> basically<00:04:23.280> what<00:04:23.640> i<00:04:23.669> do

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
like I said they're basically what i do

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.120 
like I said they're basically what i do
if<00:04:24.150> i<00:04:24.270> do<00:04:24.330> use<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.960> moisturizer<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.890> don't

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
if i do use the moisturizer and I don't

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.760 
if i do use the moisturizer and I don't
always<00:04:26.370> put<00:04:26.940> 11<00:04:27.360> afterwards<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.260> i'm<00:04:28.380> going<00:04:28.590> to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
always put 11 afterwards if i'm going to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.190 
always put 11 afterwards if i'm going to
leave<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.100> health<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.490> definitely<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:31.169> I

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
leave the health I definitely do but I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.150 
leave the health I definitely do but I
wait<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.330> tea<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.540> dry<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.230> then<00:04:34.290> though

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
wait for the tea to dry and then though

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.890 
wait for the tea to dry and then though
there<00:04:35.550> will<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.730> slight<00:04:35.820> tightness<00:04:36.570> but

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
there will be a slight tightness but

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.750 
there will be a slight tightness but

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.940 
like I said as soon as I put on the
moisturizer<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.930> dryness<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680

out<00:04:49.410> something<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.919> works<00:04:50.130> better<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:51.419> my

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
out something that works better in my

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.330 
out something that works better in my
opinion<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.440> don't<00:04:52.950> have<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.250> ear

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340

attention<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.570> I'm<00:04:54.930> hopefully<00:04:55.470> it'll<00:04:55.890> work

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
attention so I'm hopefully it'll work
