00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
disease well you have said moderation

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170 
disease well you have said moderation
probably<00:02:19.780> about<00:02:19.990> 10<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.190> key<00:02:21.550> it's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
probably about 10 that is the key it's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.210 
probably about 10 that is the key it's
very<00:02:22.420> important<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.020> how<00:02:23.200> often<00:02:23.530> if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.010> do

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220

example<00:03:07.209> has<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.600> higher<00:03:07.900> antioxidant<00:03:08.350> content

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
example has a higher antioxidant content

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.789 
example has a higher antioxidant content
than<00:03:09.310> red<00:03:09.519> wine<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.290> Concord<00:03:11.290> grape<00:03:11.350> juice

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
than red wine and Concord grape juice

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.979 
than red wine and Concord grape juice
100%<00:03:12.519> was<00:03:12.640> very<00:03:12.850> close<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.420> red<00:03:13.570> wine<00:03:13.750> as<00:03:13.959> well

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
100% was very close to red wine as well

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.080 
100% was very close to red wine as well
so<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> lot<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.160> options<00:03:15.459> let's<00:03:15.880> talk

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
so you have a lot of options let's talk

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.490 
so you have a lot of options let's talk
about<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.480> differences<00:03:16.840> between<00:03:16.900> red<00:03:17.320> wine

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
about the differences between red wine

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.490 
about the differences between red wine
and<00:03:17.680> white<00:03:17.860> wine<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.910> white<00:03:19.480> wine<00:03:19.660> as<00:03:19.900> good<00:03:20.260> for

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
and white wine is white wine as good for

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.560 
and white wine is white wine as good for
you<00:03:20.620> as<00:03:20.860> red<00:03:21.130> wine<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.579> actually<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.150> now

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
you as red wine it actually is now

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.240 
you as red wine it actually is now
that's<00:03:22.930> surprising<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.560> some<00:03:23.739> people<00:03:24.070> because

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
that's surprising to some people because

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.410 
that's surprising to some people because
you<00:03:24.340> always<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.850> red<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.030> really

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
you always think the red is really

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.240 
you always think the red is really
important<00:03:25.840> for<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.620> beautiful<00:03:26.980> pigment

has those antioxidants it does have more

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.590 
has those antioxidants it does have more
antioxidants<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:30.519> there<00:03:30.940> was<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.120> spanish

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
antioxidants but there was a spanish

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.940 
antioxidants but there was a spanish
study<00:03:31.870> that<00:03:32.049> looked<00:03:32.320> at<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.500> difference

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
study that looked at the difference

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.160 
study that looked at the difference
between<00:03:33.310> these<00:03:33.400> two<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.940> health<00:03:34.150> benefits<00:03:34.720> so

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
between these two and health benefits so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.690 
between these two and health benefits so
these<00:03:35.320> lucky<00:03:35.650> women<00:03:35.980> were<00:03:36.130> recruited<00:03:36.609> to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
these lucky women were recruited to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.789 
these lucky women were recruited to
drink<00:03:36.910> wine<00:03:37.120> every<00:03:37.510> day<00:03:37.720> for<00:03:38.019> four<00:03:38.260> weeks<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
drink wine every day for four weeks and

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.229 
drink wine every day for four weeks and
what<00:03:39.160> they<00:03:39.280> found<00:03:39.430> at<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.700> end<00:03:39.820> of<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:39.970> study

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
what they found at the end of the study

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.420 
what they found at the end of the study
is<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:40.480> both<00:03:40.930> groups<00:03:41.320> red<00:03:41.769> wine<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.220> white

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
is that both groups red wine and white

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.130 
is that both groups red wine and white
wine<00:03:42.459> drinkers<00:03:43.060> had<00:03:43.269> an<00:03:43.420> increase<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:44.019> their

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
wine drinkers had an increase in their

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.680 
wine drinkers had an increase in their
HDL<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.829> good<00:03:45.010> cholesterol<00:03:45.390> which<00:03:46.390> is<00:03:46.510> very

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
HDL the good cholesterol which is very

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.930 
HDL the good cholesterol which is very
heart<00:03:46.930> protective<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.709> they<00:03:48.040> also<00:03:48.220> both<00:03:48.670> had

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
heart protective and they also both had

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.660 
heart protective and they also both had
reduced<00:03:49.329> blood<00:03:49.720> markers<00:03:50.140> for<00:03:50.350> inflammation

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
reduced blood markers for inflammation

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.280 
reduced blood markers for inflammation
which<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.850> know<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.150> kind<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.630> known<00:03:52.900> trigger

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
which we know is kind of a known trigger

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.039 
which we know is kind of a known trigger
of<00:03:53.530> aging<00:03:54.070> and<00:03:54.190> disease<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:55.239> good<00:03:55.540> news<00:03:55.720> for<00:03:56.019> a

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
of aging and disease so good news for a

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.319 
of aging and disease so good news for a
white<00:03:56.200> wine<00:03:56.410> lover<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.040> white<00:03:57.459> wine<00:03:57.640> has<00:03:57.910> fewer

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
white wine lover so white wine has fewer

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.069 
white wine lover so white wine has fewer
sulfites

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
sulfites

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.050 
sulfites
it<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.470> especially<00:03:59.769> dry<00:04:00.280> white<00:04:00.609> wine<00:04:00.790> so

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
it is especially dry white wine so

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.490 
it is especially dry white wine so
sulfides<00:04:01.780> are<00:04:01.870> something<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.290> are

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
sulfides are something that are

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.170 
sulfides are something that are
generally<00:04:03.040> added<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.459> wine<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.820> help<00:04:03.970> preserve

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
generally added to wine to help preserve

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.520 
generally added to wine to help preserve
it<00:04:04.420> but<00:04:04.720> they're<00:04:04.870> actually<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.290> normal

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
it but they're actually a normal

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.590 
it but they're actually a normal
byproduct<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.519> wine<00:04:06.700> making<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.450> there's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
byproduct of wine making so there's

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.509 
byproduct of wine making so there's
really<00:04:07.750> no<00:04:08.019> such<00:04:08.260> thing<00:04:08.290> as<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.650> sulfite<00:04:09.160> free

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
really no such thing as a sulfite free

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.520 
really no such thing as a sulfite free
wine<00:04:09.790> so<00:04:10.329> if<00:04:10.420> you're<00:04:10.570> sensitive<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.230> can<00:04:11.380> go

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
wine so if you're sensitive you can go

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.960 
wine so if you're sensitive you can go
with<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.799> dry<00:04:12.010> whites<00:04:12.340> or<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.820> go<00:04:12.940> with

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
with the dry whites or you can go with

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.430 
with the dry whites or you can go with
organic<00:04:13.720> because<00:04:14.349> they're<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:14.739> allowed<00:04:15.010> to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
organic because they're not allowed to

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.020 
organic because they're not allowed to
sulfites<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:15.920> organic<00:04:16.310> wine<00:04:16.519> well<00:04:16.850> we're

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
sulfites and organic wine well we're

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.970 
sulfites and organic wine well we're
seeing<00:04:17.330> a<00:04:17.390> lot<00:04:17.600> more<00:04:17.630> organic<00:04:18.260> wines<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.830> the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
seeing a lot more organic wines on the

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.380 
seeing a lot more organic wines on the
market<00:04:19.400> or<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.940> better<00:04:20.060> for<00:04:20.269> you

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
market or is it better for you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.440 
market or is it better for you
definitely<00:04:21.200> because<00:04:21.650> regular<00:04:22.450> winemaking

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
definitely because regular winemaking

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.150 
definitely because regular winemaking
grapes<00:04:23.780> are<00:04:23.930> exposed<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.470> wide<00:04:24.680> range<00:04:25.010> of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
grapes are exposed to a wide range of

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.780 
grapes are exposed to a wide range of
pesticides<00:04:25.820> herbicides<00:04:26.650> fungicides<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:28.370> fact

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
pesticides herbicides fungicides in fact

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.270 
pesticides herbicides fungicides in fact
in<00:04:28.940> California<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.050> top<00:04:30.260> 50<00:04:30.710> pesticides

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
in California of the top 50 pesticides

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.060 
in California of the top 50 pesticides
that<00:04:31.370> are<00:04:31.490> used<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.880> winemaking<00:04:32.710> 17<00:04:33.710> are

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
that are used in winemaking 17 are

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.100 
that are used in winemaking 17 are
considered<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.610> be<00:04:34.640> very<00:04:34.970> toxic<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.750> one<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.080> a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
considered to be very toxic and one is a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.470 
considered to be very toxic and one is a
known<00:04:36.410> cancer<00:04:36.830> Kyser<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.060> can<00:04:38.210> go<00:04:38.330> with

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
known cancer Kyser so you can go with

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.720 
known cancer Kyser so you can go with
organic<00:04:38.990> that's<00:04:39.440> even<00:04:39.680> better<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.550> what

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
organic that's even better and so what

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.400 
organic that's even better and so what
should<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.060> look<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.270> on<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.540> label<00:04:41.660> look

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
should you look for on the label look
