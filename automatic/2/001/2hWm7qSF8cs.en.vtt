00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
you know it's very distinct flavor but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.140

not<00:02:28.240> overbearing<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.380> me<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.820> just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
not overbearing to me it's not just

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.670 
not overbearing to me it's not just
tomato<00:02:31.450> juice<00:02:31.660> usually<00:02:32.080> with<00:02:32.170> bloody<00:02:32.380> marys

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
that's what I find is it's just tomato

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.900 
that's what I find is it's just tomato
juice<00:02:34.990> but<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.890> has<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.400> much<00:02:36.520> more<00:02:36.730> flavor

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
juice but this has so much more flavor

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.270 
juice but this has so much more flavor
to<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.570> it's<00:02:38.200> perfect<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.650> our<00:02:38.800> pilots<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to it and it's perfect for our pilots I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.660
