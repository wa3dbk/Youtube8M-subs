00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.299
 hello today I propose you to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.000
 to make a folding of towels in 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.520
 boat shape to achieve our 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 folding we simply need to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.770
 paper napkins of the color that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 you want to start our folding 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.779
 we will take the towel like this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 with the diamond tip down and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.050
 all the leaves that we can see 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.089
 before you first step we go 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 simply bent this tip on the 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:41.519
 opposite slope like those one mark 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.369
 well the crease and then we will imagine 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.850
 a line starting from the edge of the triangle 

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:53.909
 to the middle and we're going to fold like 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.809
 these we mark well the fold and we do 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.809
 the same on the other side 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.960
 we notice that both parts are 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 well joined and not spaces and if not the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.750
 folding will not work then one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.490
 return book we get two small 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.899
 ears that we will fold on the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.350
 triangle formed like this 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:27.119
 again we mark the fold well and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.700
 we do the same on the other side it does not 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.979
 we just have to bend in this direction 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 we imagine a line in the middle and we 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:40.050
 fold the triangle on itself as 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.690
 these one gets another triangle 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.369
 smaller canton holds the triangle 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.590
 like this we realize that all 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.429
 the sheets of the towel are at 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.560
 middle of the book 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.630
 we'll just unfold them 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.259
 after the others to figure the sails 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.330
 Of the boat 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.020
 so we just draw them to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.979
 self slowly to avoid 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.979
 tear the paper towel 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.060
 then marbles a little the sails as 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.519
 we wish it to form the boat and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 here is our finalized folding so if we 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.420
 wants to realize at the same time a marc 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.160
 place enough bread for example 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.190
 it's a small clothespin 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.209
 at this level here and register the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.950
 first name of the guest 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.019
