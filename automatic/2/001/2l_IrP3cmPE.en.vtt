00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I'm doing three and this was like my

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.220 
I'm doing three and this was like my
most<00:00:26.039> viewed<00:00:26.430> video<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.930> two

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
most viewed video it had over like two

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
most viewed video it had over like two
million<00:00:28.500> views<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.160> YouTube<00:00:29.730> hates<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.150> they

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
million views and YouTube hates me they

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
million views and YouTube hates me they
took<00:00:30.480> down<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.840> video<00:00:31.109> who<00:00:31.800> knows<00:00:32.009> why<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
took down that video who knows why but

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
took down that video who knows why but
it's<00:00:33.270> gone<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> can't<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> back<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it's gone and I can't get it back so I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530 
it's gone and I can't get it back so I
figured<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> people<00:00:35.940> must<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.360> like

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
figured a lot of people must really like

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
figured a lot of people must really like
to<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.380> million<00:00:37.680> views<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to see it if it had two million views so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
to see it if it had two million views so
I'm<00:00:38.640> doing<00:00:38.910> another<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.690> hope<00:00:39.899> you

tutorials<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.140> first<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.039> probably

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
tutorials so first off this is probably

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
tutorials so first off this is probably
the<00:00:47.550> most<00:00:47.579> tight<00:00:48.090> bun<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the most tight bun I use this a lot in

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.939 
the most tight bun I use this a lot in
lower<00:00:49.950> side<00:00:50.430> buns<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.500> just

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
lower side buns and what you do is just

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
lower side buns and what you do is just
twist<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> base<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.420> hair<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
twist from the base of your hair all the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
twist from the base of your hair all the
way<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> tie<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
way you don't need to tie it in a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
way you don't need to tie it in a
ponytail<00:00:57.149> holder<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.870> anything<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.559> then

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
ponytail holder or anything and then

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
ponytail holder or anything and then
just<00:00:59.219> wrap<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.550> around<00:00:59.820> itself<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.719> super

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
just wrap it around itself it's super

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.080 
just wrap it around itself it's super
easy<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.920> stays<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.520> together<00:01:02.850> when

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
easy and it all stays in together when

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.119 
easy and it all stays in together when
you<00:01:03.180> twist<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.890> just

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you twist it like that and then just

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
you twist it like that and then just
wrap<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.369> hair<00:01:05.729> tie<00:01:05.970> around<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
wrap your hair tie around it and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
wrap your hair tie around it and
normally<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.890> use<00:01:08.159> one<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.790> bobby

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
normally I just use one or two bobby

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.480 
normally I just use one or two bobby
pins<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.200> sure<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.619> stays<00:01:10.920> close<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
pins just to make sure it stays close to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.640 
pins just to make sure it stays close to
my<00:01:11.640> head<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> nice<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> tight<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> can

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
my head and nice and tight but you can

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
my head and nice and tight but you can
pull<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> even<00:01:15.060> Messier

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
pull this out and make it even Messier

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539 
pull this out and make it even Messier
but<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.799> looks<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> nice

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.200 
but I think just this looks like a nice
kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> loose<00:01:18.830> small<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:20.220> top<00:01:20.729> knot<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
kind of loose small little top knot I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
kind of loose small little top knot I
think<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.780> adorable<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> next<00:01:23.729> look<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
think it's adorable this next look is a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
think it's adorable this next look is a
little<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.659> messy<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> push
