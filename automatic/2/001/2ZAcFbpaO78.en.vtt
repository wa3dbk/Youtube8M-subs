00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.560
 a real man can't do without 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.719
 An interesting hobby for someone is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.719
 cars for someone this football well i 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.700
 chose for myself fishing what could be 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.570
 better to put in the morning waiting 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 good bite 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.270
 but so that the fishing would not spoil the fish 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 need of course to feed the most 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.269
 common way who knew 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.090
 even our grandfathers 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.510
 it take a little crumb and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.059
 dip it in the water until the fish is 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.670
 swam closer but technical progress 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 do not stand still it's time to forget about 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 bread crumbs them in cages and is it worth 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 translate a good product 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.090
 notice progressive 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 novelty in the field of fishing electronic 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 fish bait fish magnet this 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.840
 bait is an alternative 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 habitual for anglers biological 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.210
 bait such as bread porridge dough and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.969
 the like but electronic 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 bait more convenient to use 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.450
 reduces the duration 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 preparing for fishing giving the opportunity 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.760
 spend more time directly 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 catching this electronic bait is good 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.350
 moreover, that eliminates the risk of overfeeding 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 fish that always exists when 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 using ordinary bait at the end 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.180
 all, she just saves you money 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.439
 because with careful use 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.229
 e bait fish magnet she 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.270
 will serve you more than one year when loaf 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 there is only enough white bread for you 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 once the instrument task is to lure the fish into 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.530
 fishing area from another part of the reservoir 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.079
 the result of catching straight Nina fish 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.390
 depends on all the factors on which 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.799
 depends fishing at all times and in any 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.159
 spot gear 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.399
 bait experience fisherman luck and so on 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.049
 thus using the instrument 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.750
 increases the chances of a fisher to succeed in 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.320
 no fish fishing together while maintaining 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.270
 this intrigue of the process of catching 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 You can use fish magnet like 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.350
 in the winter and in the summer you can fish 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 both on the river and on the lake and on the sea 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.379
 because fish magnet is easy to handle 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 like fresh 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.640
 so from salt water fish magnet 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.319
 powered by special 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.239
 battery with a lot of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.900
 recharge cycles well charging this 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.940
 the battery lasts up to 150 hours 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.040
 continuous work agree it is more 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.020
 what's enough to go 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 fishing even for a few days 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.739
 the recharge process takes less than an hour 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.230
 as soon as the electronic bait 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.930
 turns in the water it starts to work 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.269
 automatically switch role in this 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.980
 case that performs water which 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.770
 known superbly holds 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.800
 electricity 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.450
 the total so the device turns on as 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 between electrical contacts only 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.250
 on the red end cap of the device 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.560
 it turns out the water must be borne in mind that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.190
 water conductivity is much lower than 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.500
 metal 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.900
 therefore, the signals generated by the device 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.530
 water is significantly weaker than those that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.330
 it emits when closing contacts 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.010
 metal object however need not 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.750
 forget that the senses of the fish 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.730
 significantly more susceptible to 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 signals generated by the device than 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.250
 human let's consider by 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.560
 why does a fish magnet help so well 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.320
 fishermen in fishing primarily here 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.530
 works all known methods 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.870
 bait 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.810
 fish and fish magnet act on 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.560
 natural instincts of fish and on each of 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.550
 they are separately this sight and hearing 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.270
 electromagnetic sensitivity 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.390
 signal 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.280
 and sensitivity to vibration let's 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.890
 consider how it all works 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.050
 flashing bright LED periodically 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.000
 directly affects the vision of fish and 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.670
 will be especially effective in the dark 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.980
 days or in clear rivers where noise 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.070
 currents can dim effect from 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.270
 vibration and beep 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.360
 acoustic impact by 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.209
 matched during experiments sound 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.050
 low frequency waves produced by bait 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.840
 distributed in fresh water on 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.350
 distance up to 900 meters and in the sea 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.209
 salt water up to 1100 meters this effect 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.290
 becomes very effective when 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.020
 using the device 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.510
 muddied them or completely not transparent 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.000
 mechanical vibrations in waters 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.280
 generate a device spread in 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.380
 aqueous medium acting on the lateral 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.870
 fish line a weak pulse 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.910
 electromagnetic signal is having 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.560
 effects on fish nerves 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.620
 which in combination with the rest 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.080
 signals attracts fish located in 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.300
 zone of action thanks to this 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.430
 complex effects of fish all 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.440
 receptors feel pleasant to her 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.720
 e bait exposure 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.270
 after which it approaches the device from 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.570
 remote parts of the reservoir and circling in 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.570
 radius of 1 20 meters around it 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.600
 it is very simple to turn off the device 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.800
 just take it out of the water and wipe it 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.530
 dry 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.540
 well now let's look at this 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.390
 the device is closer it has a cylindrical 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.180
