00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 how simple it is to make 12 snacks 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 cost less than 2 50 each far and the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 best of all it takes no more than 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.770
 ten minutes to prepare these snacks 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 16 steps only four ingredients 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.610
 anyone who does not have any 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 practice in the kitchen to prepare is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 very easy then I want you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.329
 I came here because I'll show 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.950
 you like you do and how you will you 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.480
 see how easy it is to prepare 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.480
 all this then let's go 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 we are coconut milk 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 the staff then spent two hours here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.709
 People are going to show I 'm going to show them to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.170
 How are you going to cut those 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.909
 Aquila bays are ideally situated for 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.329
 you use in your day to day 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.819
 so let's go and I here with an easy to 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:45.549
 butter no longer leaves room here in the 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.560
 cheek of the theater efe missing son 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.049
 that our protein bar I go 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.430
 make the first drawing of the bars I 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.430
 I want it here with the knife. 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.530
 I'm going to cut 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.879
 I disagree in this way here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.780
 the bars here you can store 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.780
 they in the pot then put in the refrigerator 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:24.700
 are not practical healthy angels of 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.319
 prepared take less than ten 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.349
 minutes 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.599
 so there the staff is not here 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.280
 I'll separate these bars here. 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.010
 then I will keep longer care I will 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.530
 leave in the refrigerator because they last 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.989
 It could last more so, that 's it. 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.160
 is here the 12 boats that I promised to 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.530
 you 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.900
 they do not actually cost more than 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.489
 two reais and 50 on average depending on 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.099
 where you buy each of the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.890
 ingredients only four emerging 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.019
 six steps is very simple to prepare 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.690
 so you can watch this video 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.690
 check the step by step of 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.230
 How is this protein bar made? 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.930
 I want to talk here if you have a friend. 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.790
 which is in the same situation as you 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.609
 You have time to eat form 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.650
 healthy or want to save money 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.030
 want to save time by preparing their 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.489
 own snacks 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.410
 you can pick up indicate need friends 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.430
 here because I guarantee it will be a 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.590
 very useful solution for each of them 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.460
 where they will be able to feed themselves 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.550
 family in some way without having 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.460
 problems with readings or problems with 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.849
 sweet that is what ends up denigrating or 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.800
 giving that extra fat in the body in the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.340
 your body taking into account your friends 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.470
 so after you've done that long 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.690
 They also debated that you leave your 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.690

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.450

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.100
 possible for you then with 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.220

 not happening to me and my team to 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.910
 people will be able to improve this and every 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.100
 offered lunches dinners lunches at 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.790
 increasingly fast and 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.380
 cockroaches
