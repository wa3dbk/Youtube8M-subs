to<00:01:55.799> select<00:01:56.009> any<00:01:56.340> track<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> let's<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.439> ahead

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to select any track so let's go ahead

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.289 
to select any track so let's go ahead
and<00:01:58.829> select<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.219> track<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.729> gonna<00:01:59.820> load<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and select a track we're gonna load it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.800 
and select a track we're gonna load it
up<00:02:00.420> load<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:02.270> tractor<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.659> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
up load a in tractor when you have your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.499 
up load a in tractor when you have your
four<00:02:04.079> decks<00:02:04.320> it'll<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:05.700> deck<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.270> will

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
four decks it'll be your deck one will

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.550 
four decks it'll be your deck one will
be<00:02:06.659> two<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.469> deck<00:02:08.629> deck<00:02:09.629> B<00:02:09.899> will<00:02:10.410> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
be two and your deck deck B will be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800 
be two and your deck deck B will be
three<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> little<00:02:11.790> odd<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.209> that's<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
three it's a little odd but that's the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.870 
three it's a little odd but that's the
way<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.020> set<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.319> up<00:02:13.410> and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
way they set it up and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.240 
way they set it up and
kind<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.210> it's<00:02:14.900> easy<00:02:15.170> because<00:02:15.380> you're<00:02:15.950> mixing

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
kind of it's easy because you're mixing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.490 
kind of it's easy because you're mixing
with<00:02:16.400> these<00:02:16.550> two<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.510> closer<00:02:17.900> wants<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.380> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
with these two so the closer wants it to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
with these two so the closer wants it to
me<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.710> kind<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.890> makes<00:02:19.070> sense<00:02:19.130> even<00:02:20.000> though

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
me it kind of makes sense even though

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.080 
me it kind of makes sense even though
you<00:02:20.180> would<00:02:20.360> expect<00:02:20.750> track<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> be<00:02:22.370> one<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you would expect track a to be one and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.780 
you would expect track a to be one and
so<00:02:23.330> forth<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:24.290> let's<00:02:24.740> go<00:02:24.860> ahead<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.130> play<00:02:27.790> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
so forth but let's go ahead and play so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.020 
so forth but let's go ahead and play so
it<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.180> off<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.780> bat<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.170> works<00:02:30.580> always<00:02:31.580> good

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
it just off the bat it works always good

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.400 
it just off the bat it works always good
thing<00:02:33.910> something<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.390> mention<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:35.990> that<00:02:36.140> it's

Blake<00:03:58.040> Hughes<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.090> is<00:03:59.150> basically<00:03:59.690> what<00:03:59.870> you

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
Blake Hughes this is basically what you

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.449 
Blake Hughes this is basically what you
would<00:04:00.080> expect<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.680> regular<00:04:00.980> mixer<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:01.400> I'm

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
would expect on a regular mixer so I'm

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.199 
would expect on a regular mixer so I'm
not<00:04:01.640> gonna<00:04:01.790> cover<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.950> it's<00:04:04.730> basic

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
not gonna cover that so it's basic

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.580 
not gonna cover that so it's basic
things<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.420> can<00:04:05.569> expect<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.050> can<00:04:06.200> pretty

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
things you can expect you can pretty

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.160 
things you can expect you can pretty
much<00:04:06.680> do<00:04:06.920> everything<00:04:07.130> on<00:04:07.970> track<00:04:08.180> your<00:04:08.540> with

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
much do everything on track your with

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.430 
much do everything on track your with
the<00:04:09.290> been<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.739> NMC<00:04:11.200> something<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.319> you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the been on the NMC something that you

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.830 
the been on the NMC something that you
might<00:04:12.590> be<00:04:12.739> trying<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.280> figure<00:04:13.459> out<00:04:13.700> took<00:04:14.660> me<00:04:14.810> a

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
might be trying to figure out took me a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.539 
might be trying to figure out took me a
while<00:04:15.050> have<00:04:15.380> to<00:04:15.500> actually<00:04:15.800> read<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.100> manual

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
while have to actually read the manual

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.819 
while have to actually read the manual
it's<00:04:16.760> actually<00:04:17.419> with<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.320> knob<00:04:18.530> right<00:04:18.769> here

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
it's actually with the knob right here

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.280 
it's actually with the knob right here
you<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.310> scroll<00:04:19.549> through<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.910> tracks<00:04:20.209> but<00:04:21.169> if

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
you can scroll through the tracks but if

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.830 
you can scroll through the tracks but if
you<00:04:21.380> want<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.709> go<00:04:21.859> ahead<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.400> scroll<00:04:22.940> on<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
you want to go ahead and scroll on the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.560 
you want to go ahead and scroll on the
actual<00:04:24.200> library<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:25.729> have<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:26.000> shift<00:04:27.160> if<00:04:28.570> that

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
actual library you have to shift if that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.600 
actual library you have to shift if that
really<00:04:29.750> do<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.050> one<00:04:30.290> half<00:04:30.500> if<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.680> shift<00:04:31.100> and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
really do this one half if you shift and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.629

the expected here you reflect parameters

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.330 
the expected here you reflect parameters
they<00:05:02.960> were<00:05:03.110> just<00:05:03.410> like<00:05:03.560> factor<00:05:03.949> so<00:05:04.100> right<00:05:04.250> now

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
they were just like factor so right now

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.310 
they were just like factor so right now
we're<00:05:04.460> going<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.639> activate<00:05:04.820> effect<00:05:05.270> 1<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:06.199> the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320

left X we have turntables great so very
simple<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:11.600> works<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:14.180> we<00:05:14.630> got<00:05:14.780> back<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:17.410> on

this<00:05:18.620> second<00:05:19.130> defect<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:20.060> mean<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.389> have<00:05:20.650> let's

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
this second defect I mean we have let's

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.560 
this second defect I mean we have let's
play<00:05:21.919> with<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.190> effects<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.610> little<00:05:22.910> so<00:05:23.120> what

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
play with the effects a little so what

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.730 
play with the effects a little so what
slow<00:05:23.810> effect<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.850> focus<00:05:25.850> again<00:05:26.530> right<00:05:27.530> here

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
slow effect to focus again right here

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.879 
slow effect to focus again right here
you<00:05:27.889> would<00:05:28.010> activate<00:05:28.490> defect

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:06:20.620 

I<00:05:37.550> surveyed

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.200 

so<00:06:21.630> it's<00:06:21.780> basically<00:06:22.610> what<00:06:23.610> you<00:06:23.760> would<00:06:23.850> expect

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
so it's basically what you would expect

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.960 
so it's basically what you would expect
really<00:06:25.050> from<00:06:25.350> a<00:06:25.680> controller<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:26.580> just<00:06:26.760> works

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
really from a controller it just works

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.820 
really from a controller it just works
it<00:06:27.240> works<00:06:27.390> a<00:06:27.540> tractor<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.140> works<00:06:28.320> for<00:06:28.500> Virtual

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
it works a tractor it works for Virtual

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.870 
it works a tractor it works for Virtual

music it's just a blast it's loud even
at<00:06:43.980> low<00:06:44.160> volumes<00:06:44.960> you<00:06:45.960> can<00:06:46.110> feel<00:06:54.530> you<00:06:55.530> can<00:06:55.710> kind

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
at low volumes you can feel you can kind

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.200 
at low volumes you can feel you can kind
of<00:06:55.980> see<00:06:56.130> that<00:06:56.250> it<00:06:56.370> has<00:06:56.490> some<00:06:56.520> power<00:06:56.880> you<00:06:57.090> can

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
of see that it has some power you can

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.600 
of see that it has some power you can
tell<00:06:57.390> it's<00:06:57.600> really<00:06:57.660> a<00:06:58.380> well<00:06:58.890> built<00:06:59.220> great

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
tell it's really a well built great

sound<00:06:59.910> card<00:07:00.210> it's<00:07:00.630> also<00:07:01.040> very<00:07:02.040> heavy<00:07:02.900> well<00:07:03.900> it

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
sound card it's also very heavy well it

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.630 
sound card it's also very heavy well it
actually<00:07:04.140> stinks<00:07:04.890> so<00:07:05.010> let<00:07:05.130> me<00:07:05.220> see<00:07:05.340> if<00:07:05.370> I<00:07:05.520> can

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
actually stinks so let me see if I can

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.670 
actually stinks so let me see if I can
lift<00:07:05.790> in<00:07:06.000> here<00:07:07.190> it<00:07:08.190> actually<00:07:08.520> sticks<00:07:08.910> to<00:07:09.240> the

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
lift in here it actually sticks to the

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.590 
lift in here it actually sticks to the
actual<00:07:10.680> table<00:07:11.040> but<00:07:11.430> it's<00:07:11.820> pretty<00:07:12.120> heavy<00:07:12.300> very

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 
actual table but it's pretty heavy very

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.660 
actual table but it's pretty heavy very
solid<00:07:13.050> it's<00:07:13.140> actually<00:07:13.470> way<00:07:13.710> heavier<00:07:14.100> than<00:07:14.160> the

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:14.670 
solid it's actually way heavier than the

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.420 
solid it's actually way heavier than the
zone<00:07:14.880> DX<00:07:15.150> because<00:07:15.930> it's<00:07:16.080> a<00:07:16.170> portable<00:07:16.470> unit<00:07:16.980> you

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
zone DX because it's a portable unit you

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.190 
zone DX because it's a portable unit you
don't<00:07:17.460> want<00:07:17.730> something<00:07:17.910> that<00:07:18.240> heavy<00:07:18.510> but<00:07:18.870> I<00:07:18.900> I

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
don't want something that heavy but I I

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.900 
don't want something that heavy but I I
feel<00:07:19.560> it<00:07:19.680> strikes<00:07:19.980> a<00:07:20.100> balance<00:07:20.310> I<00:07:20.610> mean<00:07:20.640> it's

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:20.910 
feel it strikes a balance I mean it's

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.900 
feel it strikes a balance I mean it's
heavy<00:07:21.240> to<00:07:21.420> the<00:07:21.450> point<00:07:21.780> where<00:07:22.430> it<00:07:23.430> feels<00:07:23.460> really

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
heavy to the point where it feels really

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.940 
heavy to the point where it feels really
solid<00:07:24.240> but<00:07:24.570> it's<00:07:24.690> not<00:07:24.870> that<00:07:25.470> heavy<00:07:25.680> where

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950 
solid but it's not that heavy where

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.960 
solid but it's not that heavy where
you're<00:07:26.070> like<00:07:26.220> okay<00:07:26.460> I<00:07:26.490> don't<00:07:26.550> want<00:07:26.790> to<00:07:26.850> take

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
you're like okay I don't want to take

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.730 
you're like okay I don't want to take
this<00:07:27.090> with<00:07:27.240> me<00:07:27.300> all<00:07:27.510> the<00:07:27.600> time<00:07:27.660> so<00:07:28.380> this<00:07:28.560> is

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
this with me all the time so this is
