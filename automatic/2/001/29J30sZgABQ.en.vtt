your<00:00:23.789> rickrack<00:00:24.210> machine<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.350> when<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.619> first

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
your rickrack machine so when they first

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.269 
your rickrack machine so when they first
arrive<00:00:26.300> they<00:00:27.300> come<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> connectors

board and give it a parent nice yeah and
you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.260> they've<00:00:52.530> got<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:53.219> nice<00:00:53.520> square

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you can see they've got a nice square

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.689 
you can see they've got a nice square
connector<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> end<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.309> legs

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
right and the player has brought

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.080 
right and the player has brought
everything<00:00:58.649> so<00:01:01.100> if<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.309> using<00:01:02.489> something

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
everything so if you're using something

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.740 
everything so if you're using something
else<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.600> an<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> St<00:01:05.880> gig<00:01:06.119> 3<00:01:06.479> which

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
else like an this is the St gig 3 which

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
else like an this is the St gig 3 which
is<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> sport<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.460> got<00:01:08.610> screw<00:01:08.970> tails

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
is a sport now this has got screw tails

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.140 
is a sport now this has got screw tails
so<00:01:09.979> for<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> print<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.369> I'm<00:01:11.520> using<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.970> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so for the print of it I'm using this on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.719 
so for the print of it I'm using this on
I'll<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> test<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.979> sort<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> general<00:01:14.549> all

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I'll have to test on sort of general all

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
I'll have to test on sort of general all
instead<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> connector<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.530> we're

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
instead of a connector that's what we're

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
instead of a connector that's what we're
aiming<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:18.000> rid<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
aiming to do here to get rid of all of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.300 
aiming to do here to get rid of all of
these<00:01:19.200> cables<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> don't<00:01:20.430> need<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
these cables that you don't need and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
these cables that you don't need and
basically<00:01:23.310> clean<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.900> large<00:01:25.140> can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
basically clean it up so this large can

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.890 
basically clean it up so this large can
it<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.650> got<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.180> off<00:01:27.180> switch<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it just got the off switch with the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
it just got the off switch with the
controller<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> green<00:01:29.670> wire

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
controller and that's the green wire

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.660 
controller and that's the green wire
same<00:01:30.810> here

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
same here

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.830 
same here
so<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:32.930> need<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.229> save<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.590> green<00:01:33.800> water<00:01:34.100> and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
so we need to save the green water and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.330 
so we need to save the green water and
the<00:01:35.840> way<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.020> turn<00:01:36.290> these<00:01:36.470> pacifies<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.190> is

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
the way you turn these pacifies on is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.040 
the way you turn these pacifies on is
you<00:01:37.460> connect<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.940> green<00:01:38.120> wire<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.570> any<00:01:38.840> black

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
you connect the green wire to any black

00:01:39.050 --> 00:02:00.399 
you connect the green wire to any black
boy<00:01:58.150> looking<00:01:59.150> at<00:01:59.330> solar<00:01:59.570> here<00:01:59.869> we<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:00.200> see

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
boy looking at solar here we can see

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.340 
boy looking at solar here we can see
this<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.920> green<00:02:01.130> water<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.520> want<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.790> save

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
this the green water I want to save

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.870 
this the green water I want to save
we're<00:02:03.350> gonna<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:03.740> massive<00:02:04.190> code<00:02:04.700> was

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
we're gonna think massive code was

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.510 
we're gonna think massive code was
coming<00:02:05.240> in<00:02:05.300> here<00:02:05.570> you<00:02:05.920> know<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.039> only<00:02:07.130> one<00:02:07.310> I'm

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
coming in here you know the only one I'm

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.650 
coming in here you know the only one I'm
interested<00:02:07.729> in<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:09.080> yellow<00:02:09.320> one<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
interested in the yellow one and the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.509 
interested in the yellow one and the
black<00:02:11.870> ones<00:02:12.080> which<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> negative<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
black ones which at the negative the

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.780 
black ones which at the negative the
other<00:02:13.550> cables<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:15.100> there's<00:02:16.100> an<00:02:16.310> orange<00:02:16.580> one

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
other cables here there's an orange one

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.990 
other cables here there's an orange one
which<00:02:17.060> i<00:02:17.209> think<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.920> 3<00:02:18.920> volts<00:02:19.280> or<00:02:19.430> something

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
which i think is 3 volts or something

which i think is 3 volts or something
red<00:02:20.630> ones<00:02:20.870> which<00:02:21.050> are<00:02:21.230> 5<00:02:21.410> volts<00:02:21.890> none<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.790> them

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
red ones which are 5 volts none of them

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
red ones which are 5 volts none of them
are<00:02:23.150> interested<00:02:23.660> oh<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.769> they're<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.070> gonna

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
large conductor can you do now add a bit

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.130 
large conductor can you do now add a bit
of<00:02:40.340> South<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.910> black<00:02:41.239> boy<00:02:41.480> because<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.959> need

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
of South one black boy because I need

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.810 
of South one black boy because I need
one<00:02:42.170> black<00:02:42.620> wire<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:43.040> switch<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.489> thing<00:02:43.670> on

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
one black wire to switch the thing on
let's<00:02:44.510> drill<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.840> bit

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
let's drill a bit

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.350 
let's drill a bit
twist<00:02:47.709> them<00:02:47.920> together<00:02:48.099> they<00:02:48.819> could<00:02:49.060> solve

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
twist them together they could solve

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.110 
twist them together they could solve
these<00:02:50.250> problems<00:02:51.250> together<00:02:51.400> or<00:02:51.760> whatever<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
these problems together or whatever you

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120 
these problems together or whatever you
like<00:02:52.239> I'm<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.500> use<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.980> these

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
like I'm just going to use one of these

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.479 
like I'm just going to use one of these
little<00:02:55.500> strips<00:02:58.709> ok<00:02:59.709> so<00:02:59.950> they<00:03:00.160> connect

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
little strips ok so they connect

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.000 
little strips ok so they connect
together<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.270> will<00:03:01.510> tuck<00:03:01.720> them<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.770> do

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
together and then I will tuck them to do

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.400 
together and then I will tuck them to do
the<00:03:03.250> based<00:03:03.580> on<00:03:03.730> medium<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.420> my<00:03:05.050> son<00:03:05.260> we

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the based on medium and for my son we

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.410 
the based on medium and for my son we
gonna<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.220> travel<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:06.760> right<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.269> what
