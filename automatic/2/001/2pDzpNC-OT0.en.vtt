00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
we're going to find out the free I mean

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320 
we're going to find out the free I mean
the<00:00:10.080> full<00:00:10.320> length<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> bike<00:00:11.190> were<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
the full length of the bike were the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.820 
the full length of the bike were the
full<00:00:12.599> extension<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:14.360> on<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.650> right-side<00:00:16.650> up

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830

like this one maybe from the seal to the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
like this one maybe from the seal to the
top<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> trees<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.760> mean<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> bottom<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
top of the trees I mean to the bottom of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
top of the trees I mean to the bottom of
the<00:00:31.260> bottom<00:00:31.590> tree<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:32.130> means<00:00:32.160> ski<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the bottom tree which means ski right in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.319 
the bottom tree which means ski right in
here<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> seal

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
here so we're going to go from the seal

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.590 
here so we're going to go from the seal
from<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> point<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> top<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> seal

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
from this point from the top of the seal

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.319 
from this point from the top of the seal
right<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:43.100> with<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> bike<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> wheel

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
right here with the bike with the wheel

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.010 
right here with the bike with the wheel
off<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> ground<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.899> going

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
off the ground in the back we're going

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.049 
off the ground in the back we're going
to<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> same<00:00:49.530> thing<00:00:49.829> except<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> bag

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to do the same thing except in the bag

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.549 
to do the same thing except in the bag
the<00:00:51.690> roll<00:00:51.870> variation<00:00:52.940> I'm<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.239> from

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
the roll variation I'm gonna go from

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
the roll variation I'm gonna go from
from<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> axle<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.870> an

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
from the axle and this is just an

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
from the axle and this is just an
arbitrary<00:00:58.410> point<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.980> pick<00:00:59.160> whichever

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
arbitrary point you can pick whichever

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.049 
arbitrary point you can pick whichever
points<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:01.219> there<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
points you want there is that if you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
points you want there is that if you
would<00:01:03.210> say<00:01:03.449> measure<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:04.860> have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
would say measure it you would have

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.730 
would say measure it you would have
taken<00:01:05.129> even<00:01:05.519> number<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.939> 30<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.659> 30<00:01:07.380> or

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
taken even number like 30 to 30 or

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
taken even number like 30 to 30 or
whatever<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.939> you're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.420> pick<00:01:09.630> some

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
whatever you know you're gonna pick some

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.190 
whatever you know you're gonna pick some
oddball<00:01:10.080> number<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.299> 31<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.630> five-eighths

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
oddball number like 31 and five-eighths

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.080 
oddball number like 31 and five-eighths
because<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.250> gonna<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.939> inch

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because you're gonna have they can inch

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.450 
because you're gonna have they can inch
and<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> quarter<00:01:15.479> away<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.259> number<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and a quarter away from that number so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
and a quarter away from that number so
if<00:01:17.610> you're<00:01:17.759> dealing<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.210> even<00:01:18.479> numbers<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
if you're dealing with even numbers it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:37.100 
if you're dealing with even numbers it
makes<00:01:19.560> life<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.130> much<00:01:20.189> easier

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
hit the front brake you let the bike

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.930 
hit the front brake you let the bike
settle<00:03:49.210> down<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.170> would<00:03:50.290> put<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:50.940> as

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
settle down and you would put as much as

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.210 
settle down and you would put as much as
possible<00:03:52.380> on<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.930> toes<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.740> want<00:03:57.040> all

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
possible on the toes so you want all

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.880 
possible on the toes so you want all
your<00:03:57.550> weight<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:57.910> bunch<00:03:58.660> as<00:03:58.780> possible<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
your weight on the bunch as possible and

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.240 
your weight on the bunch as possible and
then<00:04:00.070> I'm<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.670> measure<00:04:05.040> one<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.160> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
then I'm going to measure one in the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.210 
then I'm going to measure one in the
