00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 underneath, I will not show a 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.269
 person in this video of today that after 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 a certain time the person is not dignified 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.219
 and I had a bad time today I did not 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.450
 I'm very presentable and what? 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.219
 It really matters you see the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.239
 ingredients and the whole process that goes 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.489
 look very nice 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.640
 tomorrow there will probably be a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.500
 new video is about the cup that later 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.120
 We'll talk more about it then. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.940
 Come on, it does not seem to hurt us. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 You'll need a can of milk. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.120
 condensed 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:12.479
 We will also use a can of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:15.390
 lemon juice lemon juice we go 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.549
 hit a few minutes to lie in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.259
 two minutes is the milk 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.369
 condensed with this cream is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.720
 at maximum power 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.330
 now after I hit the cream of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 milk and condensed milk by following 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.470
 about two minutes a little 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670
 to add that amount here today 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.770
 lemon juice 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.659
 It's not a glass full of people. 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.280
 It's a glass, two to three fingers. 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.229
 it's an american cup 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.750
 and I'll put it there, I'll leave one 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 dregs why I'm going to hit now 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 and I'm going to measure to see if it will be too long. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.390
 I'm very fond of the yes because sometimes 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.790
 There's a brother who stays more ezedin. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.710
 determined that not so much 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.490
 So we'll do this test then. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.490
 now I'm going to hit 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.560
 Good, I tried. I'll put the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:17.349
 the animal's coffin just a little bit 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 but above all here but only then 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.020
 girls for the second part of our 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 girl 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.110
 we will use the following ingredients 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:31.450
 It's three eggs that we're going to be 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.950
 clear and yolk is chocolate is bitter and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.099
 milk chocolate 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 I used a half bar of chocolate 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.239
 bitter or half bitter pardon and 6 bar 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 of milk chocolate and we also 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.880
 will use is a spoonful of sugar and a 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.880
 can of sour cream 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.190
 the first thing we'll do is 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.200
 start hitting the gem is over 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.200
 first we'll make people 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.569
 will sift the yolk to get out that 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.489
 I like egg knows not to be with 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.400
 I like to hear the ad after the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.400
 people see in the gems and we will put 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.620
 And here we go. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 tap very slowly until it is folded 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.100
 more or less size 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.430
 we'll add a 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.430
 tablespoon sugar and continue beating're 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.250
 We'll add the chocolate later. 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.380
 melted chocolate people work 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.329
 the following way you will put the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.579
 chocolate is slowly 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.620
 and there you will melt in the microwave is 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.930
 super quickly you will melt the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.810
 The following way you will put your 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.989
 micro-waves at an average power in my 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.389
 micro waves at power 8 in case e there 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.489
 you are putting 30 seconds 20 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.829
 seconds, forty seconds until I go 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.530
 they were stirring chocolate or 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.230
 stirring until the chocolate melts 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.250
 Should I put it once for 40 seconds 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.750
 once every 31 instead of 20 to finalize and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.750
 gave it right 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.609
 before putting it into the mixer should 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.880
 put another 10 seconds to 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.000
 stay well, but people do not put 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.979
 is the chocolate to melt microwaves if 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.320
 the power has something to watch 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.430
 in power because if you put it is a 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.370
 very power 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.560
 the microwave a very high power is the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.900
 whip will burn it will melt're 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.430
 so this is very important and after that 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.830
 We put the chocolate people go 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.870
 put a can of sour cream 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.600
 after everything is homogeneous 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.030
 batidinho then we go there will put 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.860
 in the open, just put things first 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.850
 We'll beat them in the snow and then 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.100
 will incorporate these clearings into music 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.500
 in the museum in the music do not know 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.599
 And then I'll show you guys, then. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.500
 I already penner mg but now I'm going to add 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.500
 she is in the mixer 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.760
 now I'll put my face to hit a 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.050
 the screen more or less 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.240
 volume and then I'll show it to you now 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.720
 I was knocking a little, I'm going to add 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.910
 the sugar 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.880
 now I'll add the chocolate, ok? 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.500
 here and I'm going to hit everything everything on the hour 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.580
 that being homogeneous will add the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:32.210
 then we are the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.640
 chocolate yummy chocolate mixture 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:39.500
 sugar and cream is just okay 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.900
 It is remembering that the cream you 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.150
 They will put then quickly after 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:48.440
 You put chocolate because otherwise 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.840
 chocolate it changes texture and starts to 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.990
 getting solid again is now going 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:06:00.050

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.730
 personal beats the bugle hesitates and now 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.900
 I'm going to incorporate it into chocolate 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.870
 Just mix it up and then I'll show you 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.120
