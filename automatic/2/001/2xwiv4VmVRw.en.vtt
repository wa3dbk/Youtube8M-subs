00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

such<00:00:00.359> a<00:00:00.390> passion<00:00:00.989> that<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.319> could<00:00:01.500> have<00:00:01.589> that's

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
such a passion that I could have that's

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.539 
such a passion that I could have that's
changed<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.909> horns<00:00:03.650> in<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:04.859> fashion<00:00:05.400> I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
changed to the horns in this fashion I

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.970 
changed to the horns in this fashion I
could<00:00:05.819> increase<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.870> weight<00:00:07.109> at<00:00:07.440> any<00:00:07.710> rate<00:00:07.950> I

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
could increase the weight at any rate I

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.370 
could increase the weight at any rate I
wanted<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.849> by<00:00:09.120> using<00:00:09.330> different<00:00:09.929> lengths<00:00:10.260> of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
wanted to by using different lengths of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.720 
wanted to by using different lengths of
chain<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.769> different<00:00:11.759> sizes<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.360> chain<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
chain and different sizes of chain I

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.760 
chain and different sizes of chain I
could<00:00:14.730> increase<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.480> weight<00:00:15.660> slowly<00:00:16.410> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
could increase the weight slowly a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.529 
could increase the weight slowly a
rapidly<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.699> great<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> small<00:00:19.109> amount

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
rapidly a great video or a small amount

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.090 
rapidly a great video or a small amount
but<00:00:21.539> having<00:00:21.930> increased<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> couldn't

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
but having increased it I couldn't

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.759 
but having increased it I couldn't
decrease<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.930> stay<00:00:25.199> with<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
decrease it I had to stay with the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.880 
decrease it I had to stay with the
maximum<00:00:26.460> level<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.090> reached<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.680> had

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
maximum level that I reached so that had

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.740 
maximum level that I reached so that had
some<00:00:29.160> applications<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.599> an

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
some applications and that was an

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.630 
some applications and that was an
improvement<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:31.949> no<00:00:32.130> great

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
improvement but it was no great

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.069 
improvement but it was no great
improvement<00:00:34.399> because<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.730> most<00:00:36.079> exercises

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
improvement because in most exercises

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.010 
improvement because in most exercises
your<00:00:37.290> strength<00:00:37.620> doesn't<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:39.809> may

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
your strength doesn't just go up it may

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.770 
your strength doesn't just go up it may
go<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> may<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.570> up

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
go down and then go up or it may go up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.440 
go down and then go up or it may go up
and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:47.000> over<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> years

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and then go back down over the years

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.450 
and then go back down over the years
I've<00:00:48.750> tried<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.020> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> things<00:00:50.600> in<00:00:52.010> 1958<00:00:53.010> time

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I've tried a lot of things in 1958 time

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
I've tried a lot of things in 1958 time
built<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> machine<00:00:55.370> without<00:00:56.370> really

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
built a machine without really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
built a machine without really
understanding<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:59.570> having<00:01:00.570> finished<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
understanding it having finished it I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
understanding it having finished it I
had<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> consider<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.059> better

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
had had what I consider to be a better

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.830 
had had what I consider to be a better
idea<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> machine<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.720> my

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
idea so I put the machine out in my

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
idea so I put the machine out in my
backyard<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> stood<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.520> arrested

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
backyard and it stood there and arrested

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.149 
backyard and it stood there and arrested
it<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> pile<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.930> junk<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.680> wasn't<00:01:10.920> ever

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it into a pile of junk and wasn't ever

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
it into a pile of junk and wasn't ever
used<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:13.310> had<00:01:14.310> solved<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> most<00:01:15.509> not<00:01:16.170> all<00:01:16.200> but

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
used I had solved and most not all but

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
used I had solved and most not all but
most<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> problems<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:20.540> providing<00:01:21.540> full

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
most of the problems of providing full

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.580 
most of the problems of providing full
brains<00:01:22.290> exercise<00:01:23.420> without<00:01:24.420> even<00:01:25.110> being<00:01:25.320> aware

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
brains exercise without even being aware

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
brains exercise without even being aware
of<00:01:25.799> all<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.460> problems<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.930> certainly

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
of all the problems and certainly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.679 
of all the problems and certainly
without<00:01:28.829> being<00:01:29.280> aware<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.909> had<00:01:30.090> solved

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
without being aware that I had solved

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.399 
without being aware that I had solved
them<00:01:32.060> but<00:01:33.060> by<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.960> built<00:01:34.259> this

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
them but by the time I built this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
them but by the time I built this
machine<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> considered<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
machine and had what I considered a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
machine and had what I considered a
better<00:01:37.049> idea<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.130> went<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.759> went<00:01:39.030> off

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
better idea so I went on off went off

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.649 
better idea so I went on off went off
then<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> tangent<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.500> another<00:01:40.860> approach

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
then on a tangent on another approach

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
then on a tangent on another approach
and<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> solution<00:01:43.619> set<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.040> my

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and there the solution set in my

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.510 
and there the solution set in my
backyard<00:01:44.600> rusting<00:01:45.600> into<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.930> pile<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> junk<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
backyard rusting into a pile of junk it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.569 
backyard rusting into a pile of junk it
was<00:01:47.640> never<00:01:47.880> used<00:01:48.950> later<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.399> evidence

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
was never used later when the evidence

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.020 
was never used later when the evidence
would<00:01:51.119> point<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> had<00:01:52.320> been<00:01:53.030> my

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
would point back to where I had been my

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
would point back to where I had been my
tendency<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.229> oh<00:01:55.259> no<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.950> wrong<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tendency was to say oh no that's wrong I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.649 
tendency was to say oh no that's wrong I
tried<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.869> doesn't<00:01:58.350> work<00:01:59.119> well<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> hadn't

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
tried that it doesn't work well I hadn't

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.380 
tried that it doesn't work well I hadn't
tried<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.140> myself<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> had<00:02:02.430> tried

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.809 

ten<00:02:06.390> years<00:02:06.659> later<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.110> 1968<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.429> living<00:02:08.729> in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
ten years later in 1968 I was living in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.780 
ten years later in 1968 I was living in
Africa<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:11.450> had<00:02:12.450> built<00:02:12.660> an<00:02:12.840> exercise<00:02:13.379> machine

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
Africa I had built an exercise machine

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.759 
Africa I had built an exercise machine
maybe<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.090> two<00:02:15.330> hundredth<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.560> that

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
maybe the two hundredth one at that

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.130 
maybe the two hundredth one at that
point<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.400> don't<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.480> how<00:02:18.720> many<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.959> an

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
point I don't really know how many in an

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
point I don't really know how many in an
attempt<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> solve<00:02:22.950> these<00:02:23.250> problems<00:02:23.849> was

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
attempt to solve these problems was

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.309 
attempt to solve these problems was
using<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> middle<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.110> ninth

using it in the middle of the ninth

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.190 
using it in the middle of the ninth
about<00:02:28.709> 2:15<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.519> suddenly<00:02:29.940> had<00:02:30.299> an<00:02:30.420> idea<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
about 2:15 I suddenly had an idea so I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.309 
about 2:15 I suddenly had an idea so I
called<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.860> my<00:02:32.099> associates<00:02:32.900> at<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.080> time

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
called one of my associates at that time

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.500 
called one of my associates at that time
the<00:02:34.500> morning<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> phone<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:38.239> took<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> pencil

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the morning on the phone I took a pencil

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.570 
the morning on the phone I took a pencil
and<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> piece<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.319> paper<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:40.920> had<00:02:41.099> him<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.549> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and a piece of paper and I had him get a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.979 
and a piece of paper and I had him get a
pencil<00:02:41.849> on<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> piece<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.390> paper

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
pencil on a piece of paper

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.680 
pencil on a piece of paper
I<00:02:43.190> told<00:02:44.190> him<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.519> take<00:02:44.700> his<00:02:44.910> pencil<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.540> go<00:02:45.630> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I told him to take his pencil and go to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.720 
I told him to take his pencil and go to
the<00:02:45.900> upper<00:02:46.200> left-hand<00:02:46.769> corner<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> sheet

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
the upper left-hand corner of the sheet

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.240 
the upper left-hand corner of the sheet
I'll<00:02:48.269> go<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.630> right<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.349> far<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.950> come

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
I'll go to the right so far now come

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.530 
I'll go to the right so far now come
down<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:51.209> had<00:02:51.390> him<00:02:51.569> draw<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.290> piece<00:02:52.709> apart

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
down and I had him draw that piece apart

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.069 
down and I had him draw that piece apart
over<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.780> phone<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.290> drew<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:56.480> took<00:02:57.480> about<00:02:57.720> 30

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
over the phone I drew it took about 30

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.050 
over the phone I drew it took about 30
minutes<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.530> describe<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.340> him<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.640> said<00:02:59.849> now

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
minutes to describe it to him I said now

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.460 
minutes to describe it to him I said now
build<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.599> and<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:00.959> here<00:03:01.230> at<00:03:01.349> 8<00:03:01.440> o'clock

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
build it and have it here at 8 o'clock

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.930 
build it and have it here at 8 o'clock
in<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.950> morning<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:03.390> he<00:03:03.510> did<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:05.640> put<00:03:05.849> it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
in the morning and he did and we put it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.629 
in the morning and he did and we put it
on<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.209> machine<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.470> didn't<00:03:07.739> work<00:03:07.890> then

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
on the machine and it didn't work then

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.920 
on the machine and it didn't work then
work<00:03:08.819> at<00:03:08.970> all<00:03:09.090> they<00:03:09.930> failed<00:03:11.269> but<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.329> failed<00:03:12.690> in

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
work at all they failed but it failed in

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.110 
work at all they failed but it failed in
such<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> dramatic<00:03:13.590> manner<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
such a dramatic manner that for the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.569 
such a dramatic manner that for the
first<00:03:15.359> time<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.900> understood<00:03:16.470> wine<00:03:16.889> failed<00:03:19.579> and

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
first time I understood wine failed and

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.000 
first time I understood wine failed and
I<00:03:20.850> also<00:03:21.060> understood<00:03:21.750> what<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.350> make<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.980> not

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
I also understood what is to make it not

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.680 
I also understood what is to make it not
fail<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.980> for<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> first<00:03:26.489> time<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.910> really

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
fail so for the first time I really

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.800 
fail so for the first time I really
understood<00:03:29.630> what<00:03:30.630> was<00:03:30.870> required<00:03:32.600> now<00:03:33.600> left

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
understood what was required now left

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.539 
understood what was required now left
Africa<00:03:34.290> shortly<00:03:34.709> after<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.100> we<00:03:35.190> came<00:03:35.340> back

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
Africa shortly after that we came back

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.190 
Africa shortly after that we came back
to<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.850> country<00:03:35.910> without<00:03:36.480> having<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:37.139> chance

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
to this country without having a chance

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.670 
to this country without having a chance
to<00:03:37.709> redesign<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:39.120> entire<00:03:39.239> machine<00:03:39.840> because

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
to redesign the entire machine because

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.620 
to redesign the entire machine because
it<00:03:40.920> wasn't<00:03:41.310> merely<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.639> matter<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.030> adding<00:03:42.269> a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
it wasn't merely a matter of adding a

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.840 
it wasn't merely a matter of adding a
part<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.139> my<00:03:43.319> existing<00:03:43.829> machine<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.310> had

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
part to my existing machine I had

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.060 
part to my existing machine I had
but<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.660> then<00:03:45.930> do<00:03:46.110> what<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.650> basically<00:03:49.070> in

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
but I then do what to do basically in

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.230 
but I then do what to do basically in
this<00:03:50.190> country<00:03:52.040> almost<00:03:53.040> immediately<00:03:53.730> started

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
this country almost immediately started

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.820 
this country almost immediately started
building<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.720> new<00:03:54.870> machine<00:03:59.840> step<00:04:00.840> by<00:04:01.140> step<00:04:01.470> once

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
building a new machine step by step once

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.510 
building a new machine step by step once
I<00:04:02.040> realized<00:04:03.350> really<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:05.010> first<00:04:05.250> time<00:04:05.490> I

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
I realized really the first time I

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.120 
I realized really the first time I
really<00:04:05.910> understood<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.540> problems<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:08.040> I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
really understood the problems so I

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.330 
really understood the problems so I
could<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.400> broke<00:04:08.610> them<00:04:08.790> alive<00:04:09.030> deeply<00:04:10.340> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
could have broke them alive deeply and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.850 
could have broke them alive deeply and
we<00:04:11.490> did<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:14.130> use<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.640> cam<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:16.290> vary<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
we did the use of a cam to vary the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.130 
we did the use of a cam to vary the
resistance<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.640> exercise<00:04:18.180> was<00:04:18.630> actually

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
resistance and exercise was actually

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.780 
resistance and exercise was actually
suggested<00:04:19.380> by<00:04:20.010> my<00:04:20.220> son<00:04:20.640> Gary<00:04:22.610> there<00:04:23.610> are<00:04:23.670> any

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
suggested by my son Gary there are any

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.310 
suggested by my son Gary there are any
number<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.240> ways<00:04:24.420> you<00:04:24.480> can<00:04:24.870> vary<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
number of ways you can vary the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.700 
number of ways you can vary the
resistance<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:26.040> an<00:04:26.160> exercise<00:04:27.140> cam<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.350> not<00:04:28.560> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
resistance in an exercise cam is not the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.710 
resistance in an exercise cam is not the
only<00:04:28.890> way<00:04:29.250> although<00:04:29.550> it's<00:04:29.820> by<00:04:30.030> far<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.300> best

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
only way although it's by far the best

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.280 
only way although it's by far the best
way<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.200> really<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.650> only<00:04:31.680> practical<00:04:32.430> way

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.400 

but<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.320> had<00:04:37.650> not<00:04:37.830> thought<00:04:37.890> of<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.400> cam<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:39.410> was

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
but I had not thought of the cam I was

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.350 
but I had not thought of the cam I was
discussing<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:41.160> number<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.580> other<00:04:41.730> ways<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
discussing a number of other ways and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.020 
discussing a number of other ways and
making<00:04:42.720> sketches<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.650> drew<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.280> gearbox

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
making sketches and I drew the gearbox

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.260 
making sketches and I drew the gearbox
as<00:04:45.390> viewed<00:04:45.750> from<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:46.110> side<00:04:46.790> but<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:47.850> didn't

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
as viewed from the side but I didn't

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.290 
as viewed from the side but I didn't
tell<00:04:48.450> my<00:04:48.780> son<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.230> was<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.410> gearbox<00:04:50.180> and<00:04:51.180> I

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
tell my son that was a gearbox and I

as<00:05:15.270> he<00:05:15.510> said<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.900> course<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.260> realized<00:05:16.650> he

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
as he said it of course I realized he

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.860 
as he said it of course I realized he
was<00:05:16.950> right<00:05:17.160> so<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.060> set<00:05:18.330> up<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.630> night

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
was right so I set up that night

was right so I set up that night
designing<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:20.340> first<00:05:20.520> cam<00:05:21.890> having<00:05:22.890> designed

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
designing the first cam having designed

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.640 
designing the first cam having designed
it<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.940> range<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.390> movement<00:05:24.600> required<00:05:25.290> the

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
it the range of movement required the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.130 
it the range of movement required the
shape<00:05:25.950> required<00:05:27.710> having<00:05:28.710> drawn<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:30.140> was

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
shape required having drawn it I was

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.050 
shape required having drawn it I was
immediately<00:05:31.410> struck<00:05:31.740> by<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.310> fact<00:05:32.640> that<00:05:32.850> it

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
immediately struck by the fact that it

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.790 
immediately struck by the fact that it
had<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> strong<00:05:33.470> resemblance<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.680> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
had a strong resemblance to the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.140 
had a strong resemblance to the
cross-section<00:05:35.520> of<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.700> nautilus<00:05:36.060> shell<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:39.030> it

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
cross-section of a nautilus shell and it

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.630 
cross-section of a nautilus shell and it
does<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.830> name<00:05:41.010> was<00:05:41.280> more<00:05:41.520> or<00:05:41.580> less

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
does so the name was more or less

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.530 
does so the name was more or less
unavoidable<00:05:42.590> in<00:05:43.590> any<00:05:43.740> case<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.340> next<00:05:45.150> morning
