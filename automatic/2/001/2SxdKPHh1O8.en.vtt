00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.260
 hello and welcome to this video which 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.950
 will talk about the night light bulbs of 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.290
 your car 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.389
 so actually actually on the job 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.840
 the original bulbs of your vehicle 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.970
 you have bulbs that are yellow 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.070
 most of the time and today I 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.919
 offers nightlights not yellow 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.320
 white and with them right now 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.040
 on your vehicle you have these 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.309
 bulbs 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.160
 they are original bulbs that are 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:38.170
 in the format on the night lights 80 90% of the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.840
 time they are nightlights w5 w it's 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.980
 what the w5 raise is the format of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.110
 lamps or just 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.820
 so actually this bulb to its limits 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.830
 of our killer after that may be for 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.210
 inside etc. only talked about 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.969
 May backgrounds 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.680
 the foreman put in here are some 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.989
 vehicles that do not wear the double 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.970
 for the night lights but 80% to 90% as 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.440
 I already said they will use this 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.390
 format me what I propose to you 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.860
 today are nightlights too 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.210
 but using 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.979
 so in fact it's not for the aisne 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.159
 it's with help I keep it at home 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.680
 so with the help of difference it's 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.180
 what already 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.710
 it will be LED that will illuminate 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.830
 your vehicle and not a swell op 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.830
 of origin more these seven east of the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.479
 it will illuminate in white what I 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.420
 I personally see it's white people 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.979
 pure pure white to see what it is 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.340
 on the internet you put on google 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.830
 images 6000 cases the letter figure 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.479
 k and you'll see what it's like 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.770
 we cry pure or anyway I 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.570
 give other images for you 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.920
 can see the difference 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.539
 So here is of origin cw sanded is what 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.950
 you will add it is also original 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.399
 it's more w -c of manufacturer origin 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.020
 wsa also indifference is by 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.190
 example here you can see there is a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 small width for 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 which is a bit wider than the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.160
 normal night light but do not worry 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.470
 it does not fit anyway it's no format 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.900
 who is like that and the construction of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.160
 this letter which is like that on the other hand 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.710
 it fits in your vehicle 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.560
 we can see at some brands 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.180
 some brands like mercedes who 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 make original white night lights 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.420
 that's it's original 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.280
 that's it if you want to insult them on 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.020
 your vehicle makes you add this march 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.490
 that's what I'm selling they've had 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.910
 bright spots so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.740
 that's after your nightmare confesses 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.540
 LED consumes more than 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.000
 so what will happen when 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 you're going to ask stolen if you have a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.040
 old vehicle does not want anything happen 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.270
 it's unfair to work and then that's it 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.710
 you have a vehicle a little more 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.590
 recent it will show you in the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.010
 dashboard 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.930
 you have to check your night light bulbs 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.550
 because are defective then 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.769
 that they are not defective could 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.260
 quickly to avoid this error message it 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.170
 must buy selena who are with in 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.970
 shooter therefore in fact links her to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.349
 resistances the last also to 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.690
 resistances because in fact she 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.549
 consume less than your original hen 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.920
 so here's to dash on the dashboard 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.440
 no I'm not embarrassed paul either 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.840
 yell there are resistances that are going 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.180
 to help you avoid this message 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.140
 error here after you also have some 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.000
 led like that the difference is that ben 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's not the same nerve already but it's 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.260
 the same if you forget you cnw is actually 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.349
 he does not know the same cheek because that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.879
 they do not have third teeth 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.400
 so that's the old vehicles 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.220
 it works it works bright 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.360
 will work it will work but there 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.170
 will not have any message of it again for 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.010
 old vehicles 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.540
 but for new vehicles 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.790
 absolutely buy that one there 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.920
 difference also this one there is 5 for 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.959
 the miners and that he has developed the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.690
 mine so here I thank you for 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.130
 have listened to me and then a next 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.700
 video and other videos for others 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.359
 explanations 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.359
 thanks goodbye
