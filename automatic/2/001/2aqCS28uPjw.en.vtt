have been lifting for 15 years or so so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
have been lifting for 15 years or so so
I<00:00:47.000> think<00:00:48.000> after<00:00:48.149> you've<00:00:48.450> been<00:00:48.629> doing<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.960> for

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
I think after you've been doing that for

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.889 
I think after you've been doing that for
15<00:00:49.500> years<00:00:49.770> you've<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> competed<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
15 years you've and I competed at a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.369 
15 years you've and I competed at a
fairly<00:00:52.289> high<00:00:52.440> level<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.280> you've<00:00:54.199> paid<00:00:55.199> your

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
fairly high level and you've paid your

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.139 
fairly high level and you've paid your
dues<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> speak<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:57.090> fair<00:00:57.899> enough<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
dues so to speak it's fair enough to

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.279 
dues so to speak it's fair enough to
take<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> little<00:01:00.390> break<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
take a little break and back off a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.599 
take a little break and back off a
little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> want

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
little bit and kind of do what you want

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.060 
little bit and kind of do what you want

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
she starts the lift she immediately
shifts<00:01:36.360> forward<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:36.960> her<00:01:37.079> knees<00:01:37.380> move

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
shifts forward you'll see her knees move

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
shifts forward you'll see her knees move
forward<00:01:38.040> her<00:01:38.130> weight<00:01:38.310> moved<00:01:38.579> forward<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.060> she

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
forward her weight moved forward and she

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
forward her weight moved forward and she
ends<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:40.320> only<00:01:42.170> having<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> bar<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.920> her

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
ends up not only having the bar and her

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.370 
ends up not only having the bar and her
center<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.759> mass<00:01:45.030> move<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> fall<00:01:45.840> forward<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
center of mass move to fall forward but

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
center of mass move to fall forward but
she<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> elevation<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> bar

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
she won't get the elevation on the bar

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.499 
she won't get the elevation on the bar
because<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> can't<00:01:48.780> push<00:01:49.259> straight<00:01:50.130> up

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
because you can't push straight up

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.819 
because you can't push straight up
against<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> ground<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.140> guess<00:01:52.409> technically

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
against the ground I guess technically

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.160 
against the ground I guess technically
it's<00:01:53.040> straight<00:01:53.340> down<00:01:53.579> but

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
it's straight down but

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.990 
it's straight down but
she'd<00:01:54.860> be<00:01:54.979> moving<00:01:55.100> herself<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.820> bar

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
she'd be moving herself in the bar

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.880 
she'd be moving herself in the bar
straight<00:01:56.299> up<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.900> we'll<00:01:57.020> see<00:01:57.229> how<00:01:57.470> she<00:01:57.530> does<00:01:57.740> on

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
straight up so we'll see how she does on

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.060 
straight up so we'll see how she does on
this<00:01:58.040> one<00:01:58.630> yeah<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:00.530> starting<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.920> happen

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
this one yeah so it's starting to happen

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.380

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
it's it's just a duel they kind of go

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.820 
it's it's just a duel they kind of go
back<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:10.940> forth<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.050> basically<00:02:12.590> push

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
back and forth and and basically push

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.420 
back and forth and and basically push
each<00:02:12.980> other<00:02:13.190> see<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:14.390> they<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.690> do<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.080> day

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
each other see what they can do that day

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.850 
each other see what they can do that day
although<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.819> don't<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.600> if<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.080> pushing<00:02:18.709> is

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
although I don't know if if pushing is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.680 
although I don't know if if pushing is
necessarily<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.850> best<00:02:20.000> word<00:02:20.269> since<00:02:20.569> they

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
necessarily the best word since they

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.150 
necessarily the best word since they
usually<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.260> weight<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.680> say<00:02:21.800> okay

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
usually get to a weight and say okay

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160 
usually get to a weight and say okay
that's<00:02:22.310> good<00:02:22.580> even<00:02:23.569> though<00:02:23.660> they<00:02:23.780> may<00:02:23.959> have

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that's good even though they may have

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.380 
that's good even though they may have
five<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.130> ten<00:02:25.280> more<00:02:25.430> kilos<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.060> them<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.269> they

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
five to ten more kilos in them if they

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.360 
five to ten more kilos in them if they
really<00:02:26.630> really<00:02:26.750> wanted<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.319> here's<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.250> better

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
really really wanted it here's a better

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.690 
really really wanted it here's a better
angle<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:28.850> her<00:02:29.060> her<00:02:29.660> knees<00:02:30.470> right<00:02:31.430> there

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
angle to see her her knees right there

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.370 
angle to see her her knees right there
yeah<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:33.230> second<00:02:33.860> she<00:02:33.950> goes<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.670> starts<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
yeah the second she goes and starts you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.530 
yeah the second she goes and starts you
know<00:02:36.500> initiates<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.250> upward<00:02:37.640> lift<00:02:37.940> those

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
know initiates that upward lift those

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.660 
know initiates that upward lift those
knees<00:02:38.569> shift<00:02:39.140> forward<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.650> her<00:02:40.130> whole<00:02:40.370> body

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
knees shift forward and her whole body

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.940 
knees shift forward and her whole body
slid<00:02:41.090> forward<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.380> see<00:02:42.500> care<00:02:42.769> they're

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
slid forward so you see care they're

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
slid forward so you see care they're
keeping<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.370> tension<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> whole<00:02:44.239> time

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
keeping that tension on the whole time

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.570 
keeping that tension on the whole time
so<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.870> bar<00:02:45.140> moves<00:02:45.560> kind<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.890> back<00:02:46.100> into<00:02:46.400> her

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
so that bar moves kind of back into her

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.340 
so that bar moves kind of back into her
hip<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.170> her<00:02:48.170> legs<00:02:48.380> can<00:02:48.650> drive<00:02:48.860> straight<00:02:49.250> down

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
hip and her legs can drive straight down

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.780 
hip and her legs can drive straight down
again<00:02:51.350> she's<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:51.950> banging<00:02:52.430> her<00:02:52.489> head<00:02:52.549> on

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
again she's just banging her head on

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.059 
again she's just banging her head on
this<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.170> I'm<00:02:54.170> probably<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> background

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
this one I'm probably in the background

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.640 
this one I'm probably in the background
yelling<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.610> her<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.880> keep<00:02:56.780> tight<00:02:57.049> about<00:02:57.170> how

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.460 
yelling at her to keep tight about how

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
consistency and precision has something

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.730 
consistency and precision has something
to<00:04:12.210> do<00:04:12.390> with<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.630> fact<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.990> she<00:04:13.260> was<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> level

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740

that proper balance and to you know

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.990

improve her confidence a lot of times

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.409

with<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.300> jerk<00:04:51.740> when<00:04:52.740> people<00:04:53.040> are<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.419> doing

with the jerk when people are not doing
a<00:04:54.540> good<00:04:55.020> dip<00:04:55.320> they're<00:04:55.590> sliding<00:04:55.980> forward<00:04:56.340> I

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
a good dip they're sliding forward I

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.790 
a good dip they're sliding forward I
think<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:56.940> more<00:04:57.600> an<00:04:57.840> issue<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.140> confidence

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
think it's more an issue of confidence

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.000 
think it's more an issue of confidence
than<00:04:59.040> of<00:04:59.160> anything<00:04:59.580> physical<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.480> that<00:05:01.380> kind

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
than of anything physical and that kind

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.730 
than of anything physical and that kind
of<00:05:02.040> knee<00:05:02.340> bend<00:05:02.640> only<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.900> vertical<00:05:04.230> trunk

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
of knee bend only the vertical trunk

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.580 
of knee bend only the vertical trunk
position<00:05:05.490> does<00:05:05.669> not<00:05:05.970> feel<00:05:06.360> strong<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.200> stable

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
position does not feel strong and stable

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.230 
position does not feel strong and stable
for<00:05:07.919> most<00:05:08.130> people<00:05:08.520> unless<00:05:08.790> they've<00:05:09.090> been

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
for most people unless they've been

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.570 
for most people unless they've been
doing<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.600> for<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.780> long<00:05:09.930> time<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:11.100> they<00:05:11.220> tend<00:05:11.460> to

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
doing it for a long time so they tend to

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.270 
doing it for a long time so they tend to
let<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.390> hips<00:05:12.570> go<00:05:13.020> back<00:05:13.200> first<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.950> think<00:05:14.130> this

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
let the hips go back first I think this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.590 
let the hips go back first I think this
was<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.490> first<00:05:14.700> day<00:05:14.850> Spencer<00:05:15.150> was<00:05:15.360> really

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
was the first day Spencer was really

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.480 
was the first day Spencer was really
gonna<00:05:15.810> snatch<00:05:16.200> bounces<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.890> his<00:05:17.010> life<00:05:17.220> so

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
gonna snatch bounces in his life so

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.870 
gonna snatch bounces in his life so
there<00:05:18.180> were<00:05:18.270> some<00:05:18.390> sketchy<00:05:18.660> ones<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.760> if

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
there were some sketchy ones and so if

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.550 
there were some sketchy ones and so if
you<00:05:20.970> can<00:05:21.090> get<00:05:21.210> that<00:05:21.419> dip<00:05:21.690> strong<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.410> get

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
you can get that dip strong you can get

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.969 
you can get that dip strong you can get
them<00:05:22.740> feeling<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:25.050> fact<00:05:25.320> that<00:05:25.410> if<00:05:25.560> they<00:05:25.710> can

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
them feeling the fact that if they can

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.260 
them feeling the fact that if they can
maintain<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.400> position<00:05:26.640> they<00:05:27.000> can't

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
maintain that position they can't

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.850 
maintain that position they can't
actually<00:05:27.479> get<00:05:27.870> enough<00:05:28.169> height<00:05:28.350> on<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.650> bar

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
actually get enough height on the bar

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.340 
actually get enough height on the bar
and<00:05:29.070> get<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.220> better<00:05:29.430> Drive<00:05:29.760> and<00:05:30.630> be<00:05:30.750> successful

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
and get a better Drive and be successful

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.690 
and get a better Drive and be successful
than<00:05:31.500> their<00:05:31.620> they're<00:05:32.010> more<00:05:32.190> inclined<00:05:32.550> to

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
than their they're more inclined to

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.750 
than their they're more inclined to
actually<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:33.360> when<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:33.540> counts<00:05:34.760> Cara's

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
actually do it when it counts Cara's

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.230 
actually do it when it counts Cara's
another<00:05:36.000> one<00:05:36.300> who<00:05:36.870> is<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.520> really<00:05:39.030> good

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
another one who is a a really good

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.690 
another one who is a a really good
jerker<00:05:39.780> she's<00:05:40.229> very<00:05:40.470> strong<00:05:40.860> in<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.160> jerk<00:05:41.400> but

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
jerker she's very strong in the jerk but

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.719 
jerker she's very strong in the jerk but
her<00:05:42.660> elbows<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:43.530> shoulders<00:05:43.560> really<00:05:44.430> limit

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
her elbows and shoulders really limit

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:45.500 
her elbows and shoulders really limit
her<00:05:44.820> top-end

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
her top-end

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.210 
her top-end
so<00:05:45.660> I<00:05:45.960> want<00:05:46.169> to<00:05:46.200> say<00:05:46.350> her<00:05:46.470> best<00:05:46.740> jerk<00:05:47.040> is

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
so I want to say her best jerk is

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.340 
so I want to say her best jerk is
somewhere<00:05:48.290> like<00:05:49.400> 105<00:05:50.400> 107<00:05:51.330> ish<00:05:51.690> somewhere

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
somewhere like 105 107 ish somewhere

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.070 
somewhere like 105 107 ish somewhere
around<00:05:52.440> there<00:05:53.390> maybe<00:05:54.390> you're<00:05:54.660> actually<00:05:54.900> a

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
around there maybe you're actually a

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.030 
around there maybe you're actually a
little<00:05:55.169> higher<00:05:55.440> than<00:05:55.650> that

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
little higher than that

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.650 
little higher than that
I<00:05:56.070> think<00:05:56.400> she's<00:05:56.550> cleaned<00:05:56.910> 110<00:05:57.780> or<00:05:58.560> 111<00:05:59.479> but<00:06:00.479> she

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
I think she's cleaned 110 or 111 but she

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.330 
I think she's cleaned 110 or 111 but she
