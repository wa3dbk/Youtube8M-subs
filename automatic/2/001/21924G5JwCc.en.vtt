00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
left these twists in for just five three

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.550 
left these twists in for just five three
weeks<00:00:25.670> if<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:26.360> had<00:00:26.510> left<00:00:26.690> them<00:00:26.779> in<00:00:26.869> tomorrow<00:00:27.140> it

would have been three weeks exactly so
that's<00:00:30.950> a<00:00:31.130> combination<00:00:31.369> of<00:00:32.060> I<00:00:32.360> think<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.689> did<00:00:32.900> a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
that's a combination of I think I did a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.560 
that's a combination of I think I did a
good<00:00:33.110> job<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.800> I'm<00:00:34.280> kind<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.670> lazy<00:00:34.880> because<00:00:35.300> I

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.340 
just look never feeling like taking them
out<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:39.700> because<00:00:40.700> i<00:00:40.730> have<00:00:41.150> where<00:00:41.360> I'm<00:00:41.570> like<00:00:41.990> up

was<00:00:46.760> up<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.680> i'm<00:00:49.400> having<00:00:49.640> swiss<00:00:49.910> out<00:00:50.090> for<00:00:50.360> a

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
was up so i'm having swiss out for a

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.390 
was up so i'm having swiss out for a
couple<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.660> days<00:00:50.810> until<00:00:51.110> i<00:00:51.320> go<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:52.040> my<00:00:52.070> deep

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
couple of days until i go to my deep

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.910 
couple of days until i go to my deep
condition<00:00:52.970> it's<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.930> first<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.320> month<00:00:54.470> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
condition it's the first of the month so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.510 
condition it's the first of the month so
as<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:55.820> know<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:56.330> time<00:00:56.570> for<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.900> and<00:00:57.520> I

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
as we know it's time for that and I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.920 
as we know it's time for that and I
guess<00:00:58.790> really<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.150> only<00:00:59.330> thing<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.840> I

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
guess really the only thing that I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.560 
guess really the only thing that I
wanted<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.290> say<00:01:00.650> about<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.820> whole<00:01:02.060> process

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
wanted to say about the whole process

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.969 
wanted to say about the whole process
puts<00:01:03.410> them<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.740> twist<00:01:04.040> out<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:05.200> that<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.740> whole

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
puts them to twist out is that the whole

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.370 
puts them to twist out is that the whole
sea<00:01:07.430> breeze<00:01:07.759> thing<00:01:08.240> works<00:01:08.780> really<00:01:09.229> really

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
sea breeze thing works really really

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.330 
sea breeze thing works really really
well<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:11.840> answer<00:01:11.869> my<00:01:12.409> question<00:01:12.890> that<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.130> had

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
well so to answer my question that I had

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.240 
well so to answer my question that I had
the<00:01:13.430> last<00:01:13.610> time<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.659> very<00:01:15.110> effective<00:01:15.860> I

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
the last time that is very effective I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.279 
the last time that is very effective I
got<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:18.229> sensitive<00:01:18.710> skin<00:01:18.950> time<00:01:20.200> because<00:01:21.200> I

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
got the sensitive skin time because I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.139 
got the sensitive skin time because I
didn't<00:01:21.499> want<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.740> be<00:01:21.859> super<00:01:22.189> alcohol<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.119> I

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
didn't want to be super alcohol and I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.109 
didn't want to be super alcohol and I
didn't<00:01:23.359> wanted<00:01:23.539> to<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> lot<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.049> of<00:01:24.259> smells

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
didn't wanted to have a lot of of smells

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.300 
didn't wanted to have a lot of of smells
so<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.630> mean<00:01:27.109> obviously<00:01:27.259> alcohol<00:01:28.039> is<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
so I mean obviously alcohol is the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
so I mean obviously alcohol is the
second<00:01:28.729> ingredient<00:01:29.420> because<00:01:29.689> I<00:01:30.170> mean<00:01:30.859> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
second ingredient because I mean I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.580 
second ingredient because I mean I
an<00:01:31.890> astringent<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:33.240> still<00:01:33.690> like<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.080> did<00:01:34.380> my

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
an astringent but still like I did my

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
an astringent but still like I did my
hair<00:01:34.830> never<00:01:34.980> felt<00:01:35.340> dry<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:36.000> actually<00:01:36.360> very

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hair never felt dry was actually very

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.430 
hair never felt dry was actually very
moist<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.230> I<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.620> it<00:01:37.710> still<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:39.440> my

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
moist and I think it still is and my

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.550 
moist and I think it still is and my
scalp<00:01:40.800> has<00:01:41.250> felt<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.940> clean<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:43.260> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
scalp has felt very clean I think the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
scalp has felt very clean I think the
worst<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.400> I've<00:01:44.580> been<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.270> far<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.600> like

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
worst that I've been as far as like

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.590 
worst that I've been as far as like
cleanliness<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.440> my<00:01:46.770> hair<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> scalp<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.940> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
cleanliness of my hair and scalp is the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.530 
cleanliness of my hair and scalp is the
hair<00:01:49.070> because<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.370> mess<00:01:50.580> around<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.300> like

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
hair because I mess around and put like

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.320 
hair because I mess around and put like
I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.490> glycerin<00:01:53.970> once<00:01:54.180> or

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
I think I did some glycerin once or

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.270 
I think I did some glycerin once or
twice<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.410> was<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.830> little<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.130> too

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
twice and that was just a little bit too

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.930 
twice and that was just a little bit too
greasy<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.120> was<00:01:57.240> heavy<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:59.220> think<00:01:59.760> one<00:01:59.910> day

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
greasy it was heavy and I think one day

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.750 
greasy it was heavy and I think one day
I<00:02:00.120> use<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.650> leave<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:01.980> conditioners<00:02:02.580> I

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
I use one of my leave in conditioners I

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.510 
I use one of my leave in conditioners I
think<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.030> used<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.360> austria's<00:02:04.340> leave<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
think I used to austria's leave in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.510 
think I used to austria's leave in
conditioner<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.650> it<00:02:07.650> just<00:02:07.890> made<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> little

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
conditioner and it just made it a little

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.470 
conditioner and it just made it a little
donkey<00:02:09.290> so<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.950> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.310> counteract<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
donkey so to kind of counteract that the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240 
donkey so to kind of counteract that the
best<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.800> kept<00:02:14.010> putting

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
best I could I just kept putting

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.870 
best I could I just kept putting
spraying<00:02:14.880> water<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.630> lot<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.700> kind

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
spraying water in it a lot so that kind

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.930 
spraying water in it a lot so that kind
of<00:02:17.940> helped<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.240> little<00:02:18.390> bit<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> um<00:02:20.280> there's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
of helped a little bit but um there's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.170 
of helped a little bit but um there's
that<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.630> also<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.770> think<00:02:23.130> another<00:02:23.670> reason<00:02:23.910> why

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that and also I think another reason why

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.850 
that and also I think another reason why
they<00:02:24.510> say<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.320> long<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.830> because

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
they say it in so long is because

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.910 
they say it in so long is because
they're<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.610> tiny<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:28.410> also<00:02:28.620> making

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
they're so tiny and that's also making

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
they're so tiny and that's also making
it<00:02:29.070> very<00:02:29.190> hard<00:02:29.340> for<00:02:29.580> me<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> figure<00:02:30.060> out<00:02:30.300> if<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it very hard for me to figure out if I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280 
it very hard for me to figure out if I
have<00:02:30.720> them<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:30.990> out<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:32.750> they're<00:02:33.750> mostly<00:02:33.900> out

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have them all out but they're mostly out

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
have them all out but they're mostly out
and<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.550> still<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.760> few<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.120> them<00:02:36.239> n<00:02:36.390> who

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and if it's still a few of them n who

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.320 
and if it's still a few of them n who
cares<00:02:37.970> it'll<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.330> that's

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
cares it'll be all right so that's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.110 
cares it'll be all right so that's
really<00:02:42.540> all<00:02:42.690> I've<00:02:43.019> got<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.739> I'm<00:02:44.730> sure<00:02:44.940> I'll<00:02:45.090> be

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
really all I've got and I'm sure I'll be

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.479
