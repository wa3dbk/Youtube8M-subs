00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.510
 very good in this video we will see 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.760
 how to activate an iphone is to say how 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.370
 activate it if we do not have the sim card 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.760
 original this method is available 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.000
 only for iphone 3gs and iphone 4 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.550
 in this case we have an iphone 3gs that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 it is not free and is subject to the operator 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 haiti antrim we do not have the sim card 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 of that operator so we can not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.120
 activate it in a traditional way to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.370
 to be able to activate what we are going to use 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.989
 tool that is called redsnow that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.150
 It is available for both windows and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.830
 for mac and the operation is 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.489
 practically the same for both systems 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.640
 operatives is simply doing 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 jailbreak and it's called activate there are others 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.129
 methods other than this that we have in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.530
 other tutorials for this method 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.110
 we have a small problem since 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 Currently redsnow is only compatible 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.850
 up to version 6.0 and on this iphone 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 we have version 6.1 point 3 installed 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 to solve this we are going to make a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.799
 little trick that we will explain when 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.860
 let's get there we have redsnow the version 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.860
 09 15 v 3 we have to open 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.080
 and once opened it appears that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.240
 we have an iphone connected in this case 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.950
 it does not appear that it is 3gs but it has the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:38.270
 version 6.1 1.3 with new wood round and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.430
 has the base dan 05 16 08 that is not 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 compatible with the trans nou to be able 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.750
 release it in another tutorial we will make a 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.880
 video of how to install a base band 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.979
 compatible with the trans nou to be able 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.330
 release it to be able to do this 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.220
 we also need version 6.0 of the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.200
 operating system downloaded in the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.179
 computer in the description of the video 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.729
 you will have all the download links 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.700
 this would be the little trick that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.679
 we were talking to cheat nou networks and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.150
 that think that we have installed the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.230
 version 6.0 mbe of 6.1 point 3 that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.420
 we have to do is simply 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.730
 we enter extras select ip the cw 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.319
 we selected version 6.0 in this 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.319
 case for iphone 3gs 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 confirms that it is valid we accept 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.180
 this window only appears with the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.910
 iphone3gs with the iphone4 or not and we 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.730
 ask if we have new wood ground or 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.400
 old most of the iphone 3gs usually 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 be new you may not pray 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.080
 identifies at the beginning how it has 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.700
 happened before to us but in the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.290
 description of the video we leave you the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.450
 instructions to know how 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.310
 identify it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.320
 if we do not identify it correctly 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.600
 here we will probably have to do 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.090
 a full official restoration for 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.940
 solve the error losing all the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.980
 data not synchronized simply 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 we will have to leave the iphone in mode 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.500
 recovery and restore it again 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.060
 from itunes in this case I have the new 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.000
 model 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.880
 I select yes 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.880
 I go back one day entered the break 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.400
 I can also from here mark the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.340
 check box install the ipad banner base 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.980
 but in this case I'm not going to do it 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.489
 I'll do it in another tutorial we press 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.150
 next here tells us that we have 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.519
 to leave the iphone in df mode 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.519
 and if we know how to do it, we can do it now 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.490
 and if we do not know it tells us to turn off 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.990
 the Iphone 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.990
 and press next 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.080
 we mark follow the steps that we 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.080
 indicates 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.820
 what is 10 seconds the power button and 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.980
 of home at 10 seconds let go of the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 power and we keep the one of hong pulsed 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.090
 until sometimes I do not recognize it in 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.190
 football mode we can already drop and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.220
 we wait for the process to take place 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.260
 of the jailbreak in this case the version 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.660
 6.1 point 3 and this version of nou networks 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.700
 the jailbreak is emitted test 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.100
 this means that if we restart 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.800
 the device so that everything works 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.510
 correctly included the cydia we are going to 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.720
 have to connect the iphone to 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.800
 computer open redsnow and redo 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.259
 the just boot 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.810
 that is, we do not have to do it again 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.370
 all this process but only the second 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.830
 part that would be just wood 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.020
 let's give a quick camera until 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.020
 finish the jailbreak process 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.199
 the iphone has already been turned on let's see 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.389
 If he no longer asks us to connect 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.389
 iTunes or wifi to continue 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.430
 as we see here it appears next 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.240
 and we can start using the iphone 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.230
 what is happening that now what 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:42.020
 we have with jailbreak in mode is issued 3 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.950
 if we restart the device now we 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.480
 an icon will appear here but not 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.960
 will work for us because we need 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.330
 do the juz boot for it we have to 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.720
 go back to select another 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.770
 time the 6 point version 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.100
 version 6.0 we press ok it appears 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.220
 the message we press again yes or 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.310
 that does not depend on which device 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.560
 let's have 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.530
 Within extras we select just 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.980
 boots and we leave the device again 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.520
 in df mode 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.700
 we turn off as indicated there and follow the 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.530
 instructions as we did before 10 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.720
 seconds power and home at 10 seconds 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.520
 we let go of the power and keep the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.290
 hong we give to fast camera until 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.290
 finalize the edf process 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.870
 on the iPhone we see the pineapple 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.430
 typical bite of efe times I'm not going to what 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.430
 we can close click on quick 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.000
 the device is already turned on 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:01.000
 we wait a bit for cydia to appear 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.970
 already appears and we can enter 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.430
 in the next video we will make a 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.470
 tutorial on how to install the base band 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.050
 compatible with the trans nou to be able 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:21.030
 release it and then we'll make another video 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:24.190
 tutorial on how to download the ios version 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.740
 6.1 points that has jailbreak 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.750
 untethered keeping the base band for 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.180
 that can be re-released 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.860
