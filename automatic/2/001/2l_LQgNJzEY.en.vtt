00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.240 

when<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:03.779> turned<00:00:04.080> off<00:00:04.229> my<00:00:04.350> lathe<00:00:04.620> last<00:00:04.979> night<00:00:05.220> I

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
when I turned off my lathe last night I

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.000 
when I turned off my lathe last night I
noticed<00:00:05.550> a<00:00:05.790> funny<00:00:06.269> thumping<00:00:07.080> noise<00:00:07.380> right

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
noticed a funny thumping noise right

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.030 
noticed a funny thumping noise right
before<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.519> stopped<00:00:09.139> and<00:00:10.139> when<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.379> turn<00:00:10.709> it<00:00:10.889> by

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
before it stopped and when I turn it by

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.689 
before it stopped and when I turn it by
hand<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.669> can<00:00:11.820> hear<00:00:12.030> it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.040 

as<00:00:18.699> you<00:00:18.849> can<00:00:19.000> see<00:00:19.240> what<00:00:19.359> a<00:00:19.390> piece<00:00:19.599> of<00:00:19.779> tape<00:00:20.019> that

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
as you can see what a piece of tape that

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.400 
as you can see what a piece of tape that
I<00:00:20.349> put<00:00:20.529> on<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.740> pulley<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:22.539> happens<00:00:23.199> in

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
I put on the pulley it happens in

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.319 
I put on the pulley it happens in
exactly<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.130> same<00:00:24.160> spot<00:00:24.520> each<00:00:24.910> time<00:00:25.210> around

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:30.329 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.500 

it<00:00:31.329> the<00:00:31.509> noise<00:00:31.830> sounds<00:00:32.830> like<00:00:33.010> it's<00:00:33.220> coming

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it the noise sounds like it's coming

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.660 
it the noise sounds like it's coming
from<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.750> area<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.260> this<00:00:35.829> bearing<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.550> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
from the area in this bearing in the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:47.430 
from the area in this bearing in the
back<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.780> what's<00:00:44.050> odd<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.769> if<00:00:45.460> I<00:00:45.670> reverse<00:00:46.629> the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
back now what's odd is if I reverse the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.410 
back now what's odd is if I reverse the
lathe<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.879> noise<00:00:49.059> goes<00:00:49.390> away

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
lathe the the noise goes away

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.450 
lathe the the noise goes away
immediately<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:54.070> if<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.250> go<00:00:54.430> back

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
immediately and then if I go back

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
immediately and then if I go back
forward

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
forward

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.889 
forward
the<00:00:57.100> noise<00:00:57.370> slowly<00:00:57.940> reappears<00:00:58.629> getting

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
the noise slowly reappears getting

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
the noise slowly reappears getting
louder<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.350> louder

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.000 

and<00:01:53.700> she<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.870> hear<00:01:55.260> even<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.800> higher

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
and she you can hear even at higher

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.740 
and she you can hear even at higher
speech<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.700> hear<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.090> thumping<00:01:57.510> noise<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
speech and hear that thumping noise I

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.570 
speech and hear that thumping noise I
have<00:02:00.750> never<00:02:01.050> heard<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.590> noise<00:02:01.800> before<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
have never heard this noise before in

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.160 
have never heard this noise before in
the<00:02:02.850> last<00:02:03.030> year<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.480> half<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.750> using<00:02:04.080> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the last year and a half of using this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:16.430 
the last year and a half of using this
lathe
