00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.700
 my new supercomputer 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.560
 Imagine a great one maybe 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.120
 but not we know is year of construction 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.679
 computer model and this is mine 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 latest I want you all now 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 show what he can 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.520
 There are quite a lot of innovations 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.830
 the last one as the first year 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 daylight sensor so that goes on when 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.019
 yes, when it is day and there are 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 even here the normal I am 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 show you now the normal first 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.920
 day light sensor because I do it with 1 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 0 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 there goes first on the top of the lamp 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.380
 and yes, all these commands are there 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.790
 and all these things for the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.710
 commands block are available now can here 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.890
 I have also reinstalled over the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 keyboard can not control things 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 The commands are on the hard disk 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 saved time set to zero 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.090
 I do not think about the best eight 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 here is yes must play the creative 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.300
 mode nice weather rainy weather and so on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 on and on 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.800
 I can only use that when I have the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.480
 pc not so special one though 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.480
 So I'll show you the same time 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.110
 who ever after so first you have to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.250
 press a button here 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.500
 you can not see that well now yes 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.290
 right now so switched 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.570
 first thing still trying the daniela 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.229
 switched and now we can here 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 use the row below and then and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.530
 First of all, yes, the hard disks, too 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.090
 Now I want you this first 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 show inner life you can think that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.939
 is one so we were here and there 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.049
 are now the two lamps 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.119
 affiliated 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.790
 the two hard drives as me for two 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.189
 disks are superimposed here the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.649
 others where everything is controlled the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.590
 whole kommandos lies here 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.430
 then i have a dual-core processor 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.140
 processor yes I do not know if the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.729
 Name if you really like it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.659
 can call 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.850
 Anyway, the thing is about two 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.700
 One of those who really hard to grow hard 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 do 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.020
 yes this is normal RAM 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.450
 Here are these at the beginning commands 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.210
 saved here and again the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.220
 graphics card where some things from the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.929
 hard disk also run over it with 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 graphics fan the iss of his 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.870
 connected do so 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 whether'm sorry you never breaks out, I show 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.980
 I always something the hard drive can give you 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.010
 there are now some things there 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.990
 also brings the lamp and at the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 I do not know anybody else what 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.400
 is supposed to represent any modern 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 Art here is the whole thing 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.900
 tangling that looks really hard 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.220
 bad but I still have it 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.860
 at least the overview a bit 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.720
 to keep 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.720
 go down here all the cables and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.820
 the line from the keyboard through and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.630
 yes, here in the bottom row I want 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.620
 just show you are 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.900
 different basic game rules there to 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 example that zombies do not work 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 or criticize the destruction 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.780
 and so on 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.430
 but I think I'll do that in the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
 I will do that as a woman 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.120
 maybe it does not work now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.950
 not directly in the description but yes 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.850
 if you liked it then submit 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.850
 please wait
