00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960 
do this with tie wraps as well and then
like<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.069> original<00:02:15.190> strap<00:02:15.700> went

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
like that but the original strap went

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.089 
like that but the original strap went
all<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.269> way<00:02:16.299> around<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.720> back<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.940 

it's<00:02:21.099> headed<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.730> through<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> hole<00:02:23.019> through

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it's headed in through the hole through

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's headed in through the hole through
the<00:02:24.069> back<00:02:24.220> along<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> other

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the back along there and out the other

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.509 
the back along there and out the other
side<00:02:26.049> but<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.860> meant<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.310> bit

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
side but it meant there was a bit

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.370 
side but it meant there was a bit
strapped<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> hope<00:02:29.140> they're

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
strapped in there and it hope they're

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.800 
strapped in there and it hope they're
healed<00:02:29.790> hitmarker<00:02:30.790> didn't<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:31.329> it<00:02:31.480> he<00:02:31.510> sort

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
healed hitmarker didn't like it he sort

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.539 
healed hitmarker didn't like it he sort
of<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.079> sore<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:32.920> when<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.069> got<00:02:33.250> rid<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> that

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
of a sore but when I got rid of that

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.819 
of a sore but when I got rid of that
then<00:02:34.150> he<00:02:34.269> was<00:02:34.420> fine<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.840> he's<00:02:35.349> done<00:02:35.560> rides

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
then he was fine and he's done rides

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.729 
then he was fine and he's done rides
with<00:02:36.489> no<00:02:37.209> straps<00:02:37.599> on<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.930> front<00:02:38.140> at<00:02:38.290> all<00:02:38.470> there

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
with no straps on the front at all there

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.309 
with no straps on the front at all there
but<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.819> think<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.239> just<00:02:40.480> gives<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.110> bit<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
but I think it just gives you a bit of

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.849 
but I think it just gives you a bit of
extra<00:02:41.620> comfort<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.340> something<00:02:42.760> on
