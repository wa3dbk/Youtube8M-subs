00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.040
 huh 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.540
 a little house for what you have to do 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:37.920
 It's game condition. 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 tamo together so it's tactic 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180
 some tips now from nooks how to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.630
 behave of ct 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.630
 suddenly when there is a live player 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.329
 in the case of dr 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.640
 when we play looks basically 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.640
 do not know what two markers are here 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.539
 in the neon mark here on the pn box with 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.629
 a lot of people say another player 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.330
 the brand aquino in the cobo markup here 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.129
 called a game because of some 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 never at the time suddenly the good mark 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:21.920
 To go to him, he's a big guy. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.599
 normal and 2 marks here at the bifurcation this 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.420
 marking people 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.209
 it can be modified according to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.819
 what is going on around the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.560
 the round for example we wait 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.079
 try to make a wide invasion by doing 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.170
 leaking in the crate or here in my 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.769
 because I myself and vehement about so 2 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.049
 x 1 3 x 1 understood and when there is a 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.709
 live face of tr 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:52.010
 a lot of people like to risk and move forward 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.530
 here at the bifurcation or 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.510
 try to fish and most of the time 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.489
 people are fished sometimes x is left over 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.299
 end up committing you the lost round 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.000
 no round 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.569
 so a tip I give you is the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.569
 next about a car of r talk one 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.239
 My team face plays with team talk 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.840
 with the face of your team and come to see 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.669
 everybody is 5 against 1 will come all 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.700
 world because the guy can be that 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.280
 Mitinho and fishing one at a time 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.160
 wife toni every position and stay all round 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.940
 world to see us the ABR player 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.069
 tr 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.190
 we let the skin plant it calm 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.489
 and we do a resumption in the cup who 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.700
 will make a mark here without giving 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.180
 much face only make a tag 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.780
 should it ABEA we stay well 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.910
 The next step is to give the beque 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.540
 Up to dahlback is not far behind 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:55.549
 not that I do not think the advantage of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.590
 plant there on the na there and let's go now 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.289
 wait, I'll explain to you how it is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.380
 that works beck of them was in the case 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:05.460
 of 2 x 1 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.190
 I advise is that Beck is so 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.830
 I want to plant in it, it will wait until the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.890
 last second to plant is the council 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 beck if it's 2 x 1 1 I came by the globe here 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.680
 to give feedback right 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.170
 already making this mark here and the other 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.850
 comes in the middle he can opt in popular 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.600
 Right here. 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:31.170
 here was to give the right CB- 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.020
 here to prevent oo full of 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.960
 trt I guarantee round invading half or 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.240
 then fire up or the intention that 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.150
 leave him inside the bongue or if he 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.220
 speak to put up google was there 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.650
 to see here to be 2 the intention 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.450
 of the two with him together to eliminate logo 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.470
 and we managed to take refuge 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.040
 rope then guys this tip is very 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.600

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.690
 the guy is a good time, I tried people 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.590
 make this resumption so wanted to play 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.670
 always with the team to not give soft in 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.800
 certain situations 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.190
 I know a lot of the competitive people already 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.490
 You know, this tactic knows what to do. 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.050
 when there is a player left alive and the crew 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.630
 It's starting now It still does not know 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.980
 So this tip is good for you guys. 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.170
