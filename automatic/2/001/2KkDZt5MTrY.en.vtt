00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.280
 see a recipe for a second much 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.370
 very good really exquisite that yes 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.679
 treats of fried green tomatoes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 but parts are baked the dough and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.100
 lucky a completely legal batter 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.990
 so we didn't use new e 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 they are then returned to the breadcrumbs 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 baked in the oven are really delicious 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
 to eat the realization very much 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.520
 simple I'll show you immediately how it is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.079
 do we clean our tomatoes 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.130
 we can cut it into slices is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.770
 important 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.469
 chop some pretty green tomatoes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 to prepare the batter we put in 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.210
 a bowl the starch is good too 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.039
 videos of mysore starch will say 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 we are using the wheat one 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.940
 we put the flax seeds one smoothie 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.620
 nice taking of turmeric and me before 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 I put a whole water in it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 herbs 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.250
 this is tarragon a blade of grass 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250
 Chive 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.600
 cre and sprigs of thyme 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.280
 and 5 sprigs nests may also add 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.950
 a bit of salt that I have the most 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.670
 forgotten about is true now we can 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.680
 put some water at another time 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.510
 batter is ready and you really can't 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.229
 imagine what perfume they all do 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.880
 these herbs chopped in extra pure and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.590
 we can therefore take the con 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.200
 battered tomato relay the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 first in the gmail batter starch of 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.090
 water and then in breadcrumbs 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.860
 we complete with a round of oil and one 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 sprinkle with salt we can bake in 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.580
 180 degrees 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.549
 our green tomatoes are in the shape 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.099
 ready and cooked about 40 minutes 30 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.420
 in the normal oven and the last 5 10 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.310
 minutes with the grill 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.799
 if you have the very high they will suffice 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.280
 really a few seconds will only serve to 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.769
 smell the crumbs well on the surface and 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.110
 ios have eaten one really comes back 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.030
 really good I suggest you make yourself 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.640
 cool before eating them because 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.940
 in the tomato it remains very very hot 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.280
 so if you are not cold you risk 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.170
 just brush them I school brought to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.640
 uphill you first enjoyed a big one 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.640
 see you next kiss bye
