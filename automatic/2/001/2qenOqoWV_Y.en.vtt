all right here you're going to solve
this<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:05.040> half<00:04:05.250> piece<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:06.269> you're<00:04:06.450> going<00:04:06.570> to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
this the half piece so you're going to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.530 
this the half piece so you're going to
go<00:04:06.810> see<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:07.470> by<00:04:07.650> piece<00:04:07.890> right<00:04:08.370> here<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.850> turn

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
go see this by piece right here I turn

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.280 
go see this by piece right here I turn
it<00:04:09.660> up<00:04:10.850> like<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.000> said<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.480> bags<00:04:12.720> are<00:04:12.900> going<00:04:13.140> out

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
it up like I said my bags are going out

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.720 
it up like I said my bags are going out
but<00:04:13.560> I'm<00:04:13.680> back<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.100> we're<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> same

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
but I'm back and we're on the same

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.160 
but I'm back and we're on the same
situation<00:04:15.470> they're<00:04:16.470> going<00:04:16.650> with

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
situation they're going with

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.150 
situation they're going with
and<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:18.160> right<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:19.770> now<00:04:20.770> you're<00:04:20.890> going<00:04:21.070> to

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
and so right here now you're going to

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.300 
and so right here now you're going to
solve<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.870> half<00:04:22.870> piece<00:04:23.140> right<00:04:23.410> here<00:04:23.440> you're

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
solve this half piece right here you're

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.000 
solve this half piece right here you're
going<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.520> want<00:04:24.670> to<00:04:24.760> see<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.690> um<00:04:26.080> not<00:04:26.980> this

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
going to want to see this um not this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.820 
going to want to see this um not this
white<00:04:27.430> Bronco<00:04:27.790> this<00:04:28.120> isn't<00:04:28.420> complete<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.650> so

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
white Bronco this isn't complete this so

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.130 
white Bronco this isn't complete this so
I<00:04:29.890> can<00:04:29.920> go<00:04:30.310> right<00:04:30.460> here<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.870> you're<00:04:31.990> going<00:04:32.080> to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
I can go right here and you're going to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.130 
I can go right here and you're going to
turn<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.560> main<00:04:32.770> part<00:04:33.460> toward<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.360> for<00:04:34.960> that

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
turn the main part toward you for that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.310 
turn the main part toward you for that
move<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.220> too<00:04:37.030> lazy<00:04:38.400> now<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:40.450> is<00:04:40.510> basic<00:04:41.140> you

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
move it too lazy now this is basic you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
move it too lazy now this is basic you
know<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:41.830> turn<00:04:42.640> it<00:04:42.820> inward<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.980> so<00:04:44.980> far<00:04:45.190> you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
know just turn it inward and so far you

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.920 
know just turn it inward and so far you
have<00:04:45.430> all<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:47.670> but<00:04:48.670> now<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:49.630> have<00:04:49.750> this

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
have all of it but now you have this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.720 
have all of it but now you have this
you're<00:04:50.470> going<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.710> see<00:04:51.100> we<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:51.550> did<00:04:51.700> that

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
you're going to see we just did that

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.000 
you're going to see we just did that
turn<00:04:52.540> out<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:52.840> South<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.620> Rubik's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
turn out like this South the Rubik's

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.210 
turn out like this South the Rubik's
twist<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:55.950> turn<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.550> big<00:04:58.240> blast<00:04:58.720> big<00:04:58.960> part

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
twist you turn the big blast big part

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.320 
twist you turn the big blast big part
told<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.420> that<00:05:01.650> turn<00:05:02.650> it<00:05:02.770> sideways<00:05:02.970> okay<00:05:03.970> now

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
told you that turn it sideways okay now

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.550 
told you that turn it sideways okay now
you're<00:05:04.570> going<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.810> solve<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.320> piece<00:05:05.530> right

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you're going to solve this piece right

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.850 
you're going to solve this piece right
here<00:05:05.710> so<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:06.640> piece<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.240> basic<00:05:07.660> terms<00:05:08.440> white

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
here so this piece is basic terms white

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.060 
here so this piece is basic terms white
triangle<00:05:09.400> right<00:05:09.490> here<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.320> main<00:05:11.680> part<00:05:12.010> it

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
triangle right here so the main part it

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.200 
triangle right here so the main part it
faces<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:13.500> push<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:14.910> snow<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:15.970> lines

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
faces you and push it in snow it lines

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.630 
faces you and push it in snow it lines
up<00:05:16.420> so<00:05:17.380> now<00:05:17.470> you<00:05:17.530> only<00:05:17.800> have<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:18.040> solve<00:05:18.280> two

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
up so now you only have to solve two

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.160 
up so now you only have to solve two
more<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.940> these<00:05:19.060> which<00:05:19.480> should<00:05:19.810> be<00:05:19.960> pretty

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
more of these which should be pretty

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.690 
more of these which should be pretty
easy<00:05:20.820> now<00:05:21.820> easy<00:05:22.500> way<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.800> this<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.340> easiest

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
easy now easy way to do this the easiest

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.310 
easy now easy way to do this the easiest
part<00:05:25.380> turn<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.560> strangle<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.750> way<00:05:28.750> so

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
part turn the strangle that way so

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.190 
part turn the strangle that way so
little<00:05:29.770> bit<00:05:29.860> stressed<00:05:30.160> skin<00:05:30.730> faces<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.360> then

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
little bit stressed skin faces you then

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.260 
little bit stressed skin faces you then
you<00:05:32.530> can<00:05:32.680> turn<00:05:32.800> like<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.040> handle<00:05:33.400> just<00:05:33.970> push<00:05:34.240> it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
you can turn like a handle just push it

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.620 
you can turn like a handle just push it
forward<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.770> already<00:05:35.950> solve<00:05:36.220> that<00:05:36.340> piece

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
forward and you already solve that piece

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.900 
forward and you already solve that piece
now<00:05:37.630> here's<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.200> easiest<00:05:38.530> part<00:05:38.760> we're<00:05:39.760> going

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
now here's the easiest part we're going

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.020 
now here's the easiest part we're going
to<00:05:40.000> do<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.270> you're<00:05:40.330> going<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.540> turn<00:05:40.750> this<00:05:42.030> and

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
to do is you're going to turn this and

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.180 
to do is you're going to turn this and
so<00:05:43.600> but<00:05:43.840> now<00:05:44.020> you're<00:05:44.320> going<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.530> turn<00:05:44.740> this

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
so but now you're going to turn this

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.220 
so but now you're going to turn this
middle<00:05:45.610> piece<00:05:45.790> all<00:05:46.570> right<00:05:47.040> clockwise<00:05:49.020> push<00:05:50.020> it

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
middle piece all right clockwise push it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.140 
middle piece all right clockwise push it
in<00:05:50.440> there<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:50.920> you're<00:05:51.250> probably<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:51.940> may

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
in there and you're probably you may

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.230 
in there and you're probably you may
have<00:05:52.360> to<00:05:52.540> move<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.290> out<00:05:53.500> of<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.650> way<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.860> bit

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
have to move this out of the way a bit

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.600 
have to move this out of the way a bit
but<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.480> of<00:05:55.960> course<00:05:56.230> it<00:05:56.380> doesn't<00:05:56.560> fit<00:05:56.890> so<00:05:57.550> you

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
but and of course it doesn't fit so you

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.430 
but and of course it doesn't fit so you
want<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.180> turn<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.510> last<00:05:58.810> piece<00:05:59.080> your<00:05:59.290> hair

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
want to turn this last piece your hair

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.540 
want to turn this last piece your hair
in<00:06:00.100> word<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:02.620> just<00:06:02.800> start<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.340> white

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
in word and you just start the white

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.480 
in word and you just start the white
ball<00:06:03.850> now<00:06:04.450> i'm<00:06:04.780> going<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.050> show<00:06:05.230> you<00:06:05.260> what<00:06:06.160> how

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
ball now i'm going to show you what how

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.060 
ball now i'm going to show you what how
to<00:06:06.550> do<00:06:06.790> it<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.090> blue<00:06:07.270> ball<00:06:07.540> because<00:06:08.170> it<00:06:08.770> might

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
to do it the blue ball because it might

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.540 
to do it the blue ball because it might
look<00:06:09.430> different<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:10.890> stuff<00:06:11.890> and<00:06:12.190> it<00:06:12.370> make<00:06:12.520> a

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
look different and stuff and it make a

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.090 
look different and stuff and it make a
computer
