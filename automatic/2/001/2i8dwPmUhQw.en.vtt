00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
if we want to track the motion of a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.080 
if we want to track the motion of a
moving<00:00:33.300> surface<00:00:33.630> such<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> conveyor<00:00:34.350> or

typically<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.300> would<00:00:39.450> apply<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
typically what we do is we would apply a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
typically what we do is we would apply a
wheel<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> encoder<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> track<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
wheel to that encoder and track the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
wheel to that encoder and track the
motion<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.420> moving<00:00:42.750> surface<00:00:43.219> in<00:00:44.219> some

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
motion of that moving surface in some

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.860 
motion of that moving surface in some
cases<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.030> surface<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.539> moving<00:00:45.690> very

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
cases that surface is moving very

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200 
cases that surface is moving very
rapidly<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:47.129> may<00:00:47.370> vibrate<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.030> have

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
rapidly it may vibrate or have

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
rapidly it may vibrate or have
irregularities<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.399> cause

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
irregularities to it and that can cause

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.400 
irregularities to it and that can cause
the<00:00:50.820> encoder<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.750> wheel<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.230> lose

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the encoder and the wheel to lose

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
the encoder and the wheel to lose
contact<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.309> surface<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
contact with that surface when this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
contact with that surface when this
happens<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:55.110> lose<00:00:55.289> counts<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
happens we lose counts and we have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
happens we lose counts and we have
inaccurate<00:00:56.910> feedback<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> question<00:00:58.500> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
inaccurate feedback so the question is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
inaccurate feedback so the question is
how<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.010> maintain<00:00:59.160> constant<00:00:59.940> pressure<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
how do we maintain constant pressure and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
how do we maintain constant pressure and
contact<00:01:01.649> between<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.550> wheel<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.300> moving

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
contact between the wheel and the moving

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
contact between the wheel and the moving
surface<00:01:03.989> well<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> past<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.460> we've<00:01:05.640> done

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
surface well in the past what we've done

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.380 
surface well in the past what we've done
is<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.049> fabricate<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.189> bracket<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
is we would fabricate a bracket and a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.289 
is we would fabricate a bracket and a

pivot shaft or mounting hardware you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
pivot shaft or mounting hardware you
need<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.600> find<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> spring<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> proper<00:01:14.100> size

and tension all these pieces and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.440 
and tension all these pieces and
components<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:17.520> additional<00:01:17.970> costs

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
components they're additional costs

additional headache and that's what led
