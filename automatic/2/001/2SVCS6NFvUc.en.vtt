00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello to everyone as promised today 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.450
 talk about the basics of color correction 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 photoshop before starting this lesson i 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.480
 searched the internet 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.529
 image is worse to end up with 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 its maximum awesome and here in 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 In principle, she is a terrible image 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.269
 and you know, I did everything I could, but then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 I realized that on this I can not explain 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.370
 color correction so let's move on 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.579
 to a normal photo this photo I 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.270
 made on the camera nikon d300 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.450
 his peculiarity is that he is a little bit 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:52.170
 increases the brightness of the color is not quite 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:56.850
 saturated now i'm going through the basics on 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 basics of color correction naturally begin 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 we are either with brightness and contrast or with 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:07.680
 I suggest you always start with 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.810
 exposure so how will it be right 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 in my opinion 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.770
 with a shift it's better to play because 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.070
 sometimes everything is fine but necessary 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.310
 change things people think are 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.350
 for the most part it is not right therefore 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.689
 look at the image they are behind 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.409
 sliders do not try once again 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:39.909
 do not clean anything else then everything will be 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:42.929
 very bad so we set up a shift i 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.340
 it's more accurate we set up the exposure 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.509
 Now we will adjust the brightness contrast 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.080
 Our image brightness is big for us 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.850
 no need therefore we reduce it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.810
 contrast we let's have a little bit 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.149
 increase ok 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.630
 I remind you we are working with the image tab 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.630
 collection 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:15.420
 Now go to edit 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 levels interesting us 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:24.390
 device as a level allows us to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 first see all input values â€‹â€‹in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.550
 second edit parameters since 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 we need to edit this total 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.489
 brightness 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.610
 bluff brightness and shadow brightness 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.970
 In this case, edit us especially that 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.040
 do not need anything since we have already corrected 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.510
 here game plugins 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.560
 but bluff brightness I would still 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 slightly increased it depicted this 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:06.950
 will give us the opportunity to make an image 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.950
 the most saturated and will give the opportunity 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.090
 make these little ones visible 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:21.810
 aspects of the skin but about it a little 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:24.290
 later and so tools like 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.690
 vibration hue saturation 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.690
 color balance black and white photo filter 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.250
 and channel mixing I'm not telling 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.200
 will be so how to manage when working 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.160
 if you start photoshop work 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.000
 can be easy 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.700
 Now I will introduce you to this 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.890
 interesting tool like selective 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.230
 color correction is the essence of this tool 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.440
 is to edit the whole 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.870
 color picker 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.620
 let's start with red 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.080
 we now have to make 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.000
 each color is its color I mean red 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.019
 red green green blue 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.080
 blue let's start red 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 a little brighter but 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.250
 make sure that with the way we move 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 sliders 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:28.080
 skin changes as well because it has 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.070
 it also has a red base and a yellow one 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.400
 basis so when you 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:37.500
 edit the yellow colors turn on 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:41.600
 it's attention and tune magenta 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:49.610
 yellow is a constituent of every color and 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.610
 Black also edit the green color 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:11.340
 now go blue I do not lead color 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.340
 and we get something like this 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:21.419
 customize his hat and do a little bit 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.370
 I'm darker now turn to purple 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:28.770
 completely as we see the purple here 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:32.500
 there is almost nothing and set up white 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:36.099
 if your camera catches white balance 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.500
 or do you think that white seems to be 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.560
 don't edit normally 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.009
 I have a white area in this case 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.750
 light filter stood in order to glare 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:55.110
 were more interesting so white 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.400
 areas and edit required so 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.360
 neutral what is neutral colors 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.479
 this is an addition to the image in this or that 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.880
 different degrees of different colors of blue 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.639
 magenta yellow or black in this 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.349
 All colors are affected 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.129
 what are black colors are all shadows and 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.500
 shadow areas 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:21.900
 this allows us to make an image 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.770
 most contrast is more accurate the most 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:31.180
 clear this does not apply to clear boys 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:33.400
 This concerns clarity here such see 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.469
 all these facial wrinkles and folds on 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 the skin has become more visible so 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:42.120
 look at the finished result 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:50.610
 and look at what we had 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:58.780
 the image is not bright and contrast 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:07:03.100
 and after done over our operations, we 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.100
 get a nice picture good luck to you 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.170
 editing good luck to you 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.900
 editing your videos 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.480
 learn and learn photoshop hope 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.470
 my lesson was useful to you 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.470
 until
