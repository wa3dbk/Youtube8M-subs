00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.570
 the importance of proteins what 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.880
 it means choosing good quality but 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.300
 then it actually means mean 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.879
 various things on the one hand there is capacity 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.399
 of proteins to be absorbed 

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.770
 metabolized used and this comes 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.059
 measured with various parameters enough 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.760
 complex one of this is value 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.879
 biological protein you told me but 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.739
 this is a very technical speech 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.560
 what I mean when I say 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 good quality protein and make sure 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.470
 that if you introduce proteins of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.899
 animal origin 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.000
 these animals have been fed with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.430
 most natural criteria possible because 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 this is because we have actually seen it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.590
 that there is a difference in the content of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.750
 meats for example that come from 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 animals bred with cereals compared 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 to meat of bred animals 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 the same thing exclusively for grazing 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 it can be said for the lifestyle 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.810
 animal's overall for example 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.569
 animals that are basically 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 immobilized very narrow spaces 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.149
 to increase the weight the most 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.249
 possible of course will produce 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.469
 meats that are much fatter than a 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:28.469
 animal that instead moves and therefore more 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.850
 full of muscle so when I talk about 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.799
 I mean good quality protein 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.450
 especially this I mean the fish is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.509
 fed on a farm 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.459
 it was caught in the sea, that is, unfortunately 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.639
 although I realize that it adds a 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.619
 further complexity for the consumer 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:45.990
 talk generically about proteins has 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.100
 little meaning really should be 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 understand that animal as you know 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.360
 lived and how it was fed because the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.440
 a direct consequence of what has been 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 given to him to eat is what I eat 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.509
 me when I take that kind of meat 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.159
 so this is a topic we talk about 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.590
 little but actually the most important topic 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.130
 regards this discussion on 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130
 animal proteins
