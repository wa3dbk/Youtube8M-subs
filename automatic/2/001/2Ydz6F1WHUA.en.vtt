00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.810
 the universal epistle of santiago 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.930
 santiago chapter 1 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.750
 Jacob Servant of God and Lord Jesus 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.710
 the christ to the twelve tribes that are 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.890
 scattered health my brothers 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 tenet for supreme joy when you are in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 various tests knowing that the test 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 of your faith works patience and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.919
 patience consummate the work so that you are 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 perfect and whole without missing in any 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.730
 thing and if any of you is missing 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.030
 of wisdom ask the god which gives 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.660
 all abundantly and without reproach and you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.810
 it will be given but ask in faith not doubting 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 nothing because the doubter is similar to 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.410
 the wave of the sea that is moved by the wind 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 and is thrown from one part to another 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.180
 certainly do not think the man that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.510
 will receive anything from the Lord the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 double- minded man is inconstant in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.159
 all his ways 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 the brother who is of low luck glÃ²ries 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 in his highness plus he who is rich in his 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.189
 baseness because he will pass as the flower of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.000
 the grass because the sun came out with ardor 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 the grass dries up and its flower falls and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.060
 his beautiful appearance perishes so too 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.119
 the rich will fade in all his 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.390
 paths blessed the man who 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.030
 patiently endure temptation because 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 when he was reproved he will receive the crown 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.070
 of life that God has promised to those who 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.800
 they love him 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 When someone is tempted, do not say it is 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.729
 Tempted by God because God can not be 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.920
 tempted of evils nor does he tempt any 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.500
 but each one is tempted when his 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.160
 own concupiscence is attracted and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.430
 primed and concupiscence after 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.320
 has conceived gives light to sin and the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.709
 sin being fulfilled begets death 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.739
 my beloved brothers is not reid all 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.410
 good gift and every perfect gift is from 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.560
 high that descends from the father of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.830
 lights in which there is no moving or 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.980
 shadow of variation 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.440
 of his will has engendered us by the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.110
 word of truth to be the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.660
 the first fruits of his creatures 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.540
 for this my brothers loved all 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 man be quick to hear slow to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 speak slow to turn around because anger 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.310
 of man does not work the justice of God 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.980
 whereby leaving all filth and 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.530
 remnants of malice received with 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.260
 meekness the word ingested in 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.320
 you who can make saves 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.459
 your souls more thirsters of the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.220
 word and not only hears 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.650
 fooling yourselves because if 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.740
 Some hear the word and do not put it 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.220
 This work is similar to the man who 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.110
 consider your natural face in a mirror 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.550
 because he considered himself and he 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 was and now he forgot that such was more 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.290
 the one that had looked attentively in the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.350
 law of perfect freedom and there 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.620
 persevered in it not being heard 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.160
 life notice yes no doer of the work this 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.050
 such will be blessed in his deed if 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.350
 some think to be religious among 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.110
 you and does not endorse his tongue but 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.550
 that deceives your heart the religion of 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.220
 such is vain 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.160
 pure religion and without blemish in front of 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 god and father is visiting the orphans 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.840
 and the widows in their tribulations and 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.840
 save without more
