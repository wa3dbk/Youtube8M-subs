contemporary works that people might be

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.529 
contemporary works that people might be
looking<00:06:23.860> for<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.610> I<00:06:25.060> think<00:06:25.300> that's<00:06:25.449> really

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
looking for and I think that's really

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:26.790 
looking for and I think that's really
good<00:06:25.810> for<00:06:25.840> publishers<00:06:26.380> because<00:06:26.620> they're

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
good for publishers because they're

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.529 
good for publishers because they're

looking for new ways to distribute their

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.520 
looking for new ways to distribute their
work<00:06:29.250> but<00:06:30.250> I<00:06:30.340> also<00:06:30.490> think<00:06:30.669> this<00:06:31.210> is<00:06:31.419> really<00:06:32.050> an

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
work but I also think this is really an

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.089 
work but I also think this is really an
amazing<00:06:32.889> opportunity<00:06:33.599> for<00:06:34.599> just<00:06:35.349> people<00:06:35.979> who

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
amazing opportunity for just people who

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.310 
amazing opportunity for just people who
want<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.430> read<00:06:36.639> because<00:06:37.300> there's<00:06:37.930> never<00:06:38.199> been

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
want to read because there's never been

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.629 
want to read because there's never been

to talk about what they've read reading
some<00:06:45.680> people<00:06:45.800> can<00:06:45.949> say<00:06:46.249> reading<00:06:46.520> is<00:06:46.699> a

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
some people can say reading is a

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.080 
some people can say reading is a
solitary<00:06:47.150> experience<00:06:47.919> and<00:06:48.919> some<00:06:49.400> aspects<00:06:49.939> of

writing so we think this is a good to
change<00:07:17.840> how<00:07:18.259> people<00:07:18.289> read<00:07:18.830> and<00:07:19.250> and<00:07:19.490> really
