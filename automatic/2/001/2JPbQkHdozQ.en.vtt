00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:13.150
 and so and loaded the entire rocket type 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.889
 wood on the horn now I want to try on 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 the temperature that is now I will show you 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:25.360
 that firewood is burning 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.579
 here they say it means rocket heater 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.250
 Type here again I used 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.210
 pyrolysis arena well as there are two 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.000
 the address of this slot 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.109
 slots and these in the holes for auto fresh 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.570
 air and oxygen and gas which 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.179
 are obtained in the process of burning wood 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.059
 sunbathe on the pipe itself trying 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.059
 show here the flame well what is dangerous and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 fix the phone often put this 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.339
 iron plate and try to measure 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.469
 when it heats up quickly 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:06.670
 it is impossible for Komi we have here 200 300 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:09.920
 Exit 200 degrees 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 about 200 degrees at the exit that is he 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 here I would not recommend a group 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.310
 keep putting the plate so like one 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.979
 hand is not comfortable though let's go now 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.670
 then put on the bill 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 temperature on the plate temperature even 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.229
 outside zerg ground reaches 0 degrees 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:39.649
 Now I will do everything myself 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:43.729
 it is not clear where it is cold glitters that 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.250
 not here about 8 this is adequate guys 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.420
 an hour really 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:55.509
 it is snowing cold and even in the shadows 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:01.810
 I will show the toilet, that is, it does not harbor 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.810
 here is the transit ice 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 Iâ€™ll put a plate and mark it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.740
 us as it warms until you let 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.740
 temperature and 5 degrees we take 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.390
 temperature rises in front at the 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.730
 business on duty to thick plate so 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.390
 thick millimeter 2 probably no one 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.260
 threesomes 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.720
 I haven't tried a welding machine here. 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.500
 whether he cooks do not overflow 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.950
 strips well, too, how many will I look there 60 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.950
 degrees 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.210
 70 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.680
 80 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.379
 the temperature is rising before our eyes 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:34.340
 90 Well, in general, I will shoot because 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:43.550
 then there will be crosses back and so 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:47.780
 Here the tests have passed successfully 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.680
 literally no more than one minute here I am 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:58.390
 the light of the snow that is already boiling 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.740
 shkvarchit such rocket stove 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.940
 if the information was helpful to you 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.320
 put your fingers subscribe to the channel 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.600
 if there are any considerations on this 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.200
 write about the comments under the video 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.200
 bye everyone
