power<00:02:00.299> cells<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> fundamentally<00:02:01.409> different

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
power cells are fundamentally different

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.190 
power cells are fundamentally different
than<00:02:02.009> conventional<00:02:02.369> cells<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.750> notice<00:02:04.020> all

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
than conventional cells you notice all

than conventional cells you notice all
the<00:02:04.320> metal<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> back

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
the metal is on the back

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320 
the metal is on the back
and<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.380> allows<00:02:06.680> us<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.520> use<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.700> metal<00:02:08.240> on

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and this allows us to use that metal on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.779 
and this allows us to use that metal on
the<00:02:08.420> back<00:02:08.630> as<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.410> foundational<00:02:10.100> support<00:02:10.550> of

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the back as the foundational support of

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.390 
the back as the foundational support of
the<00:02:11.000> cell<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:12.530> means<00:02:12.709> we<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:12.980> also<00:02:13.100> make<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
the cell it means we can also make the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850 
the cell it means we can also make the
filler<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.940> silicon<00:02:14.360> much<00:02:14.540> thinner<00:02:14.900> meaning

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
filler the silicon much thinner meaning

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.559 
filler the silicon much thinner meaning
that<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.819> allowed<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.030> flex<00:02:17.420> a

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
that it is actually allowed to flex a

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.350 
that it is actually allowed to flex a
little<00:02:17.810> bit<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.170> as<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.209> we've<00:02:20.209> got

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
little bit and as you can see we've got

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.300 
little bit and as you can see we've got
a<00:02:20.420> curved<00:02:20.750> glass<00:02:21.050> surface<00:02:21.860> we've<00:02:22.010> got<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
a curved glass surface we've got to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.699 
a curved glass surface we've got to
match<00:02:22.430> up<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.670> here<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.959> ability<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.350> bend

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
match up to here so the ability to bend

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.870 
match up to here so the ability to bend
is<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.670> very<00:02:25.910> good<00:02:27.100> additionally<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.760> have

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
is is very good additionally we have

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.940 
is is very good additionally we have
much<00:02:29.090> higher<00:02:29.330> power<00:02:29.630> density<00:02:29.989> than

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
much higher power density than

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.070 
much higher power density than
conventional<00:02:31.520> cells<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.600> means<00:02:32.900> out<00:02:33.050> of

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
conventional cells so that means out of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.830 
conventional cells so that means out of
out<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.980> same<00:02:34.250> space<00:02:34.940> constrained<00:02:35.480> area

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
out of the same space constrained area

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.710 
out of the same space constrained area
we<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.650> actually<00:02:36.830> harvest<00:02:37.190> 50%<00:02:38.180> more<00:02:38.330> energy

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
we can actually harvest 50% more energy

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960 
we can actually harvest 50% more energy
than<00:02:38.840> conventional<00:02:38.900> cells<00:02:39.709> could<00:02:39.970> I'm

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
than conventional cells could I'm

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.250 
than conventional cells could I'm
actually<00:02:41.120> quite<00:02:41.390> excited<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.870> work<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.110> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
actually quite excited to work on this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.130 
actually quite excited to work on this
project<00:02:42.500> because<00:02:43.040> when<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.550> was<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> kid<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:44.930> we

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
project because when I was a kid all we

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.290 
project because when I was a kid all we
would<00:02:45.290> ever<00:02:45.380> see<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.400> mix<00:02:46.550> solar<00:02:46.940> and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
would ever see when you mix solar and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.440 
would ever see when you mix solar and
cars<00:02:47.600> was<00:02:48.500> these<00:02:48.650> small<00:02:49.120> very<00:02:50.120> impractical

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
cars was these small very impractical

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.570 
cars was these small very impractical
cars<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.590> flew<00:02:51.800> across<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.100> Australian

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
cars that flew across the Australian

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000 
cars that flew across the Australian
desert<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.930> project<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.500> extremely

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
desert this project is extremely

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.380 
desert this project is extremely
exciting<00:02:55.459> because<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:56.060> we're<00:02:56.209> actually

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
exciting because here we're actually

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.070 
exciting because here we're actually
taking<00:02:56.780> real<00:02:57.709> solar<00:02:57.980> panels<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.080> we're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
taking real solar panels and we're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.190 
taking real solar panels and we're
adapting<00:03:00.590> them<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:01.430> fit<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:01.700> top<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.150> car<00:03:02.390> but

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
adapting them to fit on top of a car but

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.199 
adapting them to fit on top of a car but
it's<00:03:03.350> not<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.769> lightweight<00:03:04.310> car<00:03:04.940> that's<00:03:05.120> gonna

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it's not a lightweight car that's gonna

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.509 
it's not a lightweight car that's gonna
fly<00:03:05.390> across<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> Australian<00:03:06.200> outback<00:03:06.519> it's

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
fly across the Australian outback it's

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.190 
fly across the Australian outback it's
an<00:03:07.790> everyday<00:03:08.060> car<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:08.720> could<00:03:08.870> expect<00:03:09.140> to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
an everyday car that we could expect to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.569 
an everyday car that we could expect to
see<00:03:09.380> in<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> cities<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> highways

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
see in the cities and on the highways

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.460 
see in the cities and on the highways
this<00:03:11.120> solution<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.959> couple<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
this solution we a couple the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.930 
this solution we a couple the
infrastructure<00:03:13.070> with<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.310> solar<00:03:13.670> on<00:03:13.850> the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
infrastructure with the solar on the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.960 
infrastructure with the solar on the
vehicle<00:03:14.500> essentially<00:03:15.500> isn't<00:03:16.280> reliant<00:03:16.790> on<00:03:16.910> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
vehicle essentially isn't reliant on a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.870 
vehicle essentially isn't reliant on a
grid<00:03:17.269> anymore<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.709> you're<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.070> an<00:03:19.670> area

grid anymore and so if you're in an area
that<00:03:20.180> doesn't<00:03:20.720> have<00:03:21.190> electricity<00:03:22.190> either

that doesn't have electricity either
