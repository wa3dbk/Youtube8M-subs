tobogganing a pain to you but they drop

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.940 
tobogganing a pain to you but they drop
them<00:01:47.569> off<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.899> go<00:01:48.020> out<00:01:48.170> skiing<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.709> the<00:01:48.770> day

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
them off and go out skiing for the day

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.919 
them off and go out skiing for the day
and<00:01:49.190> then<00:01:49.280> coming<00:01:49.459> afternoon<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.270> everyone's

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
and then coming afternoon and everyone's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.690 
and then coming afternoon and everyone's
happy

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.800 

so<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.729> think<00:01:57.820> we<00:01:58.000> generally<00:01:58.450> start<00:01:58.540> with<00:01:58.720> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
so I think we generally start with a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.899 
so I think we generally start with a
quick<00:01:58.960> conversation<00:01:59.380> get<00:02:00.340> where<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.640> eat

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
quick conversation get where this eat

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.910 
quick conversation get where this eat
before<00:02:01.330> what<00:02:01.600> runs<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:02.110> runs<00:02:02.290> they<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.740> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
before what runs what runs they like to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.870 
before what runs what runs they like to
do<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:04.290> how<00:02:05.290> they<00:02:05.500> kind<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.799> ski<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.430> then

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
do and how they kind of ski a and then

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.730 
do and how they kind of ski a and then
after<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.299> you<00:02:07.479> know<00:02:07.509> we<00:02:08.200> usually<00:02:08.440> take<00:02:08.590> them

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
after that you know we usually take them

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.469
