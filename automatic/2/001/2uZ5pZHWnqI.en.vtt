this in multiplayer and not just

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
this in multiplayer and not just
single-player<00:00:23.519> because<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> looks<00:00:24.359> like

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
single-player because it looks like

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
single-player because it looks like
you'll<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.170> fun<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.590> use<00:00:25.740> online<00:00:26.090> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
right here we have some actual gun game

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.849 
right here we have some actual gun game
playing<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.510> looks<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> m60<00:00:31.619> from

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

black<00:00:32.070> ops<00:00:32.279> 1<00:00:32.719> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.469> these<00:00:34.559> games<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:35.070> the

ak-74 you one of my favorites and right
here<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> noticed<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.719> sentry

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
here I noticed that we have a sentry

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439 
here I noticed that we have a sentry
turret<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.910> nice<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
turret and that's pretty nice to see you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.299 
turret and that's pretty nice to see you
recall<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> use<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> skill<00:01:01.680> streaks<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> stuff

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
recall to use a skill streaks and stuff

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.929 
recall to use a skill streaks and stuff
in<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> game<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.280> got<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.640> normal

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
in the game so just got some normal

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.910 
in the game so just got some normal
gameplay<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.479> here

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.370 

right<00:01:14.920> here<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.280> says<00:01:15.460> 4v4<00:01:16.270> over<00:01:16.750> Wi-Fi<00:01:16.930> which

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
right here it says 4v4 over Wi-Fi which

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.170 
right here it says 4v4 over Wi-Fi which
is<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> same<00:01:17.830> as<00:01:18.040> resistance<00:01:18.580> burning<00:01:18.940> sighs

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
is the same as resistance burning sighs

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.560 
is the same as resistance burning sighs
and<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:21.310> I'd<00:01:21.430> expect<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.940> see<00:01:22.180> smaller

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
and I think I'd expect to see smaller

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.200 
and I think I'd expect to see smaller
maps<00:01:22.900> because<00:01:23.140> there's<00:01:23.440> less<00:01:23.590> people<00:01:24.210> say

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
maps because there's less people say

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.540 
maps because there's less people say
that<00:01:25.420> will<00:01:25.510> make<00:01:25.660> more<00:01:25.840> sense<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.280> he

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
that will make more sense and he

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.280 
that will make more sense and he
actually<00:01:27.970> shows<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.360> some<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.660> maps<00:01:28.870> this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
actually shows you some of the maps this

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.930 
actually shows you some of the maps this
looks<00:01:29.590> like<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.770> new<00:01:30.010> map<00:01:30.220> right<00:01:30.400> here<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
looks like a new map right here but the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.660 
looks like a new map right here but the
other<00:01:31.120> ones<00:01:31.420> do<00:01:32.140> look<00:01:32.350> similar<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.610> familiar

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
other ones do look similar and familiar

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.140 
other ones do look similar and familiar
to<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.960> Blackhawks<00:01:35.400> ones<00:01:36.400> maps<00:01:36.910> like<00:01:37.090> this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
to the Blackhawks ones maps like this

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.510 
to the Blackhawks ones maps like this
one<00:01:37.450> right<00:01:37.570> here<00:01:37.630> in<00:01:37.810> nuketown<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.830> was<00:01:38.980> pretty

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
one right here in nuketown it was pretty

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.090 
one right here in nuketown it was pretty
much<00:01:39.670> exactly<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.330> same<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:41.710> one<00:01:41.950> right

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
much exactly the same and this one right

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.980 
much exactly the same and this one right
here<00:01:42.310> looks<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.640> launched<00:01:43.420> because<00:01:43.840> it's

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
here looks like launched because it's

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780 
here looks like launched because it's
got<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.260> Rocky<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.860> background<00:01:45.250> but<00:01:45.729> it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
got that Rocky in the background but it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.070 
got that Rocky in the background but it
does<00:01:45.940> look<00:01:46.119> like<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.420> been<00:01:46.600> set<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:46.990> a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
does look like it's been set in a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.800 
does look like it's been set in a
different<00:01:47.260> time<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:48.030> slightly<00:01:49.030> modified<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
different time and slightly modified and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.050 
different time and slightly modified and
stuff<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.950> next<00:01:54.190> bit<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.520> know<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:54.910> that

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
stuff in the next bit I know it's that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.640 
stuff in the next bit I know it's that
in<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.300> new<00:01:55.450> town<00:01:55.690> map<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.380> know<00:01:56.440> if<00:01:56.500> this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
in the new town map I don't know if this

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.310 
in the new town map I don't know if this
will<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> more<00:01:57.970> player<00:01:58.270> but<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.810> barriers

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
will be a more player but the barriers

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.290 
will be a more player but the barriers
around<00:01:59.560> edges<00:02:00.130> are<00:02:00.340> actually<00:02:00.400> closing<00:02:01.150> off

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
around edges are actually closing off

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.210 
around edges are actually closing off
the<00:02:01.479> map<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> lot<00:02:02.380> smaller<00:02:02.830> than<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
the map to be a lot smaller than the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.700 
the map to be a lot smaller than the
original<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.780> could<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.140> because<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.500> is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
original so this could be because it is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.060 
original so this could be because it is
4v4<00:02:06.840> online<00:02:07.840> so<00:02:08.110> they<00:02:08.320> probably<00:02:08.470> have<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.860> make

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
4v4 online so they probably have to make

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.550 
4v4 online so they probably have to make
the<00:02:09.220> maps<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:10.149> bit<00:02:10.240> smaller<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:11.380> we'll

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the maps a little bit smaller so we'll

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.940 
the maps a little bit smaller so we'll
see<00:02:11.770> when<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.010> comes<00:02:12.220> up

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.700 

and<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.220> next<00:02:18.490> bit<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:19.090> shows<00:02:19.390> an<00:02:19.710> ak-47

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
and this next bit it shows an ak-47

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.260 
and this next bit it shows an ak-47
which<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.310> favorite<00:02:21.700> guns<00:02:21.850> in

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
which is one of my favorite guns in

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.970 
which is one of my favorite guns in
black<00:02:22.480> horses<00:02:22.840> horses<00:02:23.140> nice<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.620> see<00:02:23.770> that

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
black horses horses nice to see that

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.100 
black horses horses nice to see that
back<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> game<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:28.660> finishing<00:02:29.020> off

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
back in the game and just finishing off

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.290 
back in the game and just finishing off

some screenshots of the game and talk

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.130 
some screenshots of the game and talk
about<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.650> controls<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.090> game<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.959> made

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
about the controls so the game is made

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.140 
about the controls so the game is made
by<00:02:45.200> nihilistic<00:02:46.010> software<00:02:46.550> which<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:46.910> same

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
by nihilistic software which is the same

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.199 
by nihilistic software which is the same
people<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:48.190> resistance<00:02:49.190> burning<00:02:49.550> Skies<00:02:49.819> so

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
people as resistance burning Skies so

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.300 
people as resistance burning Skies so
the<00:02:50.300> controls<00:02:50.660> are<00:02:50.870> very<00:02:51.110> similar<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.650> one<00:02:52.280> of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
the controls are very similar so one of

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.100 
the controls are very similar so one of
the<00:02:52.430> controls<00:02:52.790> is<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> draw<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> grenade<00:02:54.080> you

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the controls is to draw a grenade you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.080 
the controls is to draw a grenade you
just<00:02:54.500> drag<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.010> icon<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.640> side<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
just drag the icon on the side of the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.880 
just drag the icon on the side of the
screen<00:02:56.270> drag<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.470> where<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.680> want<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
screen drag it to where you want to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.170 
screen drag it to where you want to
throw<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.250> let<00:02:58.490> go<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.940> was<00:02:59.030> throw

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
throw it and let go and it was throw

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.910 
throw it and let go and it was throw
exactly<00:02:59.630> where<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> pointed<00:03:00.140> out<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.800> is

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
exactly where you pointed out this is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.180 
exactly where you pointed out this is
the<00:03:00.980> same<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:01.340> resistance<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:02.830> knife<00:03:03.830> this

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
the same as resistance to knife this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.880 
the same as resistance to knife this
seems<00:03:04.459> kind<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.790> new<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.090> knife<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.620> to

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
seems kind of new to knife you have to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.880 
seems kind of new to knife you have to
tap<00:03:07.190> anywhere<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> screen<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:09.320> doesn't

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
tap anywhere on the screen that doesn't

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.680 
tap anywhere on the screen that doesn't
have<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.280> control<00:03:10.670> assigned<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.480> any

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
have a control assigned to it so any

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.840 
have a control assigned to it so any
clear<00:03:12.020> space<00:03:12.290> on<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.500> screen<00:03:12.770> will<00:03:13.459> allow<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
clear space on the screen will allow you

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.030 
clear space on the screen will allow you
to<00:03:14.000> knife<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.140> seems<00:03:15.470> pretty<00:03:15.680> cool<00:03:15.860> we'll

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
to knife so that seems pretty cool we'll

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.430 
to knife so that seems pretty cool we'll
hope<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.250> see<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.600> being<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.870> quick<00:03:18.200> way<00:03:18.410> to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
hope to see that being a quick way to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.850 
hope to see that being a quick way to
knife<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.959> way<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.140> activate<00:03:21.500> kill

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
knife and the way to activate kill

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.320 
knife and the way to activate kill
streaks<00:03:22.130> there'll<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.550> icon<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.300> bottom

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
streaks there'll be a icon on the bottom

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.720 
streaks there'll be a icon on the bottom
left<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.050> tap<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.040> I'll<00:03:25.190> activate<00:03:25.489> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
left you tap that and I'll activate the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.940 
left you tap that and I'll activate the
kill<00:03:25.910> streak<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:27.110> touch<00:03:27.350> exactly

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
kill streak and you can touch exactly

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.009 
kill streak and you can touch exactly
where<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.459> want<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.820> place<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.660> kill<00:03:29.810> streak

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
where you want to place the kill streak

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.750 
where you want to place the kill streak
like<00:03:30.230> an<00:03:30.440> airstrike<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.550> touch

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
like an airstrike and you just touch

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.720 
like an airstrike and you just touch
exactly<00:03:32.209> where<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.480> want<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:33.190> place<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.519> so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
exactly where you want to place it so

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.130 
exactly where you want to place it so
that<00:03:34.760> seems<00:03:35.180> pretty<00:03:35.330> cool<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.080> think

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
that seems pretty cool so I think

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.350 
that seems pretty cool so I think
nihilistic<00:03:36.769> I've<00:03:36.920> done<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> good<00:03:37.370> job<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:38.030> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
nihilistic I've done a good job with the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.990 
nihilistic I've done a good job with the
controls<00:03:38.840> but<00:03:39.170> not<00:03:39.620> not<00:03:40.220> much<00:03:40.459> with<00:03:40.820> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
controls but not not much with the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.430 
controls but not not much with the
graphics<00:03:41.480> because<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.750> graphics<00:03:42.110> don't<00:03:42.290> look

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440
