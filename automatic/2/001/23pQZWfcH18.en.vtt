better version you don't have a my
camera<00:00:16.710> but<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> problem<00:00:17.730> was<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
camera but was the problem was with the

camera but was the problem was with the
first<00:00:18.300> one<00:00:18.449> was<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> arms<00:00:19.859> was

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
first one was like one of the arms was

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.439 
first one was like one of the arms was
stuck<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.400> place<00:00:20.640> or<00:00:20.820> was<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.970> spring-loaded

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
stuck in place or was a spring-loaded

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
stuck in place or was a spring-loaded
arm<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.900> something<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:22.710> took<00:00:23.070> away<00:00:23.279> from

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
arm or something it just took away from

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.429 
arm or something it just took away from
the<00:00:23.519> figure<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> whole<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.230> none<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the figure a whole lot this has none of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.470 
the figure a whole lot this has none of
that<00:00:25.529> simple<00:00:26.490> figure<00:00:26.760> with<00:00:26.910> articulation

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that simple figure with articulation

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
that simple figure with articulation
good<00:00:28.289> detail<00:00:28.710> good<00:00:28.949> design

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
good detail good design

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.709 
good detail good design
I<00:00:29.640> enjoyed<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:31.170> comparing<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.719> which

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
I enjoyed now comparing them to which

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
I enjoyed now comparing them to which
one<00:00:33.870> should<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.079> use<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> enuf<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> mark<00:00:35.250> 6<00:00:35.550> here

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
one should I use is enuf the mark 6 here

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
one should I use is enuf the mark 6 here
comparing<00:00:36.690> them<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.530> pretty

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
comparing them to that it's it's pretty

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.880 
comparing them to that it's it's pretty
much<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.100> scale<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.700> would<00:00:39.329> assume<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
much in scale I would assume so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
much in scale I would assume so
I<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.309> ironmongers<00:00:42.030> much<00:00:42.239> bigger<00:00:42.480> than<00:00:42.629> Iron

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
I know ironmongers much bigger than Iron

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.130 
I know ironmongers much bigger than Iron
Man<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.360> good<00:00:45.480> they<00:00:45.570> made<00:00:45.750> he's<00:00:45.960> like

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Man so it's good they made he's like

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
Man so it's good they made he's like
what<00:00:46.500> four<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> half<00:00:47.010> inches<00:00:47.460> maybe<00:00:47.730> just

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
what four and a half inches maybe just

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
what four and a half inches maybe just
four<00:00:48.420> inches<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.930> he's<00:00:49.079> much

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
four inches I don't know he's much

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
four inches I don't know he's much
bigger<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.550> other<00:00:50.670> toys<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> his

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
bigger than the other toys so so his

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.510 
bigger than the other toys so so his
merit<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.320> his<00:00:55.530> main<00:00:55.680> color<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.270> gray<00:00:58.520> silver

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
merit or his main color is gray silver

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.820 
merit or his main color is gray silver
and<00:01:00.829> blue<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.769> pretty<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:06.799> not<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and blue so that's pretty much it not a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.260 
and blue so that's pretty much it not a
whole<00:01:07.890> lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> color<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> guy<00:01:11.270> his

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
whole lot of color on this guy his

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.200 
whole lot of color on this guy his
articulation<00:01:12.570> let's<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.470> huh<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.210> couldn't

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
articulation let's go huh I couldn't

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.789 
articulation let's go huh I couldn't
think<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.840> next<00:01:15.869> anyway<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
think of what to do next anyway is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
think of what to do next anyway is
articulation<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.420> around<00:01:18.689> with

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.399 
hand articulation and go side to side -
they're<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:38.970> good<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.930> can't<00:01:40.170> look<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
they're so pretty good you can't look up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.399 
they're so pretty good you can't look up
or<00:01:40.590> down<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.090> legs<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.200> same

all<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> other<00:01:46.020> figures<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.189> stuck<00:01:47.579> on

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
all the other figures do this stuck on

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.109 
all the other figures do this stuck on
the<00:01:47.850> ball<00:01:48.030> joint<00:01:49.460> I'm<00:01:50.460> pretty<00:01:50.729> sure<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:50.939> can

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the ball joint I'm pretty sure they can

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.560 
the ball joint I'm pretty sure they can
move<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:53.009> down<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.149> everyone's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.289 
going to giving me like the advice of
putting<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.610> hot<00:01:56.759> water<00:01:57.860> I'll<00:01:58.860> try<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
putting them in hot water I'll try that

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
putting them in hot water I'll try that
but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> don't<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.170> we'll<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:04.579> the
