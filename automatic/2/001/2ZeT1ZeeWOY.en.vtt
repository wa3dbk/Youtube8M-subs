00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.600 

it<00:00:26.200> just<00:00:26.500> keeps<00:00:26.680> on<00:00:26.830> going<00:00:28.290> so<00:00:29.290> this<00:00:30.280> one<00:00:30.490> it

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
it just keeps on going so this one it

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.650 
it just keeps on going so this one it
might<00:00:30.790> seem<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.240> little<00:00:31.330> bit<00:00:31.480> complicated

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
might seem a little bit complicated

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.090 
might seem a little bit complicated
because<00:00:32.050> there's<00:00:32.260> a<00:00:32.320> lot<00:00:32.440> of<00:00:32.560> movement<00:00:32.800> in<00:00:32.980> the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
because there's a lot of movement in the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.170 
because there's a lot of movement in the
fingers<00:00:33.250> but<00:00:33.580> it's<00:00:33.700> actually<00:00:33.940> one<00:00:34.060> of<00:00:34.090> the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
fingers but it's actually one of the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.490 
fingers but it's actually one of the
easier<00:00:34.450> tutorials<00:00:34.900> we've<00:00:35.050> done<00:00:35.200> it's<00:00:35.470> just

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
easier tutorials we've done it's just

easier tutorials we've done it's just
that<00:00:35.710> it's<00:00:35.830> going<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.010> take<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.190> bit<00:00:36.370> longer<00:00:36.400> to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670

and<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:36.950> can<00:06:37.130> I<00:06:37.880> guess<00:06:38.600> like<00:06:38.810> lick<00:06:39.200> it<00:06:39.350> a<00:06:39.410> bit

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
and you can I guess like lick it a bit

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.530 
and you can I guess like lick it a bit
more<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.070> make<00:06:40.940> a<00:06:40.970> sound

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
more and make a sound

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:57.179 
more and make a sound
just<00:06:41.840> experiment

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.409 

so<00:06:58.189> yeah<00:06:58.339> that's<00:06:58.549> basically<00:06:58.669> it<00:06:59.029> I'm<00:06:59.269> gonna

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
so yeah that's basically it I'm gonna

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.809 
so yeah that's basically it I'm gonna
play<00:06:59.569> it<00:06:59.659> one<00:06:59.779> more<00:06:59.929> time<00:07:00.079> slowly<00:07:00.469> and<00:07:00.819> we'll

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
play it one more time slowly and we'll

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:21.320 
play it one more time slowly and we'll
call<00:07:01.969> it<00:07:02.119> that

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.439 

there<00:07:22.330> we<00:07:22.479> go<00:07:23.340> hope<00:07:24.340> that<00:07:24.490> one's<00:07:24.639> easy<00:07:24.909> enough

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449 
there we go hope that one's easy enough

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.659 
there we go hope that one's easy enough
to<00:07:25.509> follow<00:07:25.900> if<00:07:26.590> it's<00:07:26.710> not<00:07:26.860> comment<00:07:27.310> up<00:07:27.460> and

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:27.669 
to follow if it's not comment up and

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:29.730 
to follow if it's not comment up and
I'll<00:07:27.789> do<00:07:27.939> one<00:07:28.749> that's<00:07:29.020> maybe<00:07:29.229> a<00:07:29.379> little<00:07:29.560> bit

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
I'll do one that's maybe a little bit

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.059 
I'll do one that's maybe a little bit
slower<00:07:30.689> but<00:07:31.689> once<00:07:31.870> again<00:07:32.139> if<00:07:32.319> you<00:07:32.469> just<00:07:32.889> watch

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:33.069 
slower but once again if you just watch

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.070 
slower but once again if you just watch
a<00:07:33.159> tutorial<00:07:33.340> a<00:07:33.669> few<00:07:33.879> times<00:07:34.150> and<00:07:34.449> just<00:07:34.840> mess

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
a tutorial a few times and just mess

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.790 
a tutorial a few times and just mess
around<00:07:35.110> with<00:07:35.469> it

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
around with it

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.700 
around with it
and<00:07:36.599> try<00:07:37.599> not<00:07:37.749> to<00:07:37.810> focus<00:07:38.169> on<00:07:38.289> how<00:07:38.439> much<00:07:38.620> stuff

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
and try not to focus on how much stuff

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.080 
and try not to focus on how much stuff
is<00:07:38.949> going<00:07:39.219> on<00:07:39.340> it's<00:07:39.520> actually<00:07:39.819> one<00:07:39.939> of<00:07:39.969> the

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
is going on it's actually one of the

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.089 
is going on it's actually one of the
