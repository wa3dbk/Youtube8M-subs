had<00:01:51.630> waitresses<00:01:52.290> coming<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> us<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
had waitresses coming up to us and I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.410 
had waitresses coming up to us and I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
guess we are louder than expected so so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999
