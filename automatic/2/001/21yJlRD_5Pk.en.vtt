00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
 For this you need a pair of scissors 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.009

 i have mine from ebay then you need 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.019
 another rubber band that you can 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 also order in e mail or in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.690
 buy this must on everyone 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.780
 case the ba and in addition i can 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 you recommend such small beads caps 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 to get 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.239
 you put that from both sides on the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.670
 on it and make it very much 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.430
 You have started to make chic by giving her 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.199
 measure the length of the rubber band 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 For this you just take the end of your 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 rubber bandes and wrap it once 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.829
 generously around your wrist or around 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 Its wrist for the bracelet 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.280
 should be 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.880
 leave enough space at the end with it 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.369
 to make a good closure yet 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 can and now you just download that 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.009
 and now you start by putting it on 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.970
 one side a few knots 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 on top of each other makes load there but 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.439
 also between knots and ends too 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 there must be enough space for so many 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.720
 knots are stacked up 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.850
 the hole of the pearl no longer about it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.860
 fits and you the pearls undisturbed 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 can thread on that would have to suffice 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.630
 and now it works as well 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.829
 thread them just look for the beads 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.170
 from thieves wants to use and threads 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:01.320
 this one in a row on one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.060
 Pull through the hole to the back here 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.439
 Be careful with the rear 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.079
 small not all fall out again 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.640
 and that just makes it so long now 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350
 it 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 Wrist fits and enough beads 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.260
 are threaded so I'm done now 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.910
 cancel the beads 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.640
 As you can see I always have two 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.550
 light blue beads then took one 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.709
 cap threaded a gray pearl and 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 again a cap so that the gray 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.740
 Pearl is always enclosed by the kapo 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 and now you just knot it all 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.290
 firmly 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.130
 that means you pull the knot up 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.580
 the pearls touch and make 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.410
 about 12 knots and nice that 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.320
 rubber when tightening but not too 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.330
 dolle so it should not travel but 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.790
 be pretty tight the knot that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 There is no room for movement between the beads 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.070
 so and now you pull the beads on 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.500
 knot a bit and cut 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.570
 him about remaining over the rest 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.150
 rubber band from read to knot about 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.160
 still 12 millimeters square from 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.769
 rubber band that you do not knot 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:24.640
 breaks cuts and then you're done 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.640
 and looks beautiful
