00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.010
 here you have three versions of the hairstyle 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:14.030
 that we're going to make the queue loose a 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.510
 collected sign or all collected 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 let's start first doing the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 lace braid 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.420
 for this zig zag do 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.300
 repeat on one side 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 and for now we are going to leave all the rest 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.210
 separated 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.350
 with a line to the side we start by catching 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.350
 a section 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.260
 we divide in two equal parts 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.700
 and we are going to go twisting the two 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.900
 strands towards the same side 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.990
 and then we twist them to the sense 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.170
 contrary to what we are turning each 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.170
 lock 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.400
 we roll them 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.300
 and how is a cord braid 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 root 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 Now we have to add to each 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.100
 tuft its corresponding part so 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.360
 we take a small section 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.229
 we attach it to that first strand and we return 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.909
 to twist in the same direction to join 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.270
 both 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.109
 and on the other side 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.570
 let's do the same thing take another 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:55.180
 section 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.990
 to join it to this other lock 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.800
 and to join them again we twist in 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.800
 the same sense 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.540
 once they are both twisted 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.490
 we cross again in the direction 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.280
 contrary to what we are twisting 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.430
 individually 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.560
 that way you will not undo the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.040
 cord 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.680
 and we go back to take a part we unite 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 to the tuft that is more to the right and what 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.220
 we twist 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.330
 and we take another lock that is going to 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:49.310
 correspond to the next lock 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.530
 we join it and we twist it again 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.270
 once they are both twisted 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.140
 we turn them twisting in the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.770
 Wrong Way 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.630
 and so we are going to do 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.920
 all that section that we had left 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.920
 separated on the side 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.299
 remember whenever each strand of hair 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:28.319
 they have to go the 2 rotated in the same 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:32.060
 sense and to twist the two turn 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.060
 we have in the opposite direction 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.659
 that we no longer have strands to add 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.190
 we finished the cord in the same way 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.340
 that we have started 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.530
 we take the rest you could take the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.500
 loose hair 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.750
 the cord on the side but in this 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.260
 case let's make a pigtail and the rubber 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.110
 we're going to cover it with the short 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.260
 we could leave the pigtail with the hair 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.920
 as is, but in this case, I wanted 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.600
 undulate it a little bit 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.930
 you can do it with custard plates 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.500
 and you can leave the cord braid with 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.760
 the canceled ponyta take a little bit to 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 give a little volume 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.110
 and if we can not go taking sections and 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.240
 rolling over the pigtail of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.020
 this way the hair will be shorter 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.020
 in the ponytail 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.700
 and this would be the result 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.890
 and if you prefer as collected whole 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.380
 just catch the hair that is left 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:11.510
 loose and roll it up and it would stay like that 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.510
 I hope you liked it until soon
