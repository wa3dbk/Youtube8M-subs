00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
checking the water inlet valve and this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.030 
checking the water inlet valve and this
is<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> Kenmore<00:00:09.059> style<00:00:09.599> washer<00:00:10.260> very<00:00:10.559> similar

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
is a Kenmore style washer very similar

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.940 
is a Kenmore style washer very similar
to<00:00:11.250> any<00:00:11.400> whirlpool<00:00:12.210> style<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.650> we're<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
to any whirlpool style so we're going to

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.010 
to any whirlpool style so we're going to
need<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> disassemble<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.330> water

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
balance on the back here but you need to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.560 
balance on the back here but you need to
take<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.080> apart<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.740> able<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> get<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.570> the

here this is where your hot and your
cold<00:00:33.899> water<00:00:34.790> hooks<00:00:35.790> up<00:00:36.469> here's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> little

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
cold water hooks up here's a little

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.720 
cold water hooks up here's a little
solenoids<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.700> open<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:40.140> called<00:00:40.440> four<00:00:40.770> so

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
solenoids that open one called four so

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.860 
solenoids that open one called four so
the<00:00:41.820> first<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> want<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.690> before

you take this thing out is you want to
check<00:00:44.520> there's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> couple<00:00:45.120> screens<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.870> here

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
check there's a couple screens in here

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.299 
check there's a couple screens in here
you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.270> pop<00:00:48.270> these<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.260> screwdriver

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.020 

want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> check<00:00:53.730> these<00:00:53.940> screens<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.840> sediment

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
want to check these screens for sediment

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.470 
want to check these screens for sediment
and<00:00:57.350> actually<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.420> if

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and actually I can see I don't know if

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
and actually I can see I don't know if
you<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> video<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you can see this in the video that this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.050 
you can see this in the video that this
one<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.379> plugged<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
one is all plugged up and this was in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
one is all plugged up and this was in
the<00:01:06.090> cold<00:01:06.360> water<00:01:06.720> side<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> probably

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the cold water side so this is probably

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.250 
the cold water side so this is probably
the<00:01:08.939> reason<00:01:09.270> why<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.570> weren't<00:01:09.720> getting<00:01:10.110> any

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the reason why we weren't getting any

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.960 
the reason why we weren't getting any
cold<00:01:10.619> water<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> take

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
cold water so we're just going to take

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
cold water so we're just going to take
these<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.260> kitchen<00:01:13.470> sink<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.100> going

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
these into our kitchen sink we're going

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.710 
these into our kitchen sink we're going
to<00:01:14.280> rinse<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.760> we're<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> put

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to rinse them out we're going to put

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.700 
to rinse them out we're going to put
them<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.290> through<00:01:16.979> any<00:01:17.070> holes<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.729> here

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
them back in through any holes in here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.399 
them back in through any holes in here
you<00:01:19.710> would<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> replace<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.700> screens

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
you would want to replace these screens

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.710 
you would want to replace these screens
you<00:01:22.409> also<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> check<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.369> hoses<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you also want to check your hoses that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
you also want to check your hoses that
connect<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.409> sometimes<00:01:26.369> their<00:01:26.580> screens<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
connect here sometimes their screens and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
connect here sometimes their screens and
those<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.990> screens<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> both<00:01:28.710> ends

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
those it could be screens on both ends

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679 
those it could be screens on both ends
of<00:01:29.189> those<00:01:29.369> hoses<00:01:29.610> too<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> check

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
of those hoses too so you want to check

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
of those hoses too so you want to check
both<00:01:30.930> ends<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.829> before<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:34.920> put<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
both ends to them and before we put this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.649 
both ends to them and before we put this
back<00:01:35.430> together<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.909> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> make<00:01:36.270> sure<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
back together we want to make sure that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
back together we want to make sure that
those<00:01:36.930> solenoids<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.740> working<00:01:38.130> good<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
those solenoids are working good so

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.480 
those solenoids are working good so
we're<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.869> our<00:01:40.049> own<00:01:40.290> meter<00:01:40.650> I'm

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
we're not get out our own meter I'm

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
we're not get out our own meter I'm
going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> set<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.030> ohms<00:01:42.799> we've<00:01:43.799> already

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
going to set it to ohms we've already

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.190 
going to set it to ohms we've already
looked<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> service<00:01:45.570> manual<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
looked this up in the service manual to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
looked this up in the service manual to
see<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.590> reading<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.460> should<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.119> this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
see what reading we should have on this

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.740 
see what reading we should have on this
valve<00:01:48.570> these<00:01:49.470> solenoids<00:01:49.890> should<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.750> one
