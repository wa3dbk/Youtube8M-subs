always<00:03:22.080> work<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.950> better<00:03:23.190> solution<00:03:23.910> here<00:03:24.270> is

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
always work the better solution here is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.980 
always work the better solution here is

give you more height and make the loose
top<00:03:30.840> work<00:03:31.220> but<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.430> let's<00:03:32.730> put<00:03:33.000> her<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.390> a
