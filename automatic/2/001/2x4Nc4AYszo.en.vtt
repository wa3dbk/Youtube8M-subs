00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
up all this dirt so looks like it's a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.340 
up all this dirt so looks like it's a
natural<00:03:24.060> formation<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.180> no<00:03:27.810> smart

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
natural formation so that no smart

natural formation so that no smart
creatures<00:03:28.620> will<00:03:29.070> come<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.730> don't<00:03:32.910> know

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
creatures will come in and I don't know

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.160 
creatures will come in and I don't know
if<00:03:33.060> there's<00:03:33.210> going<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.450> dragons<00:03:33.900> or<00:03:34.020> not

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
if there's going to be dragons or not

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.280 
if there's going to be dragons or not
because<00:03:36.320> that's<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:38.190> gonna<00:03:39.000> suck<00:03:39.750> real<00:03:40.050> bad

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
because that's just gonna suck real bad

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.260 
because that's just gonna suck real bad
because<00:03:40.800> then<00:03:41.100> they'll<00:03:41.370> pipe<00:03:41.610> breathe<00:03:41.970> fire

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
because then they'll pipe breathe fire

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.320 
because then they'll pipe breathe fire
and<00:03:42.690> burn<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.590> my<00:03:43.950> down<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:44.460> I<00:03:45.860> hope<00:03:46.860> my
