00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.150 
all of the airbox and everything's still
in<00:02:04.220> there<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:05.599> compressor<00:02:06.349> and<00:02:06.649> all<00:02:06.979> that

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
in there the compressor and all that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160 
in there the compressor and all that
under<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.520> hood<00:02:07.550> condenser<00:02:08.509> those<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:08.990> not

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
under the hood condenser those are not

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.199 
under the hood condenser those are not
there<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.009> wanted<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.340> put<00:02:10.520> AC<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.030> this

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
there so if you wanted to put AC in this

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.410 
there so if you wanted to put AC in this
those<00:02:11.480> would<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.900> be<00:02:12.020> replaced<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:14.240> heat

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
those would have to be replaced the heat

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.479 
those would have to be replaced the heat
does<00:02:14.660> work<00:02:14.900> under<00:02:15.290> sent<00:02:15.530> heat<00:02:16.040> works<00:02:16.220> I've

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
does work under sent heat works I've

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.000 
does work under sent heat works I've
used<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.230> here's<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> headliner<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.860> was

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
used it here's the headliner I was

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.620 
used it here's the headliner I was
telling<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.459> it's<00:02:20.000> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.209> falling<00:02:20.510> off

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
telling you it's kind of falling off

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990 
telling you it's kind of falling off
over<00:02:20.989> time<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.470> got<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.739> board<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.790> new

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
over time so you got the board so a new

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.400 
over time so you got the board so a new
headliner<00:02:23.390> would<00:02:23.599> need<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.959> rolled<00:02:24.230> in

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
headliner would need to be rolled in

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.559 
headliner would need to be rolled in
here<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.400> right<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.910> explain<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.540> me

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
here this right here you explain to me

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.540 
here this right here you explain to me
you<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.020> need<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.349> drop<00:02:27.590> undo<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
you just need to drop undo all the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.120 
you just need to drop undo all the
screws<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.239> drops<00:02:29.540> down<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.800> roll<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
screws this drops down you roll the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.870 
screws this drops down you roll the
liner<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.489> it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
liner on it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.400 
liner on it
and<00:02:32.209> then<00:02:32.330> put<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.599> right<00:02:32.690> back<00:02:32.870> up<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.170> it

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
and then put it right back up so it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.720 
and then put it right back up so it
doesn't<00:02:33.650> sound<00:02:33.739> hard<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.489> want<00:02:34.550> to

climb<00:02:48.200> back<00:02:48.470> here<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:49.730> seat<00:02:50.030> can<00:02:50.060> come<00:02:50.450> all

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
climb back here this seat can come all

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.229 
climb back here this seat can come all
the<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:50.900> out<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:52.280> use<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.640> whole<00:02:52.879> area

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
back here for storage but there's a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.360 
back here for storage but there's a
switch<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.599> back<00:02:56.750> side<00:02:57.140> over<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.530> that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
switch on the back side over here that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.430 
switch on the back side over here that
folds<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:58.970> down<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.569> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.870> take<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.230> whole

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
thing out as you see there's the spare

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.100 
thing out as you see there's the spare
tire<00:03:03.140> back<00:03:03.170> in<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.709> back<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:05.420> window<00:03:05.870> does

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
tire back in the back that window does

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.900 
tire back in the back that window does
come<00:03:06.379> down<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.950> way<00:03:07.129> you<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:07.459> lower<00:03:07.700> that

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
come down all the way you can lower that

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.229 
come down all the way you can lower that
from<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.180> front<00:03:08.450> you've<00:03:08.720> got<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> switch

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
from the front you've got to switch

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.680 
from the front you've got to switch
right<00:03:11.239> up<00:03:11.390> here<00:03:11.569> on<00:03:11.659> the<00:03:11.750> dash

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
right up here on the dash

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.340 
right up here on the dash
so<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.990> will<00:03:13.170> raise<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.860> lower<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:15.350> all
