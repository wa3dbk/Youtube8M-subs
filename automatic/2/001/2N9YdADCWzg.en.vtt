talking about his arsenal vs swansea as

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.390 
talking about his arsenal vs swansea as
if<00:02:52.050> this<00:02:52.170> wasn't<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> weirdest<00:02:52.920> football

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
if this wasn't the weirdest football

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
if this wasn't the weirdest football
season<00:02:53.730> I've<00:02:53.820> ever<00:02:53.850> seen<00:02:54.239> before<00:02:54.420> because<00:02:54.840> 1z

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
season I've ever seen before because 1z

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.810 
season I've ever seen before because 1z
do<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.470> pretty<00:02:55.560> decent<00:02:56.040> team<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.760> they

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
do have a pretty decent team but they

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
do have a pretty decent team but they
still<00:02:56.970> shouldn't<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.239> being<00:02:57.480> Arsenal

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
still shouldn't be being Arsenal

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
still shouldn't be being Arsenal
obviously<00:02:58.400> 61<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.670> was<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> disgrace

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
obviously 61 that was a disgrace

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.060 
obviously 61 that was a disgrace
probably<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> most<00:03:01.200> surprising<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.739> all<00:03:01.860> is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
probably the most surprising of all is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.220 
probably the most surprising of all is
Tottenham<00:03:02.700> being<00:03:02.910> third<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> league<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
Tottenham being third in the league is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.080 
Tottenham being third in the league is
like<00:03:04.590> I've<00:03:04.800> died<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.250> gone<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.489> hell<00:03:05.850> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
like I've died and gone to hell the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.340 
like I've died and gone to hell the
earlier<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> season<00:03:06.989> they<00:03:07.080> were<00:03:07.170> playing

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
earlier on the season they were playing

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.600 
earlier on the season they were playing
in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.530> Europa<00:03:08.040> League<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.310> then<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.489> got

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
in the Europa League and then they got

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.770 
in the Europa League and then they got
knocked<00:03:08.820> out<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.209> wouldn't<00:03:09.420> really<00:03:09.540> give<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
knocked out you wouldn't really give a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.630 
knocked out you wouldn't really give a
team<00:03:10.050> with<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.800> kind<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.040> prospects<00:03:11.459> much

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
team with that kind of prospects much

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.740 
team with that kind of prospects much
chance<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> Premier<00:03:12.360> League<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.600> then

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
chance in the Premier League and then

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.780 
chance in the Premier League and then
somehow<00:03:13.080> somehow<00:03:13.709> they<00:03:14.160> are<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.430> third<00:03:14.760> place

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
somehow somehow they are in third place

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.360 
somehow somehow they are in third place
in<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.330> title<00:03:15.959> race<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.680> they<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.040> in<00:03:17.280> the
