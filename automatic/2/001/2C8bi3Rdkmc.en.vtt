00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.140
 today navarrete fails and is complicated 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.480
 when the goalkeeper fails or fails 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.009
 we have a water captain and a defense 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.009
 plastic is the only thing 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.530
 that undoubtedly angel cost you 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.130
 the test exit america not what 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.130
 we can deny is the trigger 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.250
 sorry to have said it 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.790
 I do not really regret it because 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.620
 maybe you can come to think or 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.739
 manifest that that was the exit of the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.350
 america but it was not so much like that 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.840
 that was already looking for a year ago 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.260
 a year and a half ago they treated you badly 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.580
 for nothing, never, never, I have a lot 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 honey for the america a lot 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.559
 thanks to all the people who 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 they work there I want them I have contact 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.360
 with them and there's more to thank 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.630
 angel because he declares this fact that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 plead good because at that moment 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.520
 the responsibilities that are taken 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.420
 inside the court had not been the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 correct by team leaders 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.870
 then there had already been some 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:20.220
 previous occasions in which there were 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.190
 past the same and more unjust 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.870
 look guilty and in this case new 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.240
 net 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.790
 Carlos when you play in a team like 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 the america and you throw yourself a statement of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.450
 these 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.450
 you shoot a foot 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.640
 but not because you play in America that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 offers but increases the responsibility 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.240
 when in america and more 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.420
 America is what I told him I understand 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.509
 your courage 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.229
 of the winning guy of a guy who talks about 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.580
 front but many times we are going to 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.189
 laugh and say them 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.270
 If something is looking for or we are looking for now 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.270
 you are the means is this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.450
 that in the long run you 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 it does not suit you I do not know I do not think 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.709
 either that it is a trigger for 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.209
 that he would have left America but if 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.910
 it was the best one called attention and 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.700
 talk to him 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.640
 I insist on something he has too much 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.610
 football 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.380
 and I understand his character but with the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.950
 football is enough to show who is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.480
 who miss the American girl 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.690
 really good 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.870
 pointing out what Carlos says also 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.760
 I after the statement should I 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.740
 thanks in this case to the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.550
 president in turn at that time to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.760
 michel bauer knows that he was at 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.620
 technician alfredo tena because really not 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.250
 there was so much that problem because of 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 statement they simply like as 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.350
 he said it was a wake-up call and I 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.930
 I was going to continue as if nothing was happening in 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.290
 america but had searched for a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.019
 opportunity to leave the club to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.550
 for my projection as a footballer but 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.290
 because this one especially in america was 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.440
 a reference is a very important type 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.630
 double because we had already agreed 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.960
 if you can call it that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.870
 decades and a half ago if you wanted 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.650
 say I wanted to look for the projection 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.260
 as long as there was good 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.170
 opportunity and at that moment the most 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.780
 convenient was to go to Monterrey then 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.520
 that's why the decision was made 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.590
 not everyone behaves the same was to try 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.370
 alfredo tena and careful to have 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.900
 technician alfredo tena is but it is heavy 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.490
 because where do I get myself also Mr. 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.480
 he does not want it 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.840
 because he seems like a good guy who manages 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 straight 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.240
 thanks for that I say that I think 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.510
 but I want a nation to the image if I 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.000
 you allow and the difference between what 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.290
 I'm technician, you did not have it, you have it, 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.690
 Juan Antonio, who has known him for a long time 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.760
 time and chepo what differences there are 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.030
 between the three 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:37.220
 all three are professionals and what 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:37.220
 it's about that the name does not 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.750
 I made my debut condemned and said I left 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.990
 america i'm going on vacation saying 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.420
 they told me that I had left 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.540
 I left America and on the phone 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.650
 they said until I started laughing I did not 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.570
 are you kidding 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.430
 if you are now when I left when 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.590
 appeared necaxa one day that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.720
 you found nothing because they told him 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.490
 I was saying that he sees me and gives me 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.220
 he went and told me in a hotel in the lobby of 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.620
 a hotel that you left for me but never 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.870
 never that that speaks in front of that 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.770
 If he has a bad face, it's a great 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.070
 leader and great partner of mine taught me 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.900
 very much but when it touched me here you do not 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.540
 touches you and behaved head on 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.090
 with you 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.090
 I think that if I do not have any doubt 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660
 I 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.990
 respect start with it breathe
