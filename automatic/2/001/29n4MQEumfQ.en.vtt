rail<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.280> now<00:01:05.330> next<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> minecart<00:01:07.470> go

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
rail so now next to the minecart go

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
rail so now next to the minecart go
three<00:01:08.369> blocks<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:10.020> whatever<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.979> want
