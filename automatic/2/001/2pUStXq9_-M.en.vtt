we are we're trying to get a scale right
for<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.280> PDR<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.790> minimum<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.109> we're<00:03:37.260> moving

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
for the PDR a minimum so we're moving

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.660 
for the PDR a minimum so we're moving
some<00:03:37.620> weight<00:03:37.829> around<00:03:37.980> which<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> see

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
some weight around which you want to see

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.880 
some weight around which you want to see
we're<00:03:38.910> at<00:03:39.000> after<00:03:39.269> we<00:03:39.359> got<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:39.870> changes<00:03:40.290> had

so<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.350> know<00:04:16.470> we<00:04:16.560> did<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.889> bit<00:04:17.010> of

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
so you know we did a little bit of

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.740 
so you know we did a little bit of
testing<00:04:17.400> through<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.609> winter<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.120> we<00:04:18.539> really

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
testing through the winter but we really

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.089 
testing through the winter but we really
didn't<00:04:18.930> make<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.080> lot<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.320> changes<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:19.979> those

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
didn't make a lot of changes for those

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.800 
didn't make a lot of changes for those
tests<00:04:20.700> we<00:04:20.940> kind<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.239> just<00:04:21.359> went<00:04:21.510> out<00:04:21.599> there

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
tests we kind of just went out there

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.110 
tests we kind of just went out there
with<00:04:21.930> our<00:04:22.080> normal<00:04:22.260> program<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:23.760> tried<00:04:23.970> some

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
with our normal program we tried some

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.750 
with our normal program we tried some
gear<00:04:24.330> ratio

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
gear ratio

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.070 
gear ratio
the<00:04:24.970> last<00:04:25.180> race<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.720> weren't<00:04:25.960> real

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
the last race and weren't real

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.690 
the last race and weren't real
successful<00:04:26.680> with<00:04:26.800> them<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:27.100> one<00:04:27.220> go<00:04:27.340> back<00:04:27.520> to

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
successful with them so one go back to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.240 
successful with them so one go back to
what<00:04:27.820> we<00:04:27.940> know<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:29.260> think<00:04:29.800> this<00:04:30.010> year

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
what we know I think this year

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.770 
what we know I think this year
everybody's<00:04:30.640> gonna<00:04:30.760> go<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> little<00:04:31.090> bit<00:04:31.240> faster

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
everybody's gonna go a little bit faster

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.320 
everybody's gonna go a little bit faster
you<00:04:32.740> know<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.220> think<00:04:33.520> we<00:04:33.760> have<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.940> ability<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
you know I think we have the ability to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.820 
you know I think we have the ability to
run<00:04:34.510> with<00:04:34.720> everybody<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.230> just<00:04:35.530> think<00:04:35.710> we've

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
run with everybody I just think we've

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.110 
run with everybody I just think we've
been<00:04:35.950> missing<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.370> little<00:04:36.580> bit<00:04:36.670> on<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.880> setup

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
been missing a little bit on the setup
