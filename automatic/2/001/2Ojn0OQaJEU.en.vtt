more natural looking and as you can see

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.970 
more natural looking and as you can see
right<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.290> does<00:00:43.469> look<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.829> bit

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
right now it does look a little bit

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
right now it does look a little bit
darker<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.850> did<00:00:45.390> put<00:00:45.690> quite<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> good

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
darker because I did put quite a good

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
darker because I did put quite a good
amount<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.829> coconut<00:00:47.309> oil<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
amount of coconut oil in it and as you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080 
amount of coconut oil in it and as you
can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.579> looks<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.910> bit

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
can see that it still looks a little bit

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.799 
can see that it still looks a little bit
curly<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.879> reason<00:00:53.879> being<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
curly the reason being is because I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689 
curly the reason being is because I
haven't<00:00:55.320> strained<00:00:55.710> my<00:00:55.829> hair<00:00:56.039> since<00:00:56.250> Sunday

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
haven't strained my hair since Sunday

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.150 
haven't strained my hair since Sunday
night<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
night so the reason I do that is just a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
night so the reason I do that is just a
personal<00:00:59.550> preference<00:00:59.850> only<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.410> don't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
personal preference only because I don't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
personal preference only because I don't
like<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.129> apply<00:01:02.460> heat<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> my<00:01:03.180> hair<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.660> often<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
like to apply heat to my hair as often I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.480
