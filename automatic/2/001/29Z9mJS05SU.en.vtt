00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 brown is still a genus or of Antillean orchids of which 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 There are six species in the world 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.140
 in Cuba there are three of them 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.090
 really very striking and they have the most distribution 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 restricted is a unit product cubensis 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.370
 It is especially clear that this procedure leads to the conviction that Cubans 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.600
 by provinci 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.010
 all what I say 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.690
 the rubén miño 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 roll for that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 the orchids constitute a family with more than 25 thousand species in Cuba 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 there are more than three hundred native species each subject 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600
 to very specific environmental conditions 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.210
 it happens that the year 1984 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 almost simultaneously 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 I get 2012 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.980
 from the north ages one 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.980
 everything is well connected some identity 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.890
 in the guanahacabibes peninsula 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 but the environment exposes that mentally 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.899
 they call him the president of the activity society 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.119
 The association of amateur botany of Cuba 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.329
 our desire is to say 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.289
 and he tells me that he had a copy in his house 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.079
 that had flowered 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.129
 and they throw different has competed who knows 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.159
 instead of with a great effort of his life 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.249
 you find the area where you are 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.249
 we saw for the first time the good bag 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:46.049
 after several decades without news of its existence it begins to rebound if 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.119
 well the presentation of a very difficult tunnel 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.209
 however, reports like the one on the hill of coca 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.129
 very soon a divan 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.129
 then news 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.749
 there you have 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.549
 part of the story stressed that they 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.120
 they were in this trunk that has given good but is totally burned 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.189
 were taken when to employ unemployment many remained in this area 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.789
 then the fire came that three days 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.119
 we can not say it but it was 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.119
 really a casual fire 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.809
 again the trail of brun tony apuril was lost 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.149
 but nevertheless 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.149
 there were those who did not desist in their search 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.939
 in the inter ecology 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.389
 of that way of execution envisaged by the fact that reliability 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.849
 epiphyte plants live on the trunks of trees 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.079
 wrongly this way of life is interpreted as a case of parasitism 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.949
 but unlike a parasite they do not take the nutrients from these 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:04.819
 if not 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.819
 of the surrounding medium 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.340
 in the year 2000 before the evil the biology student follows the trail 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.479
 for now or crisis 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.840
 in the place where it is a last sighting 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 the hill of purchase 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.960
 the pta plant the obvious train car 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.210
 they had drowned 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.050
 despite the security plan this year only one individual a flower 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.050
 the reproduction of orchids begin with pollination 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.789
 which consists in the transport of pollen to the stigma of the flower 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.490
 which requires pollinating agents mostly insects is thus 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.360
 say it 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.469
 some rules
