00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.340
 even 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.209
 the most ordinary white shirt next 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.769

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.019

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.310

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.760

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.210

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.910
 only yellow wanted something very 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.800

 cap but in fact they are very bright 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.570
 very spring I will combine with 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.860
 dresses and pants because it is 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.449

 saying he just adores this dress this 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.020
 his favorite dress and so I decided 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.720
 what exactly should it be in this video 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.130
 This dress is from Valentine's brand she 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.889
 completely simple 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.139

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.199
 back see here goes here such 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.470
 bow and neckline on me 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.180
 really looks very nice 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.050
 know plenty of yourself 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:45.590
 godkov so 5 in this board is very beautiful 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.410
 bright positive and why am I waiting for summer 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.150
 to put it on green again I 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.889
 I'll show you my favorite pencil 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.580
 for eyes which 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.479
 called 24 on 7 my alpensia 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.090
 in shades of coffee and this is a pencil impeller 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.889
 who are just legendary on my channel 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.289
 everyone already knows that my favorite 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.879
 sales for the eyes and I adore erect 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:13.189
 the lower water line of the eye lashes 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.830
 look it is very spring very 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.240
 bright very beautifully highlights you 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.879
 and it does not seem such a shade 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.370
 will emphasize any color of eyes as she 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.629
 really made a very unusual 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.159
 I recommend everyone to try this 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:28.009
 pencil because he really 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:31.099
 very persistent, he keeps in the morning you put or render 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:34.099
 and then in the evening without any problems do not need 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.939
 our letting lead like that here's my 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.219
 green 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:39.379
 favorite and here competitors were 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.020
 a bit so my choice was pretty 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.699
 quickly the only competitor to what 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.029
 I'll show you now this green one 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:50.120
 vase but in general it stands in the background 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:52.189
 so you see her from green I 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.389
 I chose this perfume dolce in the parfa mind 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:56.419
 gabbana dolce 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.180
 I really love him very much to me 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.020
 reminds our wedding I was with this 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.460
 perfume 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.169
 and that's when I listen to him like that 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.129
 you know 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:12.020
 pleasant memories some emotions 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:15.080
 so I do not know what he is 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.020
 light greenish color allowed me 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.180
 refer it to this tag 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.460
 but really just for them connected 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.899
 too much all 4 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.899
 look further rooted
