and that's pretty much it so here's the
power<00:02:25.600> brick<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.980> interesting<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:29.170> like

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
power brick it's interesting it's like

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.699 
power brick it's interesting it's like
it's<00:02:29.560> separated<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.270> box<00:02:31.510> from<00:02:32.200> the

it's separated out of the box from the
actual<00:02:33.220> plug<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:33.880> kind<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.450> put<00:02:34.810> those

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
look at this just like a piece of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020

camera and your flash you have this

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.360 
camera and your flash you have this
little<00:03:52.150> rubber<00:03:52.450> filling<00:03:53.440> texture<00:03:54.130> it's

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
little rubber filling texture it's

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.150 
little rubber filling texture it's
interesting<00:03:54.640> texture<00:03:55.209> sort<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.930> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
interesting texture sort of like the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.370 
interesting texture sort of like the
Nexus<00:03:57.160> 7<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.579> texture<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.720> have<00:03:58.840> speakers<00:03:59.200> on

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
Nexus 7 and texture you have speakers on

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.990 
Nexus 7 and texture you have speakers on
the<00:03:59.500> side<00:03:59.680> which<00:03:59.890> is<00:04:00.010> pretty<00:04:00.280> innovative<00:04:00.610> I

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
the side which is pretty innovative I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.060 
the side which is pretty innovative I
have<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.329> say<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.720> stereo<00:04:02.440> speakers<00:04:02.860> I'm

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
have to say that stereo speakers I'm

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.110 
have to say that stereo speakers I'm
sure<00:04:03.220> their<00:04:03.340> speakers<00:04:03.610> would<00:04:03.700> be<00:04:03.820> better<00:04:04.000> than

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
sure their speakers would be better than

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.720 
sure their speakers would be better than
the<00:04:04.299> ipad<00:04:04.630> hopefully<00:04:05.130> those<00:04:06.130> speakers<00:04:06.340> face

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
the ipad hopefully those speakers face

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.160 
the ipad hopefully those speakers face
the<00:04:06.940> rear<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.329> device<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.019> have<00:04:08.140> a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
the rear of the device and you have a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.340 
the rear of the device and you have a
little<00:04:08.350> guess<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.100> little<00:04:09.340> charging<00:04:10.079> place<00:04:11.079> for

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
little guess a little charging place for

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.380 
little guess a little charging place for
a<00:04:11.380> doc<00:04:11.709> potentially<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.850> then<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.030> have<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
a doc potentially and then you have the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.550 
a doc potentially and then you have the
volume<00:04:13.989> rocker<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:16.019> microUSB<00:04:17.019> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
volume rocker and the microUSB the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.949 
volume rocker and the microUSB the
headphone<00:04:18.220> jack<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:19.060> looks<00:04:19.239> like<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.390> hdmi

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
headphone jack and it looks like a hdmi

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.800 
headphone jack and it looks like a hdmi
mini<00:04:20.200> port<00:04:20.590> or<00:04:20.769> micro<00:04:21.130> HDMI<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.539> course<00:04:22.660> I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
mini port or micro HDMI so of course I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.719 
mini port or micro HDMI so of course I
didn't<00:04:23.020> go<00:04:23.110> into<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.500> reviewed<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.640> know

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
didn't go into this reviewed you know

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.790 
didn't go into this reviewed you know
expecting<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.479> device<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.930> fill<00:04:26.110> as<00:04:26.260> solid<00:04:26.680> as

the IP

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.040 
the IP
I knew<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.640> wouldn't<00:04:27.940> fill<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.210> solid<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:28.900> it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
I knew it wouldn't fill is solid and it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.170 
I knew it wouldn't fill is solid and it
would<00:04:29.170> be<00:04:29.290> made<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.770> plastic<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:31.000> really

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
would be made of plastic and it really

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.640 
would be made of plastic and it really
does<00:04:31.420> you<00:04:31.660> mean<00:04:31.810> you<00:04:31.900> feel<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.230> difference

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
does you mean you feel the difference

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.040 
does you mean you feel the difference
definitely<00:04:33.520> from<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.390> beginning<00:04:34.480> I<00:04:34.870> mean

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
definitely from the beginning I mean

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.690 
definitely from the beginning I mean
it's<00:04:35.290> kind<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.650> creaky<00:04:36.370> like<00:04:36.550> if<00:04:36.640> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
it's kind of like creaky like if you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.130 
it's kind of like creaky like if you
press<00:04:37.000> too<00:04:37.210> hard<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.540> can<00:04:37.660> hear<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:37.990> moving

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
press too hard you can hear it moving

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.190 
press too hard you can hear it moving
and<00:04:38.890> cracking<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.520> don't<00:04:39.970> really<00:04:40.090> like<00:04:40.450> that

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
and cracking I don't really like that

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.440 
and cracking I don't really like that
too<00:04:41.410> much<00:04:41.440> but<00:04:41.980> you<00:04:42.730> know<00:04:42.850> what<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.240> know<00:04:43.360> what
