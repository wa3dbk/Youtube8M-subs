 Hello dear people, how are you. Welcome to My Virgin Kitchen. Chloe is here today 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.700
 sit by, say hello? Hey! So, Chloe is there and we will go soon 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.410
 Get Phoebe from school, right? -but just before she left school, I have ginger 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.910
 cookies made. Do you know what they are? Yes? She is a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.320
 a bit shy because she has never been here and she fears that there are a lot of people here. They are alone 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 the two of us, okay? Okay, gimme five! Ginger cookies are nostalgic cookies, Chloe, 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 ok, when I was younger and growing up, of course I was younger when I was growing up 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 ginger cookies a very nostalgic cookie and if you had red hair, do you have red hair? 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.530
 No, you don't! If you had red hair it became gingerbread 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.250
 your nickname, but anyway, they are super simple to make and if you want to try the recipe, 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.250
 then pause the video when Chloe claps her hands. 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:10.869
 So now the ingredients are on the screen and that's how you make ginger cookies. 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.869
 We start by preheating the oven at 190ÂºC. OK? -yes, thanks Chloe. 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.260
 During the warming up you take a large bowl, where all the ingredients will be added 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.040
 come together, starting with the self-rising flour and ginger powder. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.170
 Of course you can adjust the amount of ginger to taste. Everything OK? 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 What is going on? I'm not shy at all. Well, the next ingredient is sodium bicarbonate, after which 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.049
 you mix it all for the first time and for some reason I caught my nose 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.259
 and I got a little animated while I did that, sorry! Agreement? 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.329
 Good. You can already guess the next ingredient 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.329
 what it was Chloe? Sugar, right, high five! She was not even there and still knew 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:21.010
 that I had added sugar. I did it with schwung and did not look at the bowl, but do not imitate it 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.980
 because I almost missed the bowl. Stir well, catalog position is 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.829
 optional. At the recording I skipped a step, you leave 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.829
 butter in the bowl and crumble with your hands in the dry mixture. 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.010
 Next are two tablespoons, what is this Chloe? -yes, I asked you what it was! 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:00.359
 two tablespoons of corn syrup, so. Mix it with a spoon and it will 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:10.949
 put dough together. Knead it into a sticky bulb. 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.319
 Once I had my ginger dough ball, it was just a matter of smaller ones 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.379
 to distribute balls. Of the total amount, I managed 18 ginger cookies 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.209
 to make. Roll small balls and place them per 9, well spread, on a baking sheet. 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.109
 Because you will see that they get bigger in the oven. 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.659
 Bake them for about 12-15 minutes until they are nicely golden brown and then leave them 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:40.659
 cool and become crispy. That was it than people, here's your cookie. 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.870
 and I also take one. [untranslatable sentence] 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.870
 They taste absolutely phenomenal, just real. 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.609
 Did you like it? Yes it tastes great and they look fantastic. 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:10.869
 They also smell very nice, the smell of ginger is in the kitchen. Better than the paint smell earlier! 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 Also view these two videos. Say I love you. I love you! See you next time!
