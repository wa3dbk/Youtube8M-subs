00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
so it can't wear off as far as how that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.970 
so it can't wear off as far as how that
affects<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> touch<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.350> ball<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.739> wet

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.040 
affects the touch on the ball in wet
weather<00:03:05.180> essentially<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.630> does<00:03:06.780> is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
weather essentially all that it does is

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.979 
weather essentially all that it does is
it<00:03:07.140> seems<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.680> kind<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.040> wick<00:03:08.280> away<00:03:08.459> water<00:03:08.989> if

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
it seems to kind of wick away water if

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.540 
it seems to kind of wick away water if
you<00:03:10.290> notice<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.800> ever<00:03:10.950> worn<00:03:11.100> playing<00:03:11.430> in

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the wet weather you notice that there's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.199 
the wet weather you notice that there's

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
bit more than it would in dry conditions

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.350 
bit more than it would in dry conditions
on<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.890> ACC<00:03:29.370> model<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.760> outside<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.269> the

a<00:03:32.459> little<00:03:32.580> bit<00:03:32.760> drier<00:03:33.030> than<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.450> would<00:03:33.600> without

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
a little bit drier than it would without

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.650 
a little bit drier than it would without

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
the ACC upper and that is kind of what

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.699 
the ACC upper and that is kind of what
allows<00:03:39.570> for<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.080> bit<00:03:40.170> better<00:03:40.290> friction

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
allows for a little bit better friction

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.259 
allows for a little bit better friction
between<00:03:40.860> your<00:03:41.100> foot<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> ball<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.850> that's

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
between your foot in the ball and that's

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.820 
between your foot in the ball and that's
really<00:03:42.420> all<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.959> does<00:03:43.080> is<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.769> a

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
really all that it does is it a

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.560 
really all that it does is it a
noticeable<00:03:44.190> difference<00:03:44.340> yes<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.420> it

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
noticeable difference yes is it

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.670 
noticeable difference yes is it
something<00:03:45.720> that's<00:03:45.900> gonna<00:03:46.080> allow<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.530> have

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
something that's gonna allow you to have

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.070 
something that's gonna allow you to have
much<00:03:47.100> better<00:03:47.130> control<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.820> wet<00:03:48.120> weather<00:03:48.180> not

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
much better control in wet weather not

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.720 
much better control in wet weather not
necessarily<00:03:49.799> your<00:03:49.950> touch<00:03:50.100> on<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.340> ball<00:03:50.489> is

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
necessarily your touch on the ball is

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.840 
necessarily your touch on the ball is
still<00:03:51.000> gonna<00:03:51.209> be<00:03:51.620> pretty<00:03:52.620> well<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.100> same<00:03:53.340> it's

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
still gonna be pretty well the same it's

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.280 
still gonna be pretty well the same it's
just<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.060> little<00:03:54.420> bit<00:03:54.510> easier<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.930> guess<00:03:55.170> you

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
just a little bit easier I guess you

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.009 
just a little bit easier I guess you
could<00:03:55.440> say<00:03:56.209> slightly<00:03:57.209> less<00:03:57.420> slick<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
could say slightly less slick on the

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.590 
could say slightly less slick on the
ball<00:03:58.350> that's<00:03:58.590> pretty<00:03:58.799> much<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.360> but<00:04:00.360> other

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
ball that's pretty much it but other

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.640 
ball that's pretty much it but other
than<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> only

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
than that that's really the only

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
than that that's really the only
difference<00:04:01.920> as<00:04:02.340> far<00:04:02.370> as<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.670> fit<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.000> feel<00:04:03.180> of

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
difference as far as the fit and feel of

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.729 
difference as far as the fit and feel of
these<00:04:03.480> shoes<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.200> pretty<00:04:04.410> much<00:04:04.530> identical

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
these shoes it's pretty much identical

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.520 
these shoes it's pretty much identical
unless<00:04:05.489> you're<00:04:05.640> playing<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.239> wet<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:07.019> do<00:04:07.500> i

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
unless you're playing in the wet so do i

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.670 
unless you're playing in the wet so do i
what<00:04:07.830> i<00:04:07.860> do<00:04:08.130> i<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> acc<00:04:08.910> version<00:04:09.269> better

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
what i do i like the acc version better

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
what i do i like the acc version better
absolutely<00:04:10.680> i<00:04:10.709> think<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.610> nice

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
absolutely i think it's a it's a nice

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.430 
absolutely i think it's a it's a nice
inclusion<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.360> have<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.720> ACC<00:04:13.230> technology

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
inclusion to have that ACC technology

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.560 
inclusion to have that ACC technology
into<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> shoe<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.880> does<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> make<00:04:15.269> or<00:04:15.480> break

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
into the shoe but does it make or break

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.840 
into the shoe but does it make or break
the<00:04:15.750> hue<00:04:15.959> if<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.169> have<00:04:16.320> an<00:04:16.440> older<00:04:16.650> model

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
the hue if you have an older model

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.130 
the hue if you have an older model
should<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.970> really<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.299> disappointed<00:04:18.540> you

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
should you really be disappointed you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.529 
should you really be disappointed you

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
you be upgrading to the ACC model not

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
you have you're not really missing out

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.210 
you have you're not really missing out
on<00:04:24.720> too

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220

much<00:04:25.370> other<00:04:26.090> than<00:04:26.120> that<00:04:26.300> guys<00:04:26.480> that's<00:04:26.720> pretty

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
much other than that guys that's pretty
