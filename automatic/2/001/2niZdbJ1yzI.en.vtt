00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
water in you can put ice in very easily

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
water in you can put ice in very easily
and<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.750> easily<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.320> your<00:00:28.439> hand<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
there to clean it out so you won't get

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
there to clean it out so you won't get
horrible<00:00:30.179> diseases<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.529> cleaning<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
horrible diseases from not cleaning a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
horrible diseases from not cleaning a
water<00:00:32.040> bottle<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> being<00:00:32.610> lazy<00:00:32.820> next<00:00:33.630> also

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
water bottle and being lazy next also

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.330 
water bottle and being lazy next also
like<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.290> said<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> boat's<00:00:34.829> crew<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.130> tops

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
like we said with a boat's crew on tops

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
like we said with a boat's crew on tops
of<00:00:35.489> course<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> easy<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.420> well

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of course that makes it easy as well

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
of course that makes it easy as well
they<00:00:37.290> also<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.559> large<00:00:37.770> valve<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.370> when

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
they also have large valve so when

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
they also have large valve so when
you're<00:00:38.790> spraying<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> water<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.899> it's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you're spraying all that water in it's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
you're spraying all that water in it's
easier<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> get<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.100> you're<00:00:41.219> not<00:00:41.340> gonna

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
easier to get in and you're not gonna

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.920 
easier to get in and you're not gonna
have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> suck<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
have to suck on it it's going to be a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
have to suck on it it's going to be a
lot<00:00:43.079> faster<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.559> finally<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.920> course<00:00:44.160> these

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
lot faster and finally of course these

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
lot faster and finally of course these
are<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.610> bpa-free<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.570> means<00:00:45.780> no<00:00:46.140> horrible

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
are all bpa-free that means no horrible

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.279 
are all bpa-free that means no horrible
diseases<00:00:46.920> no<00:00:47.579> cancer<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:48.750> no<00:00:49.110> whatever

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
diseases no cancer or no whatever

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
diseases no cancer or no whatever
happens<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.340> drink<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:51.180> BPA<00:00:51.719> filled

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
happens when you drink from BPA filled

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
happens when you drink from BPA filled
water<00:00:52.500> bottle<00:00:52.800> anyway<00:00:53.070> never<00:00:53.250> mind<00:00:53.329> let's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
water bottle anyway never mind let's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.610 
water bottle anyway never mind let's
move<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> Nathan<00:00:55.079> first<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
move on to the Nathan first of all this

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
move on to the Nathan first of all this
is<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.010> simple<00:00:56.399> water<00:00:56.640> bottle<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is a very simple water bottle it's a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
is a very simple water bottle it's a
double<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.230> got<00:00:58.590> double<00:00:58.859> wall<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
double it's got double wall so it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.610 
double it's got double wall so it's
going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> keep<00:00:59.730> your<00:01:00.289> drinks<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.440> bit

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
going to keep your drinks a little bit

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910 
going to keep your drinks a little bit
cooler<00:01:02.070> than<00:01:02.340> normal<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.840> se<00:01:04.350> cool<00:01:04.650> as

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
cooler than normal but not as se cool as

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
cooler than normal but not as se cool as
the<00:01:05.129> elite<00:01:05.369> which<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the elite which is going to have a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300 
the elite which is going to have a
better<00:01:07.020> insulation<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.979> course<00:01:08.189> has

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
better insulation because of course has

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.359 
better insulation because of course has
got<00:01:08.430> gel<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.930> Nathan<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.560> 600

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
got gel in it so the Nathan it's 600

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:11.899 
got gel in it so the Nathan it's 600
mils

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
mils

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.880 
mils
so<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.479> got<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> good<00:01:12.780> capacity<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
so it's got a good capacity to it it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679 
so it's got a good capacity to it it
doesn't<00:01:14.250> lose<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> capacity<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> elite

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
doesn't lose the capacity like the elite

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
doesn't lose the capacity like the elite
does<00:01:15.900> elite<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> course<00:01:16.710> only<00:01:17.340> holds<00:01:17.640> about

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
does elite of course only holds about

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.749 
does elite of course only holds about
500<00:01:18.090> mils<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.840> water<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.680> whatever<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.670> if

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
500 mils of water or whatever what if

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
500 mils of water or whatever what if
you're<00:01:20.850> drinking<00:01:21.030> hot<00:01:21.420> toddy<00:01:21.689> perhaps<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you're drinking hot toddy perhaps on a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.820 
you're drinking hot toddy perhaps on a
nice<00:01:22.470> cold<00:01:22.799> winter<00:01:23.130> day<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.470> reason<00:01:25.740> it's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
nice cold winter day so the reason it's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
nice cold winter day so the reason it's
got<00:01:25.979> less<00:01:26.250> capacity<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> got

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
got less capacity is because it's got

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
got less capacity is because it's got
thicker<00:01:27.869> insulation<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> keep
