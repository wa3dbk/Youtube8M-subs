00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello friends how are we today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.990
 cooking a delicious octopus of a 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.419
 way in one of many ways to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.989
 cook what is left soft and not 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:18.570
 it is taffy to be able to cut it with 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:22.189
 ease 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 It is as can the squishy as 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:30.240
 must be if you like to accompany me to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.740
 prepare it let's start with 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.190
 our ingredients that here already 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 we have organized put in a pot 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 big enough that we put 4 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.570
 liters of water to boil we have the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.510
 boiling water now here we are going to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 put the other seasonings we are going to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.290
 put two bay leaves that to give him 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.510
 taste and it also takes away that 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:01.690
 taste and smell of octopus forgiveness I put 2 o 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.600
 2 cloves of garlic also do not know well but 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.050
 I put 2 cloves of garlic now I'm going to 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.030
 put a piece of onion then yours 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.340
 white or purple 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.119
 we are also going to put two nails and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.119
 two peppers 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 and two tablespoons of vinegar 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.509
 Apple 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 now yes it is already boiling well 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.820
 let's go with the octopus is that we're going to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.130
 scare is a technique that's how you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.220
 call here we have an octopus of three 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.329
 pounds or one of three pounds or one kilo and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.890
 medium 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.880
 it's already clean, we have to make sure 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.299
 wash well and we will immerse the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.299
 Water 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.460
 this is going to help 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.710
 we submerged a little and we took this out 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.480
 will help the fibers get cut and 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 so we will not stay chewy or hard 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.590
 we leave a little bit to return the water to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.590
 break a little on the edge 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.319
 and we submerge it again 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.840
 we take them out this we're going to do three or 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.709
 four times here we are going to do three 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.709
 times and then we will leave 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 here on the third time we skipped 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.360
 we let the water boil again 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.990
 little and we put it back now yes 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.840
 let's let it break the boil either 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.120
 High you not have to be very high 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 temperature but yes, but yes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.430
 is boiling once so here's what 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 we cover for that we are a big pot 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.980
 so that you do not throw away the water that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.250
 the water is about halfway through the pot 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.050
 here I repeat are 4 liters of water now 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.050
 Once a boil and can 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:01.620
 take the time we will leave it 45 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.290
 minutes and we're going to take it out of the fire and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.930
 we 're going to try it with a toothpick 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.760
 it is soft and it has 45 minutes shadow 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.730
 we go with a toothpick and it is already soft 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.160
 but anyway we take it out of the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.350
 fire or put out the fire and we 're going to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.670
 leave covered covered by 10 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.390
 more minutes and you 're done 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.370
 blandito our octopus is the same if 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.160
 you think you have to be more 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.239
 Squishy leaves it a little longer 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.020
 boiled nothing happens and in the moment 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.770
 that has to be 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.730
 As you need it, I recommend that you 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.710
 the blame is previously frozen already 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.020
 when it buys it frozen it becomes the same 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.050
 clean and you buy it fresh ask that what 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.320
 clean up there and freeze it a couple of days 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.970
 and then freeze that helps it to be 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.180
 softest now here I recommend them 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.490
 that the part that is between the head and 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.890
 the tentacles is like this do not use it is 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.020
 too hard in any way 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.090
 Sant will now be able to do 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.150
 so this is already ready and nothing 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.140
 more he cuts it and uses it for any 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.480
 recipe that asks for cooked octopus this as 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.270
 you can see we did not put it on it does not take salt 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.280
 here because you can do that too 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.140
 for harder the cider makes it 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.480
 harder is that you put salt and 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.900
 pepper already when you are going to consume it 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.730
 It depends on the recipe you are going to use 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.670
 thank you very much for having seen this 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.670
 video and see you in the next video
