00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
about that and I started off using the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.640 
about that and I started off using the
scorpion<00:00:29.400> evo<00:00:29.820> along<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> silencer<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
scorpion evo along with the silencer and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
scorpion evo along with the silencer and
the<00:00:32.040> grip<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.579> believe<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the grip I believe is what I'm using in

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.830 
the grip I believe is what I'm using in
this<00:00:33.719> game<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.070> grip<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.360> grip<00:00:36.570> makes

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this game and the grip is the grip makes

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.170 
this game and the grip is the grip makes
the<00:00:37.079> scorpion<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:37.739> opinion<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.670> starts<00:00:39.059> off

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the scorpion in my opinion it starts off

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
the scorpion in my opinion it starts off
as<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> good<00:00:39.899> close<00:00:40.260> range<00:00:40.530> gun<00:00:40.739> without<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
as a good close range gun without the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830 
as a good close range gun without the
grip<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> put<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> grip<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
grip but when you put the grip on it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.319 
grip but when you put the grip on it
actually<00:00:43.200> makes<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.010> really

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
actually makes it really really

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.610 
actually makes it really really
effective<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.719> viable<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.379> those

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
effective and really viable at those

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
effective and really viable at those
medium<00:00:47.100> ranges<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
medium ranges so you know you really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
medium ranges so you know you really
want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> avoid<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:49.980> long

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
want to avoid going into long long

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
want to avoid going into long long
engagements<00:00:51.539> long<00:00:51.660> battles<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> that's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
engagements long battles with it that's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.529 
engagements long battles with it that's
why<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> pick<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.250> MK<00:00:53.550> 48<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.239> as<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
why I pick up as MK 48 and as a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
why I pick up as MK 48 and as a
secondary<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.530> how<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.710> using<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
secondary and that's how I'm using it to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
secondary and that's how I'm using it to
pick<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.520> decals<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> wouldn't<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.750> able

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
pick up decals that I wouldn't be able

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
pick up decals that I wouldn't be able
to<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.500> these<00:00:58.649> scorpions<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.309> that's

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to get with these scorpions so that's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
to get with these scorpions so that's
always<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.300> something<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> keep<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
always you know something to keep in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.209 
always you know something to keep in
mind<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.379> always<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> pick<00:01:02.100> up

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
secondary if you can that kind of makes

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
secondary if you can that kind of makes
up<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.070> flaws<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.909> primary<00:01:06.420> weapon

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
up for the flaws in your primary weapon

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.600 
up for the flaws in your primary weapon
so<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> always<00:01:07.650> try<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.369> when

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so that's what I always try to do when

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.609 
so that's what I always try to do when
it's<00:01:08.729> available<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> LMGs<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> usually

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it's available now the LMGs I usually

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.109 
it's available now the LMGs I usually
don't<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.979> picking<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.670> primary

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
don't like picking them up as primary

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.030 
don't like picking them up as primary
just<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.619> slow

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just because they make you so so slow

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.830 
just because they make you so so slow
and<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.270> hard<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> be

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and you know it's really hard to be

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.149 
and you know it's really hard to be
mobile<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.799> brush

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
mobile with them and you know brush

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.380 
mobile with them and you know brush
around<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.549> enemy<00:01:17.790> spawn<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> they're

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
around the enemy spawn and they're

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.999 
around the enemy spawn and they're
pretty<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.630> useless<00:01:19.080> when<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> the

pretty much useless when you are in the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820 
pretty much useless when you are in the
enemy<00:01:20.250> spawn<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.600> can't<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.500> mobile

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
enemy spawn because you can't be mobile

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
enemy spawn because you can't be mobile
with<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.340> can't<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.670> move<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with them so you can't really move and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
with them so you can't really move and
avoid<00:01:25.110> people<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.009> able<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
avoid people like you would be able to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.719 
avoid people like you would be able to
do<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.880> SMG<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> usually<00:01:29.340> find

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
do with an SMG so I like to usually find

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
do with an SMG so I like to usually find
an<00:01:29.909> assault<00:01:30.240> rifle<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
an assault rifle or something or just a

an assault rifle or something or just a
different<00:01:32.070> SMG<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.240> balance

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
different SMG that can kind of balance

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359 
different SMG that can kind of balance
out<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> current<00:01:34.200> sng<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.799> whatever<00:01:35.009> gun<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
around a little just a little boost in

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.840 
around a little just a little boost in
terms<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.530> score<00:01:58.920> will<00:01:59.219> actually<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
terms of your score will actually go a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.819 
terms of your score will actually go a
long<00:02:00.299> long<00:02:00.360> way<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.649> bit

long long way so you know the little bit

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.440 
long long way so you know the little bit
of<00:02:01.920> momentum<00:02:02.040> will<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:02.969> help<00:02:03.180> you
