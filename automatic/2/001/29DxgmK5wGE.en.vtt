00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.930
 hello to all but neither on the grounds and 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.940
 I am the fake fat today at 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.950
 lung in saloon shaped saloon for 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.779
 a video dedicated to the reminder series 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.740
 indeed some trouble does not 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.600
 do not know these techniques at all 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.390
 others use it without necessarily 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.700
 know his real interest or so at 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.870
 moments that are not necessarily 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.240
 judicious so that's why the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.250
 this video 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.350
 what is the main interest of the series 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.050
 reminder to stay a reminder friends 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.739
 first of all it's not a method 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.720
 intensification is a method that 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.480
 will promote recovery 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.590
 indeed one incorporate a few series 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.030
 call back the next day or 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 two days after work 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.110
 of a muscle group will improve its 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.080
 recovery ability of the order of 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.240
 20 to 25% first interest and not 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 least second interest is a re 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.519
 solicitations agree there is a job 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.080
 additional that will reinvigorate the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.689
 nabo the isthmus without hindering 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.490
 its ability to recover well our 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.439
 contracts that we as we come from 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.250
 see it's not going to hinder it 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.570
 improve 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.549
 what does the people ask for amiens 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 really a big icing on the cake 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.370
 so here are the interests of the series of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.960
 reminder so when do you perform them 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.240
 will have understood the series of reminders do not 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.250
 are not performed three 3 days four 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.320
 days five days after his work after 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 the work the work of this group 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 muscular but next day or the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.390
 Two days later 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 after those two days the room could 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.870
 really of interest 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.010
 how to realize these series of reminders 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.530
 first of all things you must choose 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.400
 an isolation exercise and I am 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.720
 Insulation Repeat Why Exercise 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.010
 isolation at his door well this moment the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.780
 friends we want to target only the muscle 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.280
 precisely the chosen muscle in none 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 case we choose to exercise polite 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.080
 articular that would be susceptible 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.240
 to make work muscles attached 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.549
 a very simple example I'm going to do a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.229
 pectorals recall so like game like 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.129
 I say I did internal pectorals 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.840
 said we are Tuesday 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.430
 well i would choose lierse and insulation 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.319
 dismissed the police vis-Ã -vis 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.689
 or then remove them layer 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.430
 dumbbells in any case I will not go 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.389
 to do bench press the developed 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.730
 actually we will solicit 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.889
 my pectorals but also a master's 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.049
 is this world and an interior etc 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:30.829
 we do not want that we really want 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.060
 maximally targeted the muscle chooses so 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.769
 things were going pretty 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.079
 second insulation of things you 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.680
 go realize from one to three series 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:42.439
 maximum and I repeat maximum of 30 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.109
 repeat a mule 30 between each 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.829
 series of rest agreements and a cadence 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.379
 from 1 1 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.900
 a second on the concentrated phase is 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.250
 a second on the eccentric phase 30 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.049
 repetition you'll understand it from 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.169
 years it's a weight that is very very 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.150
 light and careful attention what I 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.949
 mean it's an exercise of a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.189
 exercise which should in no way be 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:07.099
 a job that should not be under any circumstances 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.780
 traumatizing so exit the checks you 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.819
 can not go to failure you 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.079
 must not keep one or two of us from 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.329
 reserve dream before failure 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.159
 it should not be a job 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.040
 traumatic agree we are here 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.959
 only to go for blood 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.090
 congested okay but by no means 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.500
 go to failure if you do that 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.329
 you were going to do all the one towards this is to 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.109
 say you're going to hobble your 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.759
 so quiet recovery ability 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.109
 years we are here really it's punk 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:36.979
 well it's really to bring a 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.560
 maximum 200 in the muscle ok so I 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:40.879
 recapitulates the technique a game I 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.799
 ended that that's the technique she 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.720
 to be academic one enjoy it the hair 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.180
 is very light so ultra technique 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.500
 school we must be able to film and you 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.900
 super use a support 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.599
 in a training center 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.189
 bpjeps for coach so very technical 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.219
 very very academic 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.439
 ok so I summarize the exercise 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.409
 insulation will be carried out from one to three 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.639
 maximum series of 30 repetition a 1030 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.519
 rest between each series 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.620
 the cadence cdu 1 1 and here we are 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.930
 only for congested friends 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.019
 congested at what point of our 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.639
 session will place its series of reminders 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.329
 then you can perform either in 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.560
 beginning of session 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.440
 as a warm up in two 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.320
 except general overall mans here late 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.620
 session as a return to calm two 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.310
 cooldown for the seo to the atom is a 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.830
 little pressure 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.419
 once you have wiped the storm is 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.000
 relax we do our series two 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.990
 reminders nota bene about the fact of them 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.510
 do at the beginning of the session 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.300
 I did say that done at the beginning 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.250
 of sitting that would take place 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.220
 general warm up and I stress 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.110
 on general that does not mean in any way 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.639
 that does not exempt you from 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.560
 specific warm-up for your 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.300
 sitting a very simple example we 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.600
 are on Tuesday I made pectoral the 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.130
 Eve 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620
 so today I decide to make a 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.280
 pectoral booster at the beginning of the session 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.500
 so I 'm coming I'm starting my but 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.630
 dismissed for him I do my three series 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.130
 30 as I wanted to advise that not 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.240
 does not mean that I'm doing 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.410
 so just after that does not mean 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.540
 as far as I go directly 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.490
 leave to the lester pulls or so 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.440
 do my bent heavy bust ruins for 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.740
 friends by no means I repeat it does not 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.610
 must give you a warm up 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.870
 specific that is to say once you 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.910
 did your three sets of reminder 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.950
 she will you still have to realize 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.090
 these three series of warm ups I you 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.890
 have already given in the protocol 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.220
 to warm up before performing your 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.370
 sitting your meeting the moment of agreement 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.410
 so here we go we make a big 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.830
 recap the series of reminders 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.510
 we will improve our recovery we will 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.270
 put a little metabolic boost without 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.070
 to hinder our recovery 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.500
 did the next day or the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.450
 two days after a meeting, we will choose a 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.780
 insulation exercise we will perform a 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.669
 three sets of 30 repetition with one 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.510
 minute thirty rest a second 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.419
 a second 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.760
 and that's only due 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.100
 done without start of session or at the end 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.090
 of sitting so here 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.350
 listen to the reviews this video is 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.340
 finished i hope you liked it 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.770
 I hope you are you were this 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.030
 technique to go extraordinary give
