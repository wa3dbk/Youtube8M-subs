00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
kinds of gameplay are fun but the main

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.140 
kinds of gameplay are fun but the main
one<00:04:49.890> is<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:51.000> best<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.280> gameplay<00:04:53.730> varies

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
one is the best so the gameplay varies

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:03.220 
one is the best so the gameplay varies
but<00:04:54.360> in<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.720> good<00:04:54.900> way

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.250 

on<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.490> original<00:05:04.880> ps2<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.660> graphics<00:05:06.110> look

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
on the original ps2 the graphics look

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.230 
on the original ps2 the graphics look
pretty<00:05:06.560> good<00:05:06.620> for<00:05:06.890> its<00:05:07.520> standards<00:05:08.060> but<00:05:08.180> I

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
pretty good for its standards but I

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.210 
pretty good for its standards but I
highly<00:05:08.600> suggest<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.170> get<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.560> ps3<00:05:09.800> version

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
highly suggest you get the ps3 version

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.370 
highly suggest you get the ps3 version
just<00:05:10.760> because<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.210> looks<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.510> lot<00:05:11.660> better<00:05:11.930> and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
just because it looks a lot better and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.800 
just because it looks a lot better and
cleaner<00:05:12.680> so<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.610> graphics<00:05:14.030> overall<00:05:14.510> on<00:05:14.720> the

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
cleaner so the graphics overall on the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.130 
cleaner so the graphics overall on the
ps2<00:05:15.140> aren't<00:05:15.650> great<00:05:15.920> but<00:05:16.630> ps3<00:05:17.630> one<00:05:17.810> is<00:05:17.990> even

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
ps2 aren't great but ps3 one is even

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:28.630 
ps2 aren't great but ps3 one is even
greater<00:05:26.710> alright<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:27.920> we<00:05:28.010> get<00:05:28.160> to<00:05:28.280> this<00:05:28.430> point

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
greater alright so we get to this point

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.660 
greater alright so we get to this point
of<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.850> video<00:05:29.120> my<00:05:29.450> overall<00:05:29.600> thoughts<00:05:30.670> the
