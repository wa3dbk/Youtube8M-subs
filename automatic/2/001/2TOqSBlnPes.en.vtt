hi<00:00:01.160> guys<00:00:01.400> welcome<00:00:01.729> to<00:00:01.939> Hamish<00:00:02.240> and<00:00:02.390> works.com

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:04.509 
hi guys welcome to Hamish and works.com

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:06.880 
hi guys welcome to Hamish and works.com
let's<00:00:05.509> see<00:00:05.720> how<00:00:05.930> to<00:00:05.990> check<00:00:06.259> the<00:00:06.410> brake<00:00:06.680> oil

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
let's see how to check the brake oil

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.520 
let's see how to check the brake oil
level<00:00:07.160> of<00:00:07.220> your<00:00:07.370> car<00:00:07.960> let's<00:00:08.960> open<00:00:09.200> up<00:00:09.380> the

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
level of your car let's open up the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.339 
level of your car let's open up the
bonnet<00:00:09.830> there<00:00:10.040> is<00:00:10.130> a<00:00:10.160> small<00:00:10.490> lever<00:00:10.940> just<00:00:11.480> push

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
bonnet there is a small lever just push

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:12.610 
bonnet there is a small lever just push
it

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
it

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.520 
it
so<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.309> bonnet<00:00:13.670> will<00:00:13.820> be<00:00:13.940> free<00:00:14.210> now<00:00:14.599> we<00:00:15.380> have<00:00:15.500> a

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
so the bonnet will be free now we have a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.470 
so the bonnet will be free now we have a
small<00:00:15.800> lever<00:00:16.009> between<00:00:16.460> there<00:00:16.670> push<00:00:17.090> that<00:00:17.270> one

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
small lever between there push that one

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.990 
small lever between there push that one
also<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.170> bond<00:00:18.770> will<00:00:19.010> be<00:00:19.160> ready<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.970> open

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
also now the bond will be ready to open

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.769 
also now the bond will be ready to open
so<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:21.590> supporting<00:00:22.039> rod<00:00:22.670> all<00:00:22.850> there<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:23.240> now

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
so the supporting rod all there and now

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.370 
so the supporting rod all there and now
it's<00:00:23.930> open

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
it's open

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.170 
it's open
checking<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.010> brake<00:00:25.250> oil<00:00:25.400> level<00:00:25.730> is<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.850> very

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
checking the brake oil level is a very

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.240 
checking the brake oil level is a very
critical<00:00:26.510> exercise<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:27.470> let's<00:00:27.500> go<00:00:28.039> towards

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
critical exercise so let's go towards

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.670 
critical exercise so let's go towards
the<00:00:28.850> brake<00:00:29.090> master<00:00:29.510> cylinder<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.470> brake

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
the brake master cylinder and the brake

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.219 
the brake master cylinder and the brake
reservoir<00:00:30.859> that's<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.389> reservoir<00:00:32.839> and<00:00:33.109> the

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:33.229 
reservoir that's the reservoir and the

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.099 
reservoir that's the reservoir and the
master<00:00:33.589> cylinder<00:00:33.739> over<00:00:34.069> there<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.780> bottom

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
master cylinder over there so the bottom

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.840 
master cylinder over there so the bottom
we<00:00:36.229> have<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.800> brake<00:00:37.010> master<00:00:37.249> cylinder<00:00:37.760> you

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
we have the brake master cylinder you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.459 
we have the brake master cylinder you
can<00:00:37.969> see<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.239> metal<00:00:38.420> hoses<00:00:38.929> which<00:00:39.079> is<00:00:39.229> leading

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
can see the metal hoses which is leading

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.669 
can see the metal hoses which is leading
to<00:00:39.589> the<00:00:40.149> brakes<00:00:41.149> on<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.690> tires<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.289> those<00:00:42.499> are

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
to the brakes on the tires so those are

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.229 
to the brakes on the tires so those are
the<00:00:42.769> metallosis<00:00:43.129> from<00:00:43.639> the<00:00:43.789> brake<00:00:43.999> master

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the metallosis from the brake master

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.660 
the metallosis from the brake master
cylinder<00:00:44.659> that's<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.049> reservoir<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.039> before

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
cylinder that's a reservoir so before

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.430 
cylinder that's a reservoir so before
opening<00:00:47.030> it<00:00:47.179> up<00:00:47.299> make<00:00:47.569> sure<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.079> clean

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
opening it up make sure that you clean

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.459 
opening it up make sure that you clean
the<00:00:48.469> cap<00:00:49.219> of<00:00:49.459> the<00:00:49.609> reservoir<00:00:49.969> because<00:00:50.469> there

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
the cap of the reservoir because there

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.349 
the cap of the reservoir because there
are<00:00:51.589> dust<00:00:51.769> particles<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:52.459> if<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:52.789> open<00:00:53.269> it

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
are dust particles and if you open it

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.059 
are dust particles and if you open it
without<00:00:53.629> clearing<00:00:54.109> those<00:00:54.289> dust<00:00:54.619> particles

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
without clearing those dust particles

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:57.489 
without clearing those dust particles
will<00:00:55.219> definitely<00:00:55.670> get<00:00:55.850> into<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.809> brake<00:00:57.289> oil

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
will definitely get into the brake oil

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.889 
will definitely get into the brake oil
and<00:00:57.889> contaminate<00:00:58.639> the<00:00:58.789> oil<00:00:59.059> you<00:00:59.569> can<00:00:59.719> see<00:00:59.869> a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
and contaminate the oil you can see a

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:00.849 
and contaminate the oil you can see a
warning<00:01:00.170> over<00:01:00.499> there

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
warning over there

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.399 
warning over there
use<00:01:01.069> only<00:01:01.399> torch<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.179> brake<00:01:02.479> fluid<00:01:02.869> from<00:01:03.289> a

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
use only torch a brake fluid from a

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.529 
use only torch a brake fluid from a
sealed<00:01:03.709> container<00:01:04.000> clean<00:01:05.000> fill<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.329> gap

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
sealed container clean fill the gap

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.459 
sealed container clean fill the gap
before<00:01:05.840> removing<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.399> Bosch<00:01:08.469> master

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
before removing and it's a Bosch master

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.770 
before removing and it's a Bosch master
cylinder<00:01:09.799> over<00:01:09.920> there<00:01:10.219> right<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.390> now<00:01:11.570> let's

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
cylinder over there right so now let's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.630 
cylinder over there right so now let's
see<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.350> brake<00:01:12.619> oil<00:01:12.859> level<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> reservoir

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
see the brake oil level in the reservoir

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.730 
see the brake oil level in the reservoir
and<00:01:14.210> there<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:14.750> adequate<00:01:15.140> amount<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.560> oil

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
and there is adequate amount of oil

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.410 
and there is adequate amount of oil
because<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.399> was<00:01:16.609> talked<00:01:16.939> up<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:17.179> week<00:01:17.390> before

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
because it was talked up a week before

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.630 
because it was talked up a week before
let's<00:01:18.109> touch<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.530> feel<00:01:18.679> how<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:18.859> quality<00:01:19.250> of

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
let's touch and feel how the quality of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.080 
let's touch and feel how the quality of
the<00:01:20.149> oil<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.539> and<00:01:20.899> it's<00:01:21.229> good<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.429> brake<00:01:22.820> oil

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
the oil is and it's good so brake oil

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.730 
the oil is and it's good so brake oil
level<00:01:23.329> is<00:01:23.420> very<00:01:23.719> critical<00:01:23.929> because<00:01:24.229> if<00:01:24.560> there

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
level is very critical because if there

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.800 
level is very critical because if there
is<00:01:24.859> no<00:01:25.039> sufficient<00:01:25.250> brake<00:01:25.700> oil<00:01:25.939> level<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.359> will

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
is no sufficient brake oil level it will

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.200 
is no sufficient brake oil level it will
result<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.320> less<00:01:28.100> efficiency<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.759> braking<00:01:29.179> you

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
result in less efficiency of braking you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.599 
result in less efficiency of braking you
need<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.749> press<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.170> pedal<00:01:30.469> lower<00:01:31.009> down<00:01:31.340> to

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
need to press the pedal lower down to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.959 
need to press the pedal lower down to
create<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.359> draining<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.320> there<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.969> no

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
create a draining if there is a no

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.149 
create a draining if there is a no
sufficient<00:01:35.420> amount<00:01:35.659> of<00:01:35.780> brake<00:01:36.049> oil<00:01:36.289> or<00:01:36.499> if

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
sufficient amount of brake oil or if

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.249 
sufficient amount of brake oil or if
there<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.490> leaks<00:01:37.939> on<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.570> brake<00:01:38.780> oil<00:01:39.020> circuit

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
there is leaks on the brake oil circuit

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.620 
there is leaks on the brake oil circuit
also<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.189> brake<00:01:40.429> oil<00:01:40.609> level<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:41.060> go<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.420> so

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
also the brake oil level can go down so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.779 
also the brake oil level can go down so
it's<00:01:41.810> very<00:01:42.350> important<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.280> check<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.579> brake

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
it's very important to check the brake

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.209 
it's very important to check the brake
oil<00:01:44.030> level<00:01:44.359> weekly<00:01:45.200> enough<00:01:45.409> because<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:46.009> there

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
oil level weekly enough because if there
