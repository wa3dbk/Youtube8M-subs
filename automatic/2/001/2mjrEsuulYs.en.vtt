00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.050 
far as it's a it's like a like they sit
in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> UH<00:02:16.209> what<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.290> call<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.770> man<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.880> of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
in the UH what they call it man the of

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.350 
in the UH what they call it man the of
trailer<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> hybrid<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.850> an<00:02:22.060> assault

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
said isn't look its a mix between the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.770 
said isn't look its a mix between the
salt<00:03:36.239> rifle<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.940> SMG<00:03:38.940> classement<00:03:39.660> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
salt rifle and the SMG classement it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.710 
salt rifle and the SMG classement it
kind<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.019> bridges<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.500> gap<00:03:40.530> between<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.310> two

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
kind of bridges the gap between the two

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.420 
kind of bridges the gap between the two
smaller<00:03:42.720> gun<00:03:43.080> but<00:03:43.319> still<00:03:43.530> has<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.890> range<00:03:44.220> of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
smaller gun but still has that range of
