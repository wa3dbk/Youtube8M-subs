00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.990 

so<00:00:03.740> just<00:00:04.740> got<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> question<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.520> know<00:00:05.759> well

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
so just got a question you know well

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.039 
so just got a question you know well
what<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> heck<00:00:06.420> can<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
what the heck can you do with the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
what the heck can you do with the
digital<00:00:07.440> gauge<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.189> thought<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.730> know<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
digital gauge and I thought you know the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.180 
digital gauge and I thought you know the
best<00:00:09.120> place<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.360> start<00:00:09.660> would<00:00:09.809> just<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.190> by

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
best place to start would just be by

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.830 
best place to start would just be by
walking<00:00:11.550> me<00:00:11.610> through<00:00:11.639> some<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> some<00:00:12.750> of

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
walking me through some of the some of

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.589 
walking me through some of the some of
the<00:00:12.900> basic<00:00:13.259> features<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:14.700> instrument<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the basic features of the instrument and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.540 
the basic features of the instrument and
what<00:00:16.289> we're<00:00:16.410> looking<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.190> a

which pounds per square inch gauge and
then<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.800> battery<00:00:53.489> indicator<00:00:53.910> there

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
then we got our battery indicator there

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.270 
then we got our battery indicator there
as<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.870> scroll<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.530> menus<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.160> we're

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
as I scroll through the menus what we're

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
as I scroll through the menus what we're
going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.840> our

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
going to see here first of all is our

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
going to see here first of all is our
temperatures<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.190> you'll<00:00:59.640> notice<00:00:59.879> there

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
temperatures and you'll notice there

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
temperatures and you'll notice there
really<00:01:00.149> wasn't<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.629> much<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> change<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
really wasn't too much of a change there

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.920 
really wasn't too much of a change there
right<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> measured<00:01:03.359> temperature<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
right the measured temperature and a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.690 
right the measured temperature and a
saturation<00:01:04.530> temperature<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.220> close<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
saturation temperature are very close to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.690 
saturation temperature are very close to
the<00:01:05.790> same<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.840> their<00:01:07.170> systems<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the same because their systems off and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
the same because their systems off and
the<00:01:08.820> refrigerants<00:01:09.750> saturated<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:10.350> means

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the refrigerants saturated which means

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
the refrigerants saturated which means
it's<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> mixture<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> liquid<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.700> vapor<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it's a mixture of liquid and vapor if I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's a mixture of liquid and vapor if I
scroll<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.110> another<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.070> you'll<00:01:14.220> say

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
scroll down another time here you'll say

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.480 
scroll down another time here you'll say
got<00:01:14.580> no<00:01:15.030> sub<00:01:15.330> no<00:01:15.780> superheat<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> two<00:01:17.220> tenths

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
got no sub no superheat and two tenths

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
got no sub no superheat and two tenths
of<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> degree<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.970> sub<00:01:18.299> cooling<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:19.259> that's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
of a degree of sub cooling right that's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.749 
of a degree of sub cooling right that's
more<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:19.950> less<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.159> we're<00:01:20.280> looking<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
more or less what we're looking at is

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.190 
more or less what we're looking at is
the<00:01:20.850> total<00:01:21.150> uncertainty<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> gauge<00:01:21.990> at

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the total uncertainty of the gauge at

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980 
the total uncertainty of the gauge at
this<00:01:22.350> point<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> digital<00:01:24.390> gauge<00:01:24.570> itself

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
this point so the digital gauge itself

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
this point so the digital gauge itself
is<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> making<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> measurement<00:01:27.600> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
is you know the making a measurement of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
is you know the making a measurement of
temperature<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> clamp<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.490> making

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
temperature with a clamp and it's making

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.810 
temperature with a clamp and it's making
a<00:01:29.820> measure<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> pressure<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
a measure of pressure with the with the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.210 
a measure of pressure with the with the
pressure<00:01:33.000> transducers<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.220> it's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
pressure transducers and it's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.399 
pressure transducers and it's
calculating<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.509> actual<00:01:36.930> superheat<00:01:37.380> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
calculating the the actual superheat and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
calculating the the actual superheat and
subcooling<00:01:37.979> right<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
subcooling right at this time so you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.270 
subcooling right at this time so you
know<00:01:39.810> those<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.229> just<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.890> simply

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
know those are just you know simply

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
know those are just you know simply
clamp<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> again<00:01:42.780> everything's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
clamp down here and again everything's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.200 
clamp down here and again everything's
sort<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.950> shut<00:01:44.159> off<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
sort of shut off right now so I just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
sort of shut off right now so I just
wanted<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> walk<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> through<00:01:45.810> through<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
wanted to walk it through through the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.429 
wanted to walk it through through the
basic<00:01:47.130> venues<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:48.000> hit<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.329> again<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.899> now

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
basic venues we hit that again and now

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.960 
basic venues we hit that again and now
we're<00:01:49.590> looking<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:49.970> differential

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
we're looking at differential

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.020 
we're looking at differential
temperature<00:01:51.470> between<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> between<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.000> two

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
temperature between the between the two

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.149 
temperature between the between the two
and<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.049> shooting<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.380> by<00:01:55.590> hand<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.040> an

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and I'm just shooting this by hand on an

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
and I'm just shooting this by hand on an
iPhone<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.869> please<00:01:58.500> excuse<00:01:58.950> the

iPhone so you know please excuse the
unstudied<00:01:59.460> Asst<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> look

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
unstudied Asst now if we take a look

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.280 
unstudied Asst now if we take a look
here<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> instrument<00:02:04.229> we

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
here again at the at the instrument we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
here again at the at the instrument we
hit<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> mode<00:02:04.680> key<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.850> pretty<00:02:06.000> some

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
hit the mode key this is pretty some

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
hit the mode key this is pretty some
pretty<00:02:06.600> slick<00:02:06.780> stuff<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.530> into<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
pretty slick stuff they put into the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.130 
pretty slick stuff they put into the
gauges<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:09.209> now<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:09.629> we're<00:02:09.780> looking<00:02:09.810> at

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
gauges right now what we're looking at

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.890 
gauges right now what we're looking at
is<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.830> timer<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.760> left<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
is a timer on the left and then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.570 
is a timer on the left and then
measured<00:02:13.410> temperature<00:02:13.860> should<00:02:14.430> be<00:02:14.490> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
measured temperature should be a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.980 
measured temperature should be a
measured<00:02:14.880> pressure<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> right

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
measured pressure on the on the right

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.450 
measured pressure on the on the right

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
there at the right hand lower right hand

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.640 
there at the right hand lower right hand
corner<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.840> two<00:02:19.080> hundred<00:02:19.320> sixteen

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.970 
corner and that's two hundred sixteen
point<00:02:19.860> five<00:02:20.010> psi<00:02:20.670> if<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.570> push<00:02:21.840> start<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.620> what

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
point five psi if I push start here what

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.170 
point five psi if I push start here what
you're<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.120> to

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
you're going to see is that's going to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.700 
you're going to see is that's going to
start<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> flash<00:02:24.810> up<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.410> actually

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
start to flash up here and it actually

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.310 
start to flash up here and it actually
recorded<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.880> starting<00:02:27.360> pressure<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.020> what

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
recorded my starting pressure and what

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.770 
recorded my starting pressure and what
it's<00:02:28.470> looking<00:02:28.830> at<00:02:28.950> now<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.460> my<00:02:29.780> starting

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's looking at now is my starting

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.250 
it's looking at now is my starting
pressure<00:02:30.990> my<00:02:32.030> measured<00:02:33.030> pressure<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
pressure my measured pressure and the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.720 
pressure my measured pressure and the
difference<00:02:34.680> between<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.160> starting<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
difference between the starting and the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.150 
difference between the starting and the
measured<00:02:36.000> pressure<00:02:36.210> over<00:02:36.660> time<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:38.070> of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
measured pressure over time and one of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680 
measured pressure over time and one of
the<00:02:38.220> cool<00:02:38.430> things<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.060> thing<00:02:39.300> will<00:02:39.480> do

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the cool things that this thing will do

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.590 
the cool things that this thing will do
is<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.500> uses<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.100> gas<00:02:41.280> loss<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.000> a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
is it uses the gas loss and a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.820 
is it uses the gas loss and a
temperature<00:02:42.960> sensor<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> actually

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
temperature sensor so it actually

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.450 
temperature sensor so it actually
measures<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.740> measures<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
measures the the it measures the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.630 
measures the the it measures the
temperature<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> line<00:02:48.260> measures<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
temperature of the line measures the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.520 
temperature of the line measures the
pressure<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.660> obviously<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.320> is

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
pressure and you know obviously this is

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620 
pressure and you know obviously this is
for<00:02:52.740> 10a<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.580> but<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.180> nitrogen

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
for 10a in here but if this is nitrogen

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
for 10a in here but if this is nitrogen
in<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.080> we'd<00:02:55.650> use<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> pressure

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
in here we'd use the pressure

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.680 
in here we'd use the pressure
temperature<00:02:56.370> relationship<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.210> nitrogen

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
temperature relationship and nitrogen

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930 
temperature relationship and nitrogen
and<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.740> gas<00:02:58.920> laws<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.370> determine<00:02:59.760> if<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
and the gas laws to determine if the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
and the gas laws to determine if the
system<00:03:00.270> was<00:03:00.420> leaking<00:03:00.900> or<00:03:01.290> stable<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.070> really

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
system was leaking or stable so really

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.740 
system was leaking or stable so really
all<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.550> have<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.240> go<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> you

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
all you have to do in this is go to you

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.310 
all you have to do in this is go to you
know<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.870> mode<00:03:04.170> key<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.750> mode<00:03:06.900> key<00:03:07.140> on

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
know the mode key go to the mode key on

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.490 
know the mode key go to the mode key on
this<00:03:07.530> thing<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:09.540> get<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.380> this

this thing to get this to get this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
this thing to get this to get this
started<00:03:10.770> up<00:03:11.010> press<00:03:11.760> Start<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.270> then<00:03:12.750> it's

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
started up press Start and then it's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.870 
started up press Start and then it's
going<00:03:12.990> to<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.260> continue<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.740> flash<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.760> in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
going to just continue to flash that in

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640 
going to just continue to flash that in
a<00:03:14.940> couple<00:03:15.750> seconds<00:03:16.050> here<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.320> should<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.590> a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
a couple seconds here we should get a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.080 
a couple seconds here we should get a
one<00:03:16.920> up<00:03:17.070> there<00:03:17.280> meaning<00:03:17.489> it's<00:03:17.640> gone<00:03:17.820> through

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
one up there meaning it's gone through

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.750 
one up there meaning it's gone through
one<00:03:18.330> minute<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.780> time<00:03:19.170> elapsed<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.640> I'll

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
one minute of time elapsed and then I'll

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.979 
one minute of time elapsed and then I'll
just<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.090> ahead<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.300> stop<00:03:21.540> this

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
just go ahead and stop this

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.320 
just go ahead and stop this
but<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.650> uses<00:03:23.010> Boyle's<00:03:23.640> law<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:24.209> determine

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
but this uses Boyle's law to determine

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.820 
but this uses Boyle's law to determine
that<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.020> there<00:03:25.140> we<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:25.350> there's<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.590> one

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
that and there we go there's the one

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.270 
that and there we go there's the one
right<00:03:26.040> there

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
right there

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
right there
then<00:03:26.760> when<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.910> push<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> stop<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.380> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
then when I push the stop it's going to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.500 
then when I push the stop it's going to
show<00:03:28.590> me<00:03:28.620> my<00:03:28.920> final<00:03:29.160> pressure<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.209> my<00:03:30.300> measure

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
show me my final pressure or my measure

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.110 
show me my final pressure or my measure
temp<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.959> it's<00:03:31.110> in<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.410> drop<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.640> this<00:03:32.910> had

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
temp and it's in a drop now if this had

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670 
temp and it's in a drop now if this had
changed<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.510> temperature<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> had

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
changed the temperature like if it had

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.990 
changed the temperature like if it had
gotten<00:03:34.860> hotter<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.489> should<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.760> also

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
gotten hotter it should have also

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.060 
gotten hotter it should have also
increased<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.510> pressure<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.050> if<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.860> had

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
increased in pressure and if this had

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.199 
increased in pressure and if this had
not<00:03:38.100> changed<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> pressure<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.120> would

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
not changed the pressure it would

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.670 
not changed the pressure it would
actually<00:03:39.570> show<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> leak<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.230> would<00:03:40.320> indicate<00:03:40.530> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
actually show a leak it would indicate a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.979 
actually show a leak it would indicate a
leak<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.100> because<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:42.120> knows<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.390> nitrogen

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
leak here because it knows that nitrogen

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.210 
leak here because it knows that nitrogen
would<00:03:43.230> change<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.650> pressure<00:03:43.860> with<00:03:44.190> a

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
would change in pressure with a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220 
would change in pressure with a
corresponding<00:03:44.850> change<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.239> temperature<00:03:45.660> so

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
corresponding change in temperature so

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.310 
corresponding change in temperature so
that's<00:03:46.640> that's<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.780> basics<00:03:49.200> of

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
that's that's you know the basics of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.560 
that's that's you know the basics of
that<00:03:49.500> one<00:03:49.680> now<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.459> go<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.180> mode<00:03:51.360> key

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
that one now if we go to the mode key

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.100 
that one now if we go to the mode key
again<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.280> our<00:03:53.430> vacuum<00:03:54.120> mode<00:03:54.360> this<00:03:54.989> is

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
again this is our vacuum mode this is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.750 
again this is our vacuum mode this is
more<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> vacuum<00:03:55.890> indicator<00:03:56.370> right<00:03:56.580> now

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
more of a vacuum indicator right now

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.100 
more of a vacuum indicator right now
it's<00:03:57.000> obviously<00:03:57.300> not<00:03:57.480> reading<00:03:57.750> inches<00:03:57.989> of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
it's obviously not reading inches of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.580 
it's obviously not reading inches of
mercury<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.680> reading<00:03:59.750> 216<00:04:00.750> psi<00:04:01.200> because

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
mercury it's reading 216 psi because

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.380 
mercury it's reading 216 psi because
that's<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.890> pressure<00:04:02.100> we<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.310> on<00:04:02.640> here<00:04:02.880> this

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that's the pressure we have on here this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.720 
that's the pressure we have on here this
is<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.630> mode<00:04:04.170> for<00:04:04.200> evacuation<00:04:05.070> it's<00:04:05.250> more<00:04:05.550> of<00:04:05.640> a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
is a mode for evacuation it's more of a

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.490 
is a mode for evacuation it's more of a
roughing<00:04:06.090> gauge<00:04:06.300> than<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> micron<00:04:07.230> gauge

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
roughing gauge than a micron gauge

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.259 
roughing gauge than a micron gauge
because<00:04:07.650> obviously<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.519> doesn't<00:04:08.760> read<00:04:09.030> near

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
because obviously it doesn't read near

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.560 
because obviously it doesn't read near
enough<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.590> micron<00:04:10.950> level<00:04:11.300> and<00:04:12.300> we<00:04:12.390> hit<00:04:12.540> it

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
enough in the micron level and we hit it

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.960 
enough in the micron level and we hit it
again<00:04:12.900> we're<00:04:13.590> back<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.970> differential

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
again we're back to differential

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.020 
again we're back to differential
temperature<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:16.880> differential<00:04:17.880> temperature

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
temperature and differential temperature

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.360 
temperature and differential temperature
and<00:04:18.359> pressure<00:04:18.650> let<00:04:19.650> me<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.980> scroll<00:04:20.310> through

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and pressure let me to scroll through

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.890 
and pressure let me to scroll through
the<00:04:20.549> menu<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.880> that's<00:04:21.030> that's<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.390> basics<00:04:21.810> of

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
the menu so that's that's the basics of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.600 
the menu so that's that's the basics of
a<00:04:21.989> gauge<00:04:22.229> when<00:04:22.800> you're<00:04:22.890> looking<00:04:23.100> at<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
a gauge when you're looking at it you

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.460 
a gauge when you're looking at it you
have<00:04:23.850> nine<00:04:24.360> bunch<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.780> your<00:04:24.960> supp<00:04:25.200> button

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
have nine bunch of your supp button

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.010 
have nine bunch of your supp button
which<00:04:25.590> allows

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
which allows

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.110 
which allows
of<00:04:26.139> changer<00:04:26.590> settings<00:04:27.099> start/stop<00:04:28.090> button

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
of changer settings start/stop button

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.210 
of changer settings start/stop button
and<00:04:28.690> also<00:04:28.960> refrigerant<00:04:29.620> button<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.039> when<00:04:30.190> I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and also refrigerant button so when I

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.339 
and also refrigerant button so when I
hit<00:04:30.400> this<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.539> see<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.780> refrigerant<00:04:32.259> at<00:04:32.319> the

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
hit this you see the refrigerant at the

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.589 
hit this you see the refrigerant at the
top<00:04:32.590> flashing<00:04:33.129> I<00:04:33.280> can<00:04:33.849> change<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.240> up<00:04:34.449> or

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
top flashing I can change this up or

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.149 
top flashing I can change this up or
down<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.960> change<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.379> refrigerant<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.009> hit

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
down to change the refrigerant and hit

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.040 
down to change the refrigerant and hit
refrigerant<00:04:36.610> again<00:04:36.759> to<00:04:36.909> store<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.690> it

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
refrigerant again to store it and it

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.779 
refrigerant again to store it and it
will<00:04:38.139> calculate<00:04:38.379> those<00:04:38.830> corresponding

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
will calculate those corresponding
