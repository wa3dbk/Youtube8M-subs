00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.959
 notch for us 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.000
 inside we see a lot of sim cards 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.990
 in fact they are superimposed in place 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.330

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.690
 so in advance and a battery first 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.690
 match that foreshadows foretelling a 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 rather good autonomy on this type of 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.250

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.600
 I left myself the plastic for 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.690
