00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone with you vova dedsek and today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.250
 would like to show modules to which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.230
 will allow to raise funds 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.269
 automatic protection for your home 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.130
 namely, two types of camera and such 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 robot and in order to take advantage 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 with all these delights you need 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 I put up such a protective station 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.310
 Put the batchat and the future that this 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.770
 here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 plain mood like my home 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.859
 so I put it all and after that to me 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 need to install all this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.080
 equipment that will be useful to me 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.510
 it is two cameras and a robot in differences 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 between the camera and I didn't notice at all 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.829
 except that they have a little responsibility for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.550
 The texture in this lens is black. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.140
 this lens 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 green do not know what the difference 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.190
 Well, actually how to connect them 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.289
 so they start moving and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
 consider everything in the neighborhood since 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.370
 it will be the eyes of our robot we 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.140
 we approach this station we clamp shift 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 press the right mouse button on the bottom 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.600
 parts of this station so far as not this 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.549
 just will not work here after that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 how we clicked should be highlighted here 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.869
 such a date 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.299
 we come to the world life heals and in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 in heaps and shared it the same operation for 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.240
 another camera we turn on with a robot 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.400
 need a little different we all do 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.390
 also approach the station clamp shift 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.250
 click the right mouse button all 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.200
 have attached ajax to the robot itself need 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 just come up and click the mouse button 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.479
 so how if we grip shift and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 click the mouse then we will it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.329
 strip kill yourself and dropping like this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.299
 in the light of him, what will he do after 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.850
 we turn it on 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.130
 kill all hostile mobs slow 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 a lot of the background will not touch them, so he 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.390
 so little by little will kill outside 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 whichever hacks open 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.180
 or a skeleton it will be they all bring down all 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 it is also interesting that he can 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.689
 kill even dungeons and now not 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.680
 remember 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.660
 spook and here and see how 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:10.640
 possession look at the spider see him 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.640
 so they had a review 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.270
 Well, in all directions, diverge even through 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.240
 borki 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.860
 Well, on this actually with fashion all with 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.260
