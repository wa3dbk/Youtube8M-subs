about the Panasonic fuzzy logic rice
cooker<00:00:25.050> um<00:00:25.849> this<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> those<00:00:29.480> devices

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
um again this is by Panasonic and just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.000 
um again this is by Panasonic and just
to<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> good<00:00:54.360> idea<00:00:54.719> first<00:00:55.110> its<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.829> it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to get a good idea first its see it's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.080 
to get a good idea first its see it's
not<00:00:56.190> too<00:00:56.460> big

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
not too big

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
not too big
hold<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> close<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hold it close to me so you can see the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
hold it close to me so you can see the
real<00:00:58.829> size<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.760> long<00:00:59.879> as<00:00:59.969> bigger<00:01:00.120> than<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
real size as long as bigger than it is I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.770 
real size as long as bigger than it is I
just<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> cool<00:01:02.760> carryin<00:01:03.180> handle<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just have a cool carryin handle so you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
just have a cool carryin handle so you
can<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:05.010> place<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> next

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
can get it from one place to the next

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.820 
can get it from one place to the next
fairly<00:01:06.420> easily<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:08.070> has<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> digital<00:01:09.180> display

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
fairly easily it has a digital display

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.280 
fairly easily it has a digital display

open it up non-stick pan inside here and
why<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> great<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.810> fuzzy<00:01:37.320> logic

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
why is this so great what is fuzzy logic

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
why is this so great what is fuzzy logic
me<00:01:37.890> maybe<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> don't<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.610> well<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.689> you've

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
me maybe you don't know well if you've

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
me maybe you don't know well if you've
used<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.290> recipe<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.770> before<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> lot

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
used a recipe for before you know a lot

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.200 
used a recipe for before you know a lot
of<00:01:41.670> times<00:01:42.890> after<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> rice<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.369> cooked<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of times after the rice is cooked the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
of times after the rice is cooked the
rice<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.159> middle<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> most<00:01:48.329> part

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
rice in the middle and for the most part

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.190 
rice in the middle and for the most part
is<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.799> great<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> edges<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
is is great but on the edges on the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.389 
is is great but on the edges on the
bottom<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:54.780> sticks<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> pan<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.130> gets

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
bottom it it sticks to the pan or gets

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.770 
bottom it it sticks to the pan or gets
overdone

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
overdone

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
overdone
fuzzy<00:01:58.500> logic<00:01:58.759> uses<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.259> very<00:02:01.259> cool<00:02:02.219> technique

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
fuzzy logic uses a very cool technique

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.230 
fuzzy logic uses a very cool technique
to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.859 
to
cook<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.900> rice<00:02:04.049> evenly<00:02:04.729> regardless<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
cook the rice evenly regardless of the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.830 
cook the rice evenly regardless of the
proximity<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> algorithm<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.539> all

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
proximity to the algorithm and so all

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.000 
proximity to the algorithm and so all
the<00:02:10.289> rice<00:02:10.500> cooks<00:02:11.420> great<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.690> don't<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:13.110> rice

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the rice cooks great you don't have rice

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.030 
the rice cooks great you don't have rice
stuck<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> bottom<00:02:14.819> or<00:02:15.800> overcooked<00:02:16.800> rice

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
stuck to the bottom or overcooked rice

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.530 
stuck to the bottom or overcooked rice
on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> bottom<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.270> kind<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
on the bottom that you have to kind of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.830 
on the bottom that you have to kind of
avoid<00:02:18.810> all<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.709> rice<00:02:19.890> comes<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:21.000> beautifully

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
avoid all the rice comes out beautifully

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.790 
avoid all the rice comes out beautifully
and<00:02:21.870> very<00:02:22.110> flaking<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.690> these<00:02:25.140> cost<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and very flaking and so these cost a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.320 
and very flaking and so these cost a
little<00:02:25.920> bit<00:02:26.069> more<00:02:26.370> than<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.880> standard

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
little bit more than your just standard

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.660 
little bit more than your just standard
rice<00:02:27.900> cookers<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:28.860> why<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.430> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670
