00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
I assume also that you actually did do a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.160 
I assume also that you actually did do a
proper<00:02:57.790> design<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.390> all<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.720> before<00:02:58.930> you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
proper design for all of this before you

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.050 
proper design for all of this before you
started<00:02:59.470> building<00:02:59.770> was<00:03:00.460> all<00:03:00.580> up<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:00.910> oh

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
started building was all up here oh

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.440 
started building was all up here oh
really

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
really

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.550 
really

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.120 

now<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.489> looks<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.180> 200<00:03:12.930> acres<00:03:13.260> roughly<00:03:13.800> how

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
now it looks to be 200 acres roughly how

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.990 
now it looks to be 200 acres roughly how
big<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.610> thing

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
big with this thing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.190 
big with this thing
well<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.270> section<00:03:15.630> you're<00:03:15.750> looking<00:03:15.930> at<00:03:16.080> here

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
well this section you're looking at here

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070 
well this section you're looking at here
Don<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.620> only<00:03:16.739> 1/4<00:03:17.370> acre<00:03:17.520> that's<00:03:18.480> all<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.959> is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
Don it's only 1/4 acre that's all it is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.170 
Don it's only 1/4 acre that's all it is
really<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.040> has<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.340> illusion<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.000> being

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
really but it has that illusion of being

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.729 
really but it has that illusion of being
bigger<00:03:21.510> because<00:03:21.720> we've<00:03:22.020> again<00:03:22.260> blocked<00:03:22.590> out

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
bigger because we've again blocked out

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.140 
bigger because we've again blocked out
our<00:03:22.920> neighbors<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:23.670> did<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.060> I

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
believe it well I think it's a

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.379 
believe it well I think it's a
combination<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.290> good<00:04:40.470> soil<00:04:41.300> bit<00:04:42.300> of

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
combination of the good soil bit of

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.240 
combination of the good soil bit of
fertilizer<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.650> know<00:04:43.680> bit<00:04:44.160> of

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
fertilizer and just you know bit of

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.860 
fertilizer and just you know bit of
watering<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.760> yeah<00:04:45.000> these<00:04:45.150> are<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.360> results

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
watering and yeah these are the results

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.150 
watering and yeah these are the results
what<00:04:46.020> fertilisers<00:04:46.560> do<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.770> use<00:04:46.919> we<00:04:47.130> use

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
what fertilisers do you use we use

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.280 
what fertilisers do you use we use
organic<00:04:47.490> based<00:04:47.910> fertilisers<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:49.110> don't

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
organic based fertilisers but don't

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.659 
organic based fertilisers but don't
forget<00:04:49.440> Don<00:04:49.740> you're<00:04:49.919> here<00:04:50.070> in<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> subtropics

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
forget Don you're here in the subtropics

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.490 
forget Don you're here in the subtropics
so<00:04:51.000> everything<00:04:51.630> grows<00:04:51.840> quicker<00:04:52.169> than<00:04:52.350> what

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
so everything grows quicker than what

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:02.490 
so everything grows quicker than what
you<00:04:52.800> know<00:04:52.919> where<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.160> come<00:04:53.340> from

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.460 

I<00:05:02.560> mean<00:05:02.950> this<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.190> obviously<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:04.690> future<00:05:05.110> of

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
I mean this is obviously the future of

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.580 
I mean this is obviously the future of
Queensland<00:05:06.250> god<00:05:06.850> I'd<00:05:07.570> like<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.960> think<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:08.380> Don

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
Queensland god I'd like to think so Don

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.200 
Queensland god I'd like to think so Don
I<00:05:08.620> mean<00:05:08.800> we<00:05:08.950> live<00:05:09.190> in<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.430> subtropics<00:05:09.850> these

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
I mean we live in the subtropics these

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.900 
I mean we live in the subtropics these
plants<00:05:10.660> do<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.200> well<00:05:11.500> for<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.220> little<00:05:12.700> effort

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
plants do so well for so little effort

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.180 
plants do so well for so little effort
and<00:05:13.270> sound<00:05:13.540> it'll<00:05:13.750> work<00:05:13.930> why<00:05:14.620> shouldn't<00:05:15.010> we<00:05:15.070> be

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
and sound it'll work why shouldn't we be

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.010 
and sound it'll work why shouldn't we be
growing<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.580> style<00:05:15.850> of<00:05:15.940> garden<00:05:16.300> up<00:05:16.390> here<00:05:16.600> and

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
growing this style of garden up here and

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.080 
growing this style of garden up here and
we<00:05:17.230> should<00:05:17.290> point<00:05:17.680> out<00:05:17.860> almost<00:05:18.610> all<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:18.880> this

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
we should point out almost all of this

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.520 
we should point out almost all of this
could<00:05:19.540> be<00:05:19.780> done

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
could be done

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.380 
could be done
down<00:05:20.770> south<00:05:21.100> whether<00:05:21.430> it's<00:05:21.610> Melbourne<00:05:22.090> or

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
down south whether it's Melbourne or

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.930 
down south whether it's Melbourne or
even<00:05:22.870> Hobart<00:05:23.290> a<00:05:23.560> lot<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.310> these<00:05:24.430> effects<00:05:24.790> you

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
even Hobart a lot of these effects you

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.850 
even Hobart a lot of these effects you
could<00:05:25.090> create<00:05:25.270> with<00:05:25.570> cooler<00:05:25.870> climate<00:05:26.440> plants

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
could create with cooler climate plants

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.800 
could create with cooler climate plants
down<00:05:27.040> there<00:05:27.340> absolutely<00:05:28.030> you've<00:05:28.420> got<00:05:28.600> some

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
down there absolutely you've got some

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.440 
down there absolutely you've got some
fantastic<00:05:29.710> wonderful<00:05:30.040> foliage<00:05:30.820> plants<00:05:31.270> down

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
fantastic wonderful foliage plants down

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.610 
fantastic wonderful foliage plants down
that<00:05:31.690> could<00:05:31.870> grow<00:05:32.020> in<00:05:32.170> Sydney<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:32.560> Melbourne

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
that could grow in Sydney and Melbourne

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.830 
that could grow in Sydney and Melbourne
so<00:05:33.040> you<00:05:33.520> can<00:05:33.700> create<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.180> same<00:05:34.450> kind<00:05:34.480> of

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
so you can create the same kind of

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.110 
so you can create the same kind of
effect<00:05:34.990> down<00:05:35.620> there<00:05:35.919> all<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.550> do<00:05:36.700> is<00:05:36.820> just<00:05:37.000> use

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
effect down there all you do is just use

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:57.410 
effect down there all you do is just use
different<00:05:37.480> kinds<00:05:37.690> of<00:05:37.750> plants

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.480 

you
