00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
putty it comes in two different colors

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
putty it comes in two different colors

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and you have to knead it and roll it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.020 
and you have to knead it and roll it
together<00:00:33.180> until<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.230> color<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.739> uniform<00:00:35.030> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
together until the color is uniform and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.389

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
then it's ready for use

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
then it's ready for use
it's<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.210> putty<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:40.280> plasticine

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it's just just like putty or plasticine

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.479 
it's just just like putty or plasticine
whatever<00:00:41.850> modelling<00:00:42.480> clay<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.340> I've

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
whatever modelling clay and I think I've

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.690 
whatever modelling clay and I think I've
done<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> now<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.899> light<00:00:46.260> gray<00:00:46.559> color<00:00:46.800> so

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
done that now it's a light gray color so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.740 
done that now it's a light gray color so
I'm<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> put<00:00:48.239> some<00:00:50.510> underneath<00:00:51.510> where

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
I'm going to put some underneath where

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.529 
I'm going to put some underneath where
the<00:00:51.780> levers<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:53.610> squeeze<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the levers going to be just squeeze it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.979 
the levers going to be just squeeze it
in<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:56.120> that's<00:00:57.120> gonna<00:00:57.300> hold<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> leather

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
in there that's gonna hold the leather

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:40.060 
in there that's gonna hold the leather
in<00:00:58.230> place<00:00:58.850> a<00:01:01.730> little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.940> fiddly

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.930 

I'm<00:01:40.550> sommore<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.300> off<00:01:42.580> first<00:01:43.580> time<00:01:43.790> I've<00:01:43.910> used

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
I'm sommore it off first time I've used

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:52.330 
I'm sommore it off first time I've used
it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.330 

I<00:01:53.200> think<00:01:54.200> probably<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.740> potty<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.130> its

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
I think probably just the potty on its

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.050 
I think probably just the potty on its
own<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:56.810> fine<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.970> the<00:02:00.549> tining<00:02:01.549> cord<00:02:01.820> can

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
own do fine and then the tining cord can

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.469 
own do fine and then the tining cord can
tie<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.960> actually<00:02:03.140> bite<00:02:03.560> into<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.039> and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
tie in it can actually bite into it and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:14.339 
tie in it can actually bite into it and
as<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.630> dries<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:05.930> will<00:02:06.200> create<00:02:06.500> its<00:02:06.799> own<00:02:06.920> seal

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.250 

that's<00:02:15.349> used<00:02:15.860> one<00:02:16.670> blob<00:02:17.120> or<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.959> putty

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that's used one blob or the putty

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.589 
that's used one blob or the putty
because<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.680> comes<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.040> little<00:02:19.550> capsules<00:02:19.940> you

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
because it comes in little capsules you

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.570 
because it comes in little capsules you
can<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.340> I've<00:02:22.489> used<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.580> six

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
can see and I've used one out of the six

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:34.880 
can see and I've used one out of the six
there

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.350 

next<00:02:35.820> thing<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.270> insert<00:02:36.840> stock<00:02:38.210> into<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
next thing is to insert stock into the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.100 
next thing is to insert stock into the
bike<00:02:39.570> through<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.470> zip<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:44.720> here<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.930> have

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110

using<00:06:34.100> small<00:06:34.610> tine<00:06:34.910> in<00:06:35.090> strength<00:06:35.510> and<00:06:36.290> so<00:06:36.920> the

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
using small tine in strength and so the

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.220 
using small tine in strength and so the
end<00:06:37.310> of<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.730> tine<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.240> strength<00:06:38.630> I'm<00:06:38.900> using

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
end of the tine in strength I'm using

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.370 
end of the tine in strength I'm using
I'm<00:06:40.070> going<00:06:40.610> to<00:06:40.700> type<00:06:40.910> that<00:06:40.940> in<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.540> short<00:06:41.810> end

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
I'm going to type that in the short end

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:50.200 
I'm going to type that in the short end
of<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.740> loop<00:06:43.720> like<00:06:44.720> that<00:06:47.200> and<00:06:48.700> then<00:06:49.700> I'm<00:06:49.850> going

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
of the loop like that and then I'm going

of the loop like that and then I'm going
to<00:06:50.330> pull<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:50.840> loop<00:06:51.050> through<00:06:52.870> under<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.140> tine

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
to pull the loop through under the tine

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:02.869 
to pull the loop through under the tine
in<00:06:55.280> string<00:06:55.700> that's<00:06:56.660> actually<00:06:57.170> doing<00:06:57.500> the<00:06:57.650> job

it's just starting to pull the end of

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.270 
it's just starting to pull the end of
the<00:07:17.409> tie<00:07:17.620> names<00:07:17.830> strength<00:07:19.139> under<00:07:20.139> the<00:07:20.470> rest<00:07:21.099> of
