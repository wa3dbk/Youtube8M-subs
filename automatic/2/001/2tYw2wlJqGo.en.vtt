you place blocks behind the hoppers and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.840 
you place blocks behind the hoppers and
then<00:03:13.830> then<00:03:14.830> you're<00:03:14.980> also<00:03:15.130> going<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.640> go<00:03:15.760> in

mechanics<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> how<00:03:40.030> hoppers<00:03:40.450> and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
mechanics and how hoppers and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.440 
mechanics and how hoppers and
comparators<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:41.260> been<00:03:41.410> coded<00:03:41.709> together<00:03:42.450> you

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
comparators have been coded together you

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.960 
comparators have been coded together you
then<00:03:43.660> need<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> place<00:03:44.170> yourself<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.970> rejected

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
then need to place yourself a rejected

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.660 
then need to place yourself a rejected
items<00:03:46.330> chest<00:03:46.630> somewhere<00:03:47.230> I'll<00:03:48.040> stick<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
items chest somewhere I'll stick it

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.949 
items chest somewhere I'll stick it
there<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.269> doesn't<00:03:49.480> really<00:03:49.600> matter

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
there that doesn't really matter

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.810 
there that doesn't really matter
we'll<00:03:50.320> use<00:03:50.350> more<00:03:50.650> hoppers<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.100> get<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.519> but

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
we'll use more hoppers to get to it but

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.360 
we'll use more hoppers to get to it but
oh<00:03:52.150> well<00:03:52.959> I'm<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.380> creative<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:54.070> might<00:03:54.250> not

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
oh well I'm and creative you might not

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.810 
oh well I'm and creative you might not
be<00:03:54.489> who<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.700> am<00:03:54.880> ah<00:03:55.090> too<00:03:55.660> bad<00:03:56.519> you're<00:03:57.519> then<00:03:57.670> going

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
be who I am ah too bad you're then going

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.110 
be who I am ah too bad you're then going
to<00:03:57.970> run<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.330> line<00:03:58.600> across<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.380> top<00:03:59.790> into<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
to run a line across the top into the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.920 
to run a line across the top into the
rejected<00:04:01.570> items<00:04:01.930> chest<00:04:02.320> like<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:04.030> then

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
rejected items chest like so and then

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.990 
rejected items chest like so and then
place<00:04:05.200> an<00:04:05.500> input<00:04:05.830> chest<00:04:06.040> or<00:04:06.250> trap<00:04:06.489> chest<00:04:06.760> on

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
place an input chest or trap chest on

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.640 
place an input chest or trap chest on
the<00:04:07.060> top<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.510> one<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.630> these<00:04:07.750> hoppers<00:04:08.019> or<00:04:08.380> run

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
the top of one of these hoppers or run

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890 
the top of one of these hoppers or run
it<00:04:08.739> into<00:04:08.860> many<00:04:09.100> other<00:04:09.130> inputs<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.510> choice<00:04:10.720> is

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
it into many other inputs the choice is

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.100 
it into many other inputs the choice is
yours<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.350> course<00:04:12.239> one<00:04:13.239> thing<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.870> worth

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
yours of course one thing that is worth

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.409 
yours of course one thing that is worth
noting<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:15.340> mentioned<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.880> my<00:04:15.910> micro

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419

as<00:04:21.370> well<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:23.110> items<00:04:23.979> in<00:04:24.310> hoppers<00:04:24.850> will

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
as well is that items in hoppers will

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.940 
as well is that items in hoppers will
always<00:04:25.750> flow<00:04:25.930> downwards<00:04:26.349> before<00:04:26.560> they<00:04:26.650> flow

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
always flow downwards before they flow

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.620 
always flow downwards before they flow
to<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.190> side<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:27.789> due<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.479> game

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
to the side this is due to the game

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.200 
to the side this is due to the game
mechanic<00:04:29.050> on<00:04:29.200> which<00:04:29.470> hoppers<00:04:29.830> run<00:04:30.070> even<00:04:31.030> if

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
mechanic on which hoppers run even if

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.070 
mechanic on which hoppers run even if
they're<00:04:31.330> pointing<00:04:31.720> so

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
they're pointing so

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.050 
they're pointing so
ways<00:04:32.229> they<00:04:32.590> will<00:04:32.680> always<00:04:32.860> check<00:04:33.250> for<00:04:33.669> space

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
ways they will always check for space

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.129 
ways they will always check for space
bolete<00:04:34.449> beneath

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
bolete beneath

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.800 
bolete beneath
before<00:04:35.560> flowing<00:04:36.490> along<00:04:36.849> the<00:04:37.150> contraption

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
before flowing along the contraption

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.719 
before flowing along the contraption
which<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.710> basically<00:04:39.009> how<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.490> system<00:04:39.699> works

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
which is basically how this system works

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.279 
which is basically how this system works
you<00:04:42.729> have<00:04:42.939> actually<00:04:43.300> built<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.750> now<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.139> mean

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
you have actually built it now I mean

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.809 
you have actually built it now I mean
there's<00:04:44.500> there<00:04:44.889> isn't<00:04:45.069> really<00:04:45.219> much<00:04:45.340> more<00:04:45.610> to

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
there's there isn't really much more to

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.540 
there's there isn't really much more to
it<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.990> you've<00:04:47.289> got<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.620> program<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.129> system

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
it you you've got to program the system

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.149 
it you you've got to program the system
if<00:04:48.849> you<00:04:49.090> again<00:04:49.479> saw<00:04:49.780> Meyer<00:04:50.020> micro<00:04:50.860> item

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
if you again saw Meyer micro item

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.529 
if you again saw Meyer micro item
sorting<00:04:51.520> system<00:04:51.729> you'll<00:04:52.000> know<00:04:52.120> how<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.300> do

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
sorting system you'll know how to do

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.149 
sorting system you'll know how to do
that<00:04:52.719> but<00:04:53.319> if<00:04:53.379> not<00:04:53.530> I'll<00:04:53.710> actually<00:04:53.860> go<00:04:54.099> and

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
that but if not I'll actually go and

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.850 
that but if not I'll actually go and
explain<00:04:54.550> how<00:04:54.729> it's<00:04:54.879> done<00:04:55.030> over<00:04:55.449> here<00:04:55.860> because

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
explain how it's done over here because

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.409 
explain how it's done over here because
I<00:04:57.099> won't<00:04:57.370> go<00:04:57.520> ahead<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.819> program<00:04:57.969> all<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.360> it

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
I won't go ahead and program all that it

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.110 
I won't go ahead and program all that it
takes<00:04:58.659> time<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.860> basically<00:05:00.069> the<00:05:00.729> item<00:05:01.000> that

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
takes time but basically the item that

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.879 
takes time but basically the item that
you're<00:05:01.210> sorting<00:05:01.689> so<00:05:01.960> diamonds<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.590> this<00:05:02.680> one

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
you're sorting so diamonds in this one

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.550 
you're sorting so diamonds in this one
iron<00:05:03.069> in<00:05:03.189> this<00:05:03.340> one<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:04.090> need<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.330> place<00:05:04.479> 22<00:05:04.990> of

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
iron in this one you need to place 22 of

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.580 
iron in this one you need to place 22 of
those<00:05:05.740> items<00:05:06.009> in<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:07.139> hopper<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.349> points

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
those items in this hopper the points

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.790 
those items in this hopper the points
into<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.860> comparator<00:05:09.870> 22<00:05:10.870> because<00:05:11.199> as<00:05:11.620> soon

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
into the comparator 22 because as soon

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.089 
into the comparator 22 because as soon
as<00:05:11.919> 23<00:05:12.639> items<00:05:13.479> are<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.020> ie<00:05:14.289> deposited<00:05:15.009> from

as 23 items are in it ie deposited from

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.129 
as 23 items are in it ie deposited from
the<00:05:15.250> one<00:05:15.370> above<00:05:15.639> then<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.569> comparator<00:05:17.050> will

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
the one above then the comparator will

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.290 
the one above then the comparator will
change<00:05:17.379> to<00:05:17.530> an<00:05:17.620> output<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:17.919> 2<00:05:18.009> go<00:05:18.879> down<00:05:19.090> to<00:05:19.210> the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
change to an output of 2 go down to the
