00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.190 

okay<00:00:04.670> so<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.029> is<00:00:05.240> a<00:00:05.270> system<00:00:05.750> that<00:00:05.870> I<00:00:05.930> called

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay so this is a system that I called

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.700 
okay so this is a system that I called
10<00:00:06.500> times<00:00:06.830> for<00:00:07.510> this<00:00:08.510> works<00:00:08.840> not<00:00:09.139> when<00:00:09.379> the<00:00:09.500> cue

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
10 times for this works not when the cue

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.470 
10 times for this works not when the cue
ball<00:00:09.920> is<00:00:10.100> frozen<00:00:10.430> of<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:10.760> object<00:00:11.120> ball<00:00:11.240> but

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
ball is frozen of the object ball but

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.730 
ball is frozen of the object ball but
when<00:00:11.600> two<00:00:11.750> object<00:00:12.170> balls<00:00:12.379> are<00:00:12.559> frozen

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
when two object balls are frozen

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.439 
when two object balls are frozen
together<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.580> they<00:00:13.670> really<00:00:14.029> have<00:00:14.209> to<00:00:14.330> be

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:14.449 
together and they really have to be

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.490 
together and they really have to be
touching<00:00:14.690> her<00:00:14.900> won't<00:00:15.199> work<00:00:15.410> at<00:00:15.590> all<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:18.170> idea

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
touching her won't work at all the idea

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.620 
touching her won't work at all the idea
is<00:00:18.770> that<00:00:18.800> if<00:00:19.130> you<00:00:19.160> hit<00:00:19.550> a<00:00:19.820> ball<00:00:20.150> that's<00:00:20.359> frozen

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
is that if you hit a ball that's frozen

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.810 
is that if you hit a ball that's frozen
to<00:00:20.990> another<00:00:21.199> Bowl<00:00:21.439> with<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.740> cue<00:00:21.949> ball<00:00:22.160> this

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
to another Bowl with the cue ball this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.810 
to another Bowl with the cue ball this
ball<00:00:23.179> will<00:00:23.419> actually<00:00:23.929> go<00:00:24.109> through<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.980> change

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
ball will actually go through and change

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.029 
ball will actually go through and change
the<00:00:25.970> angle<00:00:26.240> from<00:00:26.599> 90<00:00:26.990> degrees<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.679> something

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
the angle from 90 degrees to something

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.599 
the angle from 90 degrees to something
ahead<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.369> 90<00:00:28.699> degrees<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.039> it's<00:00:31.039> the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
ahead of 90 degrees so it's the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:32.920 
ahead of 90 degrees so it's the
construction<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.390> similar<00:00:32.630> to<00:00:32.840> the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
construction is similar to the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.070 
construction is similar to the
construction<00:00:33.440> for<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.010> 2<00:00:34.160> x<00:00:34.460> 4<00:00:34.760> system<00:00:35.329> that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
construction for the 2 x 4 system that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.990 
construction for the 2 x 4 system that
is<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:36.470> begin<00:00:36.830> with<00:00:37.070> where<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.460> balls<00:00:37.670> are

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
is we begin with where the balls are

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.090 
is we begin with where the balls are
pointed<00:00:40.900> which<00:00:41.900> is<00:00:42.080> where<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.410> third<00:00:42.620> king<00:00:42.890> is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
pointed which is where the third king is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.640 
pointed which is where the third king is
and<00:00:43.400> then<00:00:44.210> we<00:00:44.360> take<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.780> distance<00:00:44.960> from<00:00:45.470> the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
and then we take the distance from the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.960 
and then we take the distance from the
13<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.640> 9<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.590> we<00:00:48.590> go<00:00:48.800> one<00:00:49.370> tenth<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.910> that

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
13 to the 9 and we go one tenth of that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.170 
13 to the 9 and we go one tenth of that
distance<00:00:50.630> as<00:00:50.840> our<00:00:51.290> target<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.700> would<00:00:53.000> be

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
distance as our target so that would be

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.110 
distance as our target so that would be
since<00:00:53.810> this<00:00:53.990> is<00:00:54.200> five<00:00:54.470> diamonds<00:00:54.940> half<00:00:55.940> a

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
since this is five diamonds half a

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.990 
since this is five diamonds half a
diamond<00:00:56.300> over<00:00:56.950> from<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.100> line<00:00:58.310> of<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.820> one

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
diamond over from the line of the one

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.539 
diamond over from the line of the one
and<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.330> three<00:01:00.400> so<00:01:01.400> now<00:01:01.610> all<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.150> have<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.660> do<00:01:02.840> is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
and the three so now all I have to do is

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.670 
and the three so now all I have to do is
shoot<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.610> one<00:01:04.939> ball<00:01:04.970> at<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.780> five<00:01:05.960> ball<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
shoot the one ball at the five ball and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.429 
shoot the one ball at the five ball and
you'll<00:01:07.400> find<00:01:07.670> on<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:07.999> shot<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:09.140> helps

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
you'll find on this shot that it helps

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.230 
you'll find on this shot that it helps
to<00:01:09.499> have<00:01:09.710> some<00:01:10.009> drawing<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.520> key<00:01:10.670> ball<00:01:10.909> to

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
to have some drawing the key ball to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.179 
to have some drawing the key ball to
help<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.810> one<00:01:11.960> ball<00:01:12.200> through<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.770> three<00:01:12.979> ball

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
help the one ball through the three ball

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.489 
help the one ball through the three ball
okay<00:01:14.060> let<00:01:14.179> me<00:01:14.299> try<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.509> I'll<00:01:14.960> shoot<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.320> one

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
okay let me try that I'll shoot the one

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.940 
okay let me try that I'll shoot the one
ball<00:01:15.789> straight<00:01:16.789> at<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:16.999> five<00:01:17.499> which<00:01:18.499> is<00:01:18.530> 10

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
ball straight at the five which is 10

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.950 
ball straight at the five which is 10
times<00:01:19.130> 4<00:01:19.579> than<00:01:19.819> if<00:01:19.939> I<00:01:20.060> wanted<00:01:20.359> to<00:01:20.509> play<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.840> 1

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
times 4 than if I wanted to play the 1

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:33.270 
times 4 than if I wanted to play the 1
ball<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.619> 9

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.830 

okay<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.700> another<00:01:34.909> shot<00:01:35.329> in<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.659> cap

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
okay this is another shot in the cap

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.810 
okay this is another shot in the cap
times<00:01:36.140> floor<00:01:36.470> system<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.310> similar<00:01:37.610> that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
times floor system that similar that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.639 
times floor system that similar that
last<00:01:38.090> shot<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.600> some<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.960> two<00:01:39.110> times<00:01:39.380> floor

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
last shot is some of the two times floor

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.460 
last shot is some of the two times floor
system<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:41.270> one<00:01:41.479> ball<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.899> frozen<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
system the one ball is frozen to the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.429 
system the one ball is frozen to the
three<00:01:42.770> ball<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.149> one<00:01:44.330> ball<00:01:44.439> Caroline

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
three ball and the one ball Caroline

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.590 
three ball and the one ball Caroline
almost<00:01:46.039> goes<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.549> pocket<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.060> not<00:01:47.270> quite

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
almost goes to the pocket but not quite

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.100 
almost goes to the pocket but not quite
we<00:01:47.899> have<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.170> bring<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.439> over<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.740> little<00:01:48.920> bit<00:01:49.159> so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
we have to bring it over a little bit so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.580 
we have to bring it over a little bit so
they<00:01:51.110> slam<00:01:51.740> us<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.100> here<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.960> want<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.439> go

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
they slam us to here we want it to go

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.669 
they slam us to here we want it to go
here<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.490> have<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.880> measure<00:01:56.060> over<00:01:56.679> ten

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
here and so we have to measure over ten

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.950 
here and so we have to measure over ten
times<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.850> amount<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.330> correction<00:01:59.810> we

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
times the amount of the correction we

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.660 
times the amount of the correction we
want<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.409> eventually<00:02:00.830> we<00:02:01.009> get<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.429> chalk

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
want and eventually we get to the chalk

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.419 
want and eventually we get to the chalk
after<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.149> measure<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.619> all<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.130> should

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
after we measure that so all I should

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.660 
after we measure that so all I should
have<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.759> do<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.630> play<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.080> one<00:02:06.440> ball<00:02:06.709> directly

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
have to do is play the one ball directly

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.330
