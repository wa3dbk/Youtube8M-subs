my<00:01:02.879> PhD

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.160 

here

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.830 

now<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.580> too<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.360> hard<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> get

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
now it's a little too little hard to get

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.490 
now it's a little too little hard to get
in<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.970> once<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.450> pretty<00:01:19.170> easy

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.060 

okay<00:01:25.280> um<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:26.690> does<00:01:26.900> take<00:01:27.110> batteries<00:01:27.620> i<00:01:27.830> think

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
okay um it does take batteries i think

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.820 
okay um it does take batteries i think
it<00:01:28.160> like<00:01:28.340> takes<00:01:28.840> 3<00:01:30.460> 3<00:01:31.460> double<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> batteries<00:01:32.830> so

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
it like takes 3 3 double a batteries so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.010 
it like takes 3 3 double a batteries so
keep<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.280> mind<00:01:34.510> okay<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.870> just

am<00:02:06.050> i<00:02:06.200> finding<00:02:06.410> myself

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.050 

it's<00:02:21.440> pretty<00:02:21.620> quarter<00:02:22.010> like<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.730> come

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's pretty quarter like have it come

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's pretty quarter like have it come
out<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> speakers<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.770> have<00:02:24.890> controls

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
out the speakers and you have controls

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.340 
out the speakers and you have controls
right<00:02:25.459> here

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.780 

but<00:02:33.350> if<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.560> could<00:02:33.710> hear<00:02:33.920> when<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.160> ended<00:02:34.670> up

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
but if you could hear when I ended up

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.190 
but if you could hear when I ended up
that<00:02:34.970> high<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:36.490> music<00:02:37.490> got<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:38.480> started<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
that high the music got to started and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.490 
that high the music got to started and
then<00:02:39.530> sound<00:02:39.890> quite<00:02:40.250> good<00:02:40.750> but<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.810> mean<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.440> is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
then sound quite good but I mean this is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:55.660 
then sound quite good but I mean this is
a<00:02:42.650> pretty<00:02:42.980> cool<00:02:43.160> car

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.880 

I<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.180> could<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.360> used<00:02:59.959> as<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.349> music

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
I think this could be used as like music

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.449 
I think this could be used as like music
like<00:03:02.050> amplifier<00:03:03.050> free<00:03:03.349> music<00:03:03.620> obviously<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
like amplifier free music obviously and

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.790 
like amplifier free music obviously and
maybe<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.940> if<00:03:05.780> you're<00:03:05.959> watching<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.440> movie
