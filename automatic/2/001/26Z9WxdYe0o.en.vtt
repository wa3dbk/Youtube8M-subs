00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.239
 Came here on the return trip and 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.190
 he throws a check here now 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.180
 can see with style he has already changed this 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:21.380

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.780
 that you selected there in that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.450
 place in the selection neither is this one here 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.450
 I will also always select profile law 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:54.640
 opening here already on any map map 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.490
 tests 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.890
 good now if you now that you are 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.850
 seeing here today attacked the corner that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.270
 You arrived at that site but guys 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.620
 You have an imposing with this way of you. 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.510
 To do this, Kim has no way she can not. 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.640
 appear in the multiplayer galley show 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.829
 attention does not appear in multiplayer 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.100
 that way for the benefit when the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.850
 new schin because you replaced 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.669
 to the file that had instinct style 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.040
 then everyone with everyone who had 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.080
 that Steve will appear with the same 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.270
 it would be again that in my case 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.690
 was this the people who have 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.370
 when you there in no multiplayer will not 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.660
 see you with these nice to see you like 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.330
 normal steve 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.210
 ok guys so it's here so single 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.580
 player does not work and multiplayer 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.430
 Okay, now I 'll teach you a way 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.320
 that works in multiplayer and I think 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.720
 Best not accept your friends 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.290
 play you do not change anything there right? 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.050
 you see can close you mark 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.870
 here and see on this site and missing Sergio 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.350
 then you opened it here I'm leaving 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 the two of são josé and bronze corner 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.270
 here and here you look for as soon as 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.110
 You want to, for example, I'll get it here. 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.560
 I do not feel this, I will not get this 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.500
 guy bored here main team name 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:33.430
 to realize that gadini has to know the 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 moment of pressing the iaaf trigger on the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.260
 time you select a name it gives 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.180
 its manifesto that will want to play 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:48.720
 You put the same name here. 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.720
 supertau cade time puts such age 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.610
 unfortunately there gives us the play right people 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.750
 even easier to do not need 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.410
 install nothing download anything ready now 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:05.070
 that already opened the time we will see here gave 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.530
 Okay, the guys already have access to Japan with 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.620
 But you, if you want 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.090
 this method your name will go 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.000
 stay like the name you put in the 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.220
 It's going to have to be this way and grace. 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.780
 you can be between 1 and 1 Serbia 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:24.000
 multiplayer that is pirate né 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.190
 hence you are entering the theme of the 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.560
 future child works of this problem 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.090
 I'll try to get in this get out of here. 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.690
 same 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.690
 This will give 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.360
 I entered here only proving that 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.290
 much attention when you enter the 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.410
 brain 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.480
 if he asks to sign in now the record 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.590
 because if they ask for multiple login 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.900
 elcoma login bar have any of it 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.250
 will not work or if you also make the 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.370
 record bar né 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.680
 it will not work because someone 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.540
 already registered with this same you are already 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.030
 registered with this same link already 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.250
 registered then it will not work for you 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.600
 You have to pick one and pick it up right here. 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.580
 that no one has chosen as soon as 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.320
 no one has yet registered the server 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.590
 So, guys, I'll explain again here. 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.960
 to speak in the term this time that 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.970
 another way does not appear in multiplayer 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.710
 only the single player 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.660
 this way I just taught that 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.560
 have to change the name appears in the 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.300
 multiplayer 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.740
 but it has chances of someone already already 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.850
 is registered with this name then 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.440
 understood well in the galley 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.050
 so I'm going to finish what's already here 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.960
 It's getting longer 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:43.050
 I 've already taught here how to make any mistake. 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:46.620
 then left in the comments because there 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.540
 I can be helping you, no more 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.670
 time in this tutorial end 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.370
 So people look like you liked it . 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.400
 chilique and share with your friends 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.590
 also have larger pirates and 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.910
 main channel that will return 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.100
 registration because of that channel that the 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.450
 secondary understood then is this galera 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.450
 a hug and I went
