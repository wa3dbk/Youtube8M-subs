three<00:05:06.240> new<00:05:06.389> cards<00:05:06.659> and<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:06.990> start<00:05:07.229> over<00:05:07.319> again

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
three new cards and you start over again

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.490 
three new cards and you start over again
if<00:05:08.009> any<00:05:08.580> player<00:05:08.909> gets<00:05:09.449> the<00:05:09.599> 10<00:05:09.810> humiliation

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
if any player gets the 10 humiliation

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.529 
if any player gets the 10 humiliation
the<00:05:10.530> principle<00:05:11.069> comes<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.699> at<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.210> point

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
the principle comes in and at that point

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.749 
the principle comes in and at that point
whoever<00:05:12.870> has<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.110> least<00:05:13.139> humiliation<00:05:14.009> is<00:05:14.159> the

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
whoever has the least humiliation is the

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.450 
whoever has the least humiliation is the
winner<00:05:15.500> gameplay<00:05:16.500> for<00:05:16.710> what<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.979> food<00:05:17.219> is

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
winner gameplay for what the food is

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.999 
winner gameplay for what the food is
very<00:05:17.789> simple<00:05:18.360> everyone's<00:05:19.349> picking<00:05:19.590> actions

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
very simple everyone's picking actions

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.260 
very simple everyone's picking actions
at<00:05:20.129> the<00:05:20.219> same<00:05:20.400> time<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:20.849> you're<00:05:20.969> trying<00:05:21.210> to

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
at the same time so you're trying to

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.850 
at the same time so you're trying to
outguess<00:05:21.569> everyone<00:05:21.960> else<00:05:22.110> am<00:05:22.289> I<00:05:22.650> going<00:05:22.800> to

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
outguess everyone else am I going to

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.200 
outguess everyone else am I going to
play<00:05:23.069> a<00:05:23.099> throw<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.520> food<00:05:23.669> but<00:05:23.879> they're<00:05:24.120> going

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
play a throw the food but they're going

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.540 
play a throw the food but they're going
to<00:05:24.300> probably<00:05:24.509> dodge<00:05:24.779> in<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:25.020> first<00:05:25.259> turn<00:05:25.469> but<00:05:26.370> L

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
to probably dodge in a first turn but L

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.100 
to probably dodge in a first turn but L
everyone<00:05:26.940> always<00:05:27.090> tries<00:05:27.360> to<00:05:27.389> grab<00:05:27.539> food<00:05:27.840> from

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
everyone always tries to grab food from

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.360 
everyone always tries to grab food from
the<00:05:28.199> middle<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.440> for<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> first<00:05:29.039> turn<00:05:29.219> so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
the middle the for the first turn so

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.619 
the middle the for the first turn so
maybe<00:05:29.550> that's<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.759> great<00:05:29.939> time<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.360> throw

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
maybe that's a great time to throw

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.629 
maybe that's a great time to throw
something<00:05:30.990> at<00:05:31.050> someone<00:05:31.349> else<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:31.680> then<00:05:32.340> duck

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
something at someone else and then duck

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.640 
something at someone else and then duck
on<00:05:32.819> future<00:05:33.150> turns<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.870> there's<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.169> back<00:05:34.409> and

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
on future turns so there's that back and

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.589 
on future turns so there's that back and
forth<00:05:34.889> and<00:05:35.129> then<00:05:35.430> building<00:05:35.789> up<00:05:35.940> having<00:05:36.389> more

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
forth and then building up having more

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.140 
forth and then building up having more
action<00:05:37.050> cards<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.500> play<00:05:37.650> on<00:05:38.039> other<00:05:38.520> people<00:05:38.969> and

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
action cards to play on other people and

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.180 
action cards to play on other people and
having<00:05:39.719> your<00:05:39.900> own<00:05:39.960> special<00:05:40.500> action<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:40.949> after

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
having your own special action and after

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.529 
having your own special action and after
what<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:41.580> know<00:05:41.669> only<00:05:41.849> a<00:05:42.000> few<00:05:42.180> minutes

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
what you know only a few minutes

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.300 
what you know only a few minutes
everyone<00:05:43.319> knows<00:05:43.560> what<00:05:43.800> everyone<00:05:44.069> else<00:05:44.129> with

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
everyone knows what everyone else with

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.189 
everyone knows what everyone else with
special<00:05:44.639> action<00:05:44.909> is<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.270> so<00:05:45.810> they<00:05:45.930> know<00:05:46.080> what

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
special action is and so they know what

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.379 
special action is and so they know what
to<00:05:46.259> avoid<00:05:46.440> there's<00:05:47.190> also<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.639> fun<00:05:47.879> of<00:05:48.089> putting

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
to avoid there's also the fun of putting

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.600 
to avoid there's also the fun of putting
combos<00:05:48.930> together<00:05:49.379> as<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:50.159> look<00:05:50.430> at<00:05:50.580> these

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
combos together as you look at these

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.029 
combos together as you look at these
cards<00:05:51.330> that<00:05:51.479> are<00:05:51.599> are<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:52.229> this<00:05:52.409> deck<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.949> I

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
cards that are are in this deck like I

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.589 
cards that are are in this deck like I
might<00:05:53.219> have<00:05:53.430> some<00:05:53.669> fried<00:05:54.120> chicken<00:05:54.509> and

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
might have some fried chicken and

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:57.320 
might have some fried chicken and
waffles<00:05:55.020> dripping<00:05:55.589> in<00:05:55.740> nacho<00:05:56.279> cheese<00:05:56.330> but

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
waffles dripping in nacho cheese but

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.420 
waffles dripping in nacho cheese but
then<00:05:57.509> I<00:05:57.539> play<00:05:57.839> the<00:05:58.020> rotten<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:58.680> them<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.099> so

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
then I play the rotten on them and so

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.159 
then I play the rotten on them and so
there's<00:05:59.639> the<00:05:59.759> funniness<00:06:00.060> of<00:06:00.389> what<00:06:00.629> objects

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
there's the funniness of what objects

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.959 
there's the funniness of what objects
you're<00:06:01.319> throwing<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:01.770> other<00:06:01.889> people<00:06:02.310> so

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
you're throwing in other people so

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.309 
you're throwing in other people so
essentially<00:06:03.360> it's<00:06:03.569> kind<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:03.870> like<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.080> take

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
essentially it's kind of like a take

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.200 
essentially it's kind of like a take
that<00:06:04.349> card<00:06:04.889> game<00:06:05.099> where<00:06:05.580> you<00:06:05.669> play<00:06:05.699> cards<00:06:06.180> with

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
that card game where you play cards with

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.329 
that card game where you play cards with
other<00:06:06.389> people<00:06:06.750> but<00:06:07.199> at<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.409> same<00:06:07.650> time<00:06:07.889> it<00:06:08.099> has

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:08.339 
other people but at the same time it has

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:09.920 
other people but at the same time it has
the<00:06:08.580> mixture<00:06:08.940> of<00:06:09.089> planning<00:06:09.539> your<00:06:09.659> moves

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
the mixture of planning your moves

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.559 
the mixture of planning your moves
planning<00:06:10.440> your<00:06:10.529> attacks<00:06:10.860> each<00:06:11.159> turn<00:06:11.460> so<00:06:12.210> it

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
planning your attacks each turn so it

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.459 
planning your attacks each turn so it
plays<00:06:12.960> very<00:06:13.139> quickly<00:06:13.440> very<00:06:13.620> fun<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:15.270> it's<00:06:16.259> one

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
plays very quickly very fun it it's one

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:17.689 
plays very quickly very fun it it's one
