 There are different types of skin deposit 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 of normal mixed thanks dry and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.590
 sensitive a good orval and sweet to 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.300
 uniform touch but without imperfection 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 appearances what we could 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 completely name a beautiful skin a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 good normal however needs to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 a lot of hydration to stay at if 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.770
 pretty if the skin and sometimes thanks on that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.950
 called the area was composed of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.610
 front of the nose with the wings of the nose and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.789
 chin we speak then of pau munich 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.730
 I have a mixed skin the production of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.219
 sebum is not excessive it is in 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 made of a well hydrated skin with a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.809
 nice physical chemistry that can be him 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 a little on the zone peace but it remains 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 skin that does not secrete too much 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 nitro sebum sweats the trap when one 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.830
 has a mixed skin is to think that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.100
 it's rather oily skin and suddenly 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.540
 to treat it as it would be used 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 then products he has caps 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 retro that would take away his movie 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.250
 protective lipid and what would 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.729
 that the skin would feel assaulted from 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 blow would secrete more sebum and there we 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.860
 observe a month a oily skin for the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.250
 if the appearance of the area is 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.090
 really ubi and if we shine 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.460
 the story the very morning has quickly 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.770
 learned this clean the face there one 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.930
 can talk about oily skin for 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.510
 put on the best is to do the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.350
 test the tissue paper to see the test 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.930
 tissue paper 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.140
 we're going to take a bunch of his very purposes 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.080
 light and better than a handkerchief 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.450
 actually made of tissue paper what it 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.570
 is even more hungry one cuts one 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.720
 small pension and we're going 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.100
 apply it at the end of the day on the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.340
 zone was so the front one goes down 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:22.959
 a fine comes back the nude the outline of the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:32.470
 nose and chin you go there we pass the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:35.500
 paper in the light if ever we have a 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.140
 translucent phase on his tissue paper 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.709
 it's all oily skin if you have 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.620
 oily skin 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.900
 no problem a skin thanks to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.170
 the advantages and disadvantages 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.910
 disadvantages to start the excess of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.760
 sebum 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.489
 in addition to the shiny aspect not ready to 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.470
 the love it confers will favor 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.610
 the appearance of pimples 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.010
 by against oily skin and dismembered 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.290
 well hydrated and layered 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.110
 leuze life that is actually going to be a movie 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.209
 protector for the whole skin this 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.360
 that makes a oily skin is less 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.100
 sensitive to variations 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.950
 of temperature is called factor 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.400
 outside in general but also at 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.980
 stress and wrinkles so pure vein 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.360
 prograf my shelter of dry skin get 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.280
 translated by feelings of 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.250
 tugging a hit rech 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 we will have farms and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.150
 regular sometimes even creatures 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.890
 dry skin is very sensitive to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.750
 cold and temperature variations 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.870
 usually because they lack 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.540
 protective lipids in epidermal water 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.190
 to finish dry skin get rid 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.140
 much faster than others 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.600
 it is therefore necessary to take 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.150
 care sensitive skin is then a 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.370
 skin type a little bit apart 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.400
 since there are not really any brands 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.560
 that make you have sensitive skin 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.900
 it's going to be in the evolution of the skin 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.150
 in time and compared to some 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.000
 external factors a sensitive skin this 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.239
 known to frequent sensation 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 tugging pau that sting that pulls 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.209
 who blushes quickly who ignites is a 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.040
 little bit a capricious skin he goes 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.959
 have to listen to the skins 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.150
 sensitive are fragile will avoid the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.970
 annoying is spent as little as possible 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.310
 by external actions but rather in 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.169
 take care of internal actions 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.300
 here I hope you have recognized your 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.580
 skin type in any case now you 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.580
