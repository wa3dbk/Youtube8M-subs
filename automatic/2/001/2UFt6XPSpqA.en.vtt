00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.069
 Hi, good looking, here you see me focusing 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.530
 a tupper covered with silver foil 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.890
 this is a request from alba triana 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.530
 ok, he asked me to teach how 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.180
 I did what sardines escabeche 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.160
 It was my fault that I have made 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.200
 do them and when you have already agreed to what 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 had done then well I'm going to 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.080
 try to explain it for something and to 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.250
 all of you good to see first 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.089
 place as he taught to see take the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.179
 sardines are cleaned they are salted and then the 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:40.699
 I've gone through flour and the fried e has 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:43.280
 followed by booking on a plate and when 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.339
 I already had them all fried in the same 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.710
 oil that gets enough oil 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.079
 put the garlic as you can see put 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 a head and a half of garlic is a kilogram of 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.229
 sardine be a head and a half of garlic 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.829
 slow fire that went browning without 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.589
 burn then I put the thyme that I have 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.040
 taken out but there was a little hand thyme 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.409
 and bay leaves 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.259
 I have left nothing two minutes that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.610
 they made him throw the red paprika already 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.470
 continued stretched 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 and a glass of 250 of water the normal glass 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 of water and put three quarts of vinegar 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.500
 and a quarter of water and I've put two 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.270
 equal vessels 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 this is depends on the amount of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.190
 sardines because as you see it has to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.180
 cover them is worth the juice since used 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.860
 two glasses then put salt and fire 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.620
 slow what I was letting him do chup 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 chup chup chup I've been testing if you've 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.390
 seemed like he was too strong of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.570
 vinegar I have put half a glass more than 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 water and good nothing a few minutes with the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.030
 chubut then I put the sardines in 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.159
 this tupper and when the salsita 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.530
 was thrown part of the thyme and 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.020
 thrown over the sardines 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 then they are today is Sundays are for the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.490
 Monday night for dinner and now 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 I'm going to leave them here on the marble 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.900
 I'm not going to put the lid on the tupper 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.599
 because as it was formerly done 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.450
 with clay pot but clear mud 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.340
 breathe and the plastic does not then not 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.860
 I'm going to put your lid on it but I'll have it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.470
 cover so they can breathe 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.890
 because this to see us we like to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.799
 room temperature is then worth the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.110
 I'm going to leave here and tomorrow for dinner 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.980
 they will be ready 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 I hope alva that has served you 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.930
 Anything you ask me and what 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.340

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.340

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.549
