00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
but for the most part most people that

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.640 
but for the most part most people that
have<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.850> headlock<00:03:11.209> they<00:03:12.079> leave<00:03:12.290> their<00:03:12.470> hair

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
have a headlock they leave their hair

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.470 
have a headlock they leave their hair
alone<00:03:12.950> because<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.430> can't<00:03:13.670> brush<00:03:13.940> lot<00:03:14.000> you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
alone because you can't brush lot you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.259 
alone because you can't brush lot you
can't<00:03:14.799> comb<00:03:15.799> them<00:03:16.130> there's<00:03:16.880> nothing<00:03:17.060> to

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
can't comb them there's nothing to

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.140 
can't comb them there's nothing to
detangle<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.799> I<00:03:18.829> think<00:03:19.010> when<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.459> go<00:03:19.609> natural

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
detangle so I think when you go natural

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.559 
detangle so I think when you go natural
yes

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
yes

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.050 
yes
tempted<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.560> was<00:03:21.829> simply<00:03:22.310> too<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.790> did

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
tempted and I was simply too and I did

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.849 
tempted and I was simply too and I did
over<00:03:23.810> manipulate<00:03:24.349> my<00:03:24.469> hair<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
over manipulate my hair and the

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.289 
over manipulate my hair and the
beginning<00:03:25.219> just<00:03:25.340> messing<00:03:25.790> with<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:26.030> all<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
beginning just messing with it all the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.119 
beginning just messing with it all the
time<00:03:26.359> trying<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.930> get<00:03:27.139> it<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.379> do<00:03:27.560> days<00:03:27.769> trying

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
time trying to get it to do days trying

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.250 
time trying to get it to do days trying
to<00:03:28.219> get<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.579> do<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:28.969> but<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.840> think<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:30.139> have

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
to get it to do that but I think we have

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.839 
to get it to do that but I think we have
to<00:03:30.409> realize<00:03:30.680> when<00:03:30.859> you<00:03:30.950> go<00:03:31.069> natural<00:03:31.579> let<00:03:31.700> you

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
to realize when you go natural let you

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.509 
to realize when you go natural let you
hear<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.299> what<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.629> was<00:03:32.749> intended<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.499> do<00:03:33.739> if<00:03:34.370> he

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
hear do what it was intended to do if he

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.030 
hear do what it was intended to do if he
is<00:03:34.790> fuzzy<00:03:35.269> let<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.510> be<00:03:35.599> fuzzy<00:03:35.840> if<00:03:36.319> it's<00:03:36.620> curly

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
is fuzzy let it be fuzzy if it's curly

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.099 
is fuzzy let it be fuzzy if it's curly
let<00:03:37.189> it<00:03:37.280> be<00:03:37.370> curly<00:03:37.790> if<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.359> sticks<00:03:38.629> straight<00:03:38.870> up

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
let it be curly if it sticks straight up

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.809 
let it be curly if it sticks straight up
you<00:03:39.319> know<00:03:39.439> let<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.799> sit<00:03:40.069> straight<00:03:40.280> up<00:03:40.340> that's

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
you know let it sit straight up that's

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.459 
you know let it sit straight up that's
one<00:03:41.060> thing<00:03:41.090> about<00:03:41.299> going<00:03:41.750> down<00:03:42.049> through<00:03:42.260> is

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
one thing about going down through is

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.679 
one thing about going down through is
embracing<00:03:42.980> your<00:03:43.280> hair<00:03:43.549> exactly<00:03:43.909> the<00:03:44.389> way<00:03:44.510> it

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
embracing your hair exactly the way it

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.080 
embracing your hair exactly the way it
is<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:46.159> if<00:03:46.280> you're<00:03:46.430> thinking<00:03:46.549> about<00:03:46.790> going
