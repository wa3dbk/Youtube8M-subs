sweat you know air is cutting through

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.569 
sweat you know air is cutting through
there<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> kind<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> reduce<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.430> amount<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
there to kind of reduce the amount of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
there to kind of reduce the amount of
steam<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> builds<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.750> behind<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
steam that kind of builds up behind the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350 
steam that kind of builds up behind the
eyes<00:00:37.350> I'll<00:00:37.980> try<00:00:38.219> these<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
eyes I'll try these on you can see that

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.440 
eyes I'll try these on you can see that
these<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.870> wrapped<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.730> don't<00:00:42.090> have

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
these are wrapped so if these don't have

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.470 
these are wrapped so if these don't have
this<00:00:43.079> ventilation<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.000> side<00:00:45.210> you're

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
this ventilation here on the side you're

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
this ventilation here on the side you're
probably<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.350> doing<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
probably when you're doing a lot of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
probably when you're doing a lot of
exercising<00:00:47.989> riding<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.079> bike<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.890> going<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
exercising riding a bike you're going to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.959 
exercising riding a bike you're going to
get<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> lot<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> buildup<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> steam<00:00:53.579> behind

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
get a lot of buildup of the steam behind

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.279 
get a lot of buildup of the steam behind
the<00:00:54.090> glasses<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.079> body

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the glasses just from your body

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
the glasses just from your body
temperature<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.129> relation<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> outside

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
temperature in relation to the outside

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
temperature in relation to the outside
so<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.710> prevents<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> glasses<00:00:59.789> from

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so this prevents the glasses from

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.349 
so this prevents the glasses from
steaming<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:01.250> again<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> tint<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.120> we'll

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
steaming up again the tint in here we'll

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
steaming up again the tint in here we'll
go<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:03.510> tense<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.229> later<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
go over tense a little bit later but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.700 
go over tense a little bit later but
this<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.640> again<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.470> type<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this is again so that the this type of

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.670 
this is again so that the this type of
tint<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> amber<00:01:08.760> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> orange-ish<00:01:09.540> color

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
tint this amber kind of orange-ish color

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
tint this amber kind of orange-ish color
allows<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.979> rider<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> pick<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.000> things<00:01:12.210> on

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
allows the rider to pick up things on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.440 
allows the rider to pick up things on
the<00:01:12.600> road<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.200> easier<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.460> again

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the road a little bit easier so again

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
the road a little bit easier so again
