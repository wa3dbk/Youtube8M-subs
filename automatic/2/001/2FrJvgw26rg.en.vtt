00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.950 
microphone the first microphone didn't
work<00:01:18.620> right<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.280> we'll<00:01:19.940> have<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.210> try<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.480> one

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
work right so we'll have to try this one

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.590 
work right so we'll have to try this one
see<00:01:21.680> if<00:01:21.770> there's<00:01:22.570> any<00:01:23.570> improvement<00:01:24.910> I<00:01:25.910> see<00:01:26.420> an

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:38.270 
audio indicator so I guess this one is
