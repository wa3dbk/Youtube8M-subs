00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.390

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.610

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.450

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.760
 I'm leaving the name of my blog and 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.950

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.010
 copy the molds 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.350
 ok then the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.350
 to be fold this piece 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.210
 and we're going to paste the top part where 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.850
 are the ears only ears and 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 a little bit of the head is what we're going 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.350
 to stick with silicone 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:26.450
 stick two ribbon cited on the ear 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.409
 what I did was a 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.820
 pretty with transparent blue ribbon and 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.539
 another bow with blue ribbon stronger and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.539
 more delgadito 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.650
 we place here the moÃ±itos 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.780
 and that's how the teddy bear has left us. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 You see beautiful what we're going to finally 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.960
 Doing is going to be putting your chocolate or 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.409
 chocolate as we know it here in 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.409
 Mexico 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.700
 well here is our blue site and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 we can also make bears for girl 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.930
 in pink 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.660
 you can use the color that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 they want can be in yellow 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:37.410
 even in light purple purple 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.140
 blue light or pastel shades and they are going to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.630
 see our beautiful teddy bears 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.490
 good eros, well let's do 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.970
 exactly the same as what we did with the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.380
 white bear with blue 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.380
 we attach the little ears 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.250
 we hit your little monkeys 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.530
 and now we put the chocolate or chocolate 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.490
 that in this case I have other 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.700
 flavors and other colors you can 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:24.430
 get another type of chocolates or 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.340
 even another kind of candy that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.280
 want to put here they can do what 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.270
 better a little bit bigger the hole 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.960
 this is a very simple idea very fast 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.290
 and super economical and finally they look 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.050
 very elegant and very nice our 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.150
 ositos as good here I leave this 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.940
 idea I hope you liked that the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.070
 put into practice and I wait for them in my 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.070
