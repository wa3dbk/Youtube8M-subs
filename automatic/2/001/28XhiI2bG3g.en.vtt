00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.019 

I<00:00:04.300> got<00:00:04.930> the<00:00:05.080> idea<00:00:05.200> for<00:00:05.590> the<00:00:05.710> table<00:00:06.070> about<00:00:06.279> three

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
I got the idea for the table about three

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:07.710 
I got the idea for the table about three
years<00:00:07.270> ago

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
years ago

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.170 
years ago
and<00:00:08.020> we<00:00:08.109> went<00:00:08.320> to<00:00:08.500> see<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:08.920> prototype<00:00:09.610> table<00:00:10.030> at

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
and we went to see a prototype table at

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.250 
and we went to see a prototype table at
the<00:00:10.270> University<00:00:10.630> of<00:00:10.660> Illinois<00:00:10.780> in<00:00:11.139> Chicago

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
the University of Illinois in Chicago

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.170 
the University of Illinois in Chicago
where<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:11.770> engineering<00:00:12.190> department<00:00:12.670> had

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
where the engineering department had

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.660 
where the engineering department had
built<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.540> table<00:00:13.750> but<00:00:14.290> it<00:00:14.440> was<00:00:14.650> too<00:00:15.099> clumsy<00:00:15.400> it

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
built a table but it was too clumsy it

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.330 
built a table but it was too clumsy it
was<00:00:15.760> six<00:00:16.000> screens<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.660> six<00:00:16.900> computers<00:00:17.439> and<00:00:17.830> it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
was six screens and six computers and it

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.210 
was six screens and six computers and it
wasn't<00:00:18.550> right<00:00:19.360> of<00:00:19.540> mine<00:00:19.779> so<00:00:20.110> I<00:00:20.349> went<00:00:21.009> back<00:00:21.189> a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
wasn't right of mine so I went back a

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.609 
wasn't right of mine so I went back a
year<00:00:21.610> later<00:00:22.210> when<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:22.630> had<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.869> modified

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
year later when they had a modified

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.280 
year later when they had a modified
version<00:00:23.649> of<00:00:24.130> it<00:00:24.279> with<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.399> single<00:00:24.820> monitor<00:00:25.290> it

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
version of it with a single monitor it

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.499 
version of it with a single monitor it
wasn't<00:00:26.619> exactly<00:00:26.980> what<00:00:27.099> we<00:00:27.220> wanted<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:27.700> we

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
wasn't exactly what we wanted but we

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.720 
wasn't exactly what we wanted but we
discussed<00:00:28.960> what<00:00:29.169> we<00:00:29.290> our<00:00:29.529> needs<00:00:29.800> would<00:00:30.040> be<00:00:30.070> and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
discussed what we our needs would be and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.339 
discussed what we our needs would be and
I<00:00:30.790> asked<00:00:31.119> if<00:00:31.180> they<00:00:31.300> would<00:00:31.419> build<00:00:31.660> one<00:00:31.779> for<00:00:32.200> us

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
I asked if they would build one for us

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.340 
I asked if they would build one for us
and<00:00:32.559> they<00:00:32.710> said<00:00:32.950> no<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:34.239> came<00:00:34.450> back<00:00:34.600> filed<00:00:35.230> a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
and they said no we came back filed a

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.419 
and they said no we came back filed a
couple<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.739> applications<00:00:36.340> for<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.969> grant<00:00:38.429> and

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:39.429 
couple of applications for a grant and

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.130 
couple of applications for a grant and
then<00:00:39.579> finally<00:00:40.000> found<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.300> not<00:00:40.449> Amash<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.960> build

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
then finally found a not Amash to build

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.650 
then finally found a not Amash to build
exactly<00:00:41.350> what<00:00:41.710> we<00:00:41.829> wanted<00:00:42.070> we<00:00:43.030> had<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.329> trial

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
exactly what we wanted we had a trial

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.520 
exactly what we wanted we had a trial
run<00:00:43.839> last<00:00:44.109> week<00:00:44.410> with<00:00:45.190> this<00:00:45.370> new<00:00:46.199> course<00:00:47.199> and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
run last week with this new course and

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.069 
run last week with this new course and
the<00:00:47.679> new<00:00:47.800> set<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.039> students<00:00:48.519> and<00:00:48.850> today<00:00:49.839> is<00:00:49.989> the

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
the new set of students and today is the

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.389 
the new set of students and today is the
first<00:00:50.260> time<00:00:50.320> we're<00:00:50.589> actually<00:00:50.710> using<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.219> for

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
first time we're actually using it for

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.340 
first time we're actually using it for
the<00:00:51.550> purpose<00:00:51.699> of<00:00:51.940> actual<00:00:52.239> teaching<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.780> our

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
the purpose of actual teaching and our

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.459 
the purpose of actual teaching and our
topic<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.370> upper<00:00:54.699> limb<00:00:55.019> they'd<00:00:56.019> say<00:00:56.199> it's<00:00:56.409> a

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
topic is upper limb they'd say it's a

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.829 
topic is upper limb they'd say it's a
wonderful<00:00:56.859> tool<00:00:57.159> I<00:00:57.190> think<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.730> highlight<00:00:58.089> some

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
wonderful tool I think to highlight some

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.180 
wonderful tool I think to highlight some
of<00:00:58.929> the<00:00:58.989> things<00:00:59.170> in<00:00:59.289> anatomy<00:00:59.559> that<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.010> don't

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
of the things in anatomy that we don't

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.389 
of the things in anatomy that we don't
usually<00:01:00.399> see<00:01:01.589> such<00:01:02.589> as<00:01:02.739> being<00:01:02.949> able<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.129> see

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
usually see such as being able to see

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.140 
usually see such as being able to see
the<00:01:04.300> vessels<00:01:04.839> arteries<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.680> veins<00:01:06.150> with

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
the vessels arteries and veins with

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.749 
the vessels arteries and veins with
bones<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.720> have<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.740> muscles<00:01:09.070> disappear<00:01:09.579> for

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
bones and have the muscles disappear for

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.899 
bones and have the muscles disappear for
example<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:11.110> putting<00:01:11.740> different<00:01:12.189> structures

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
example so putting different structures

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.899 
example so putting different structures
in<00:01:13.149> various<00:01:13.689> combinations<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:15.460> something

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
in various combinations is something

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.580 
in various combinations is something
that<00:01:16.060> doesn't<00:01:16.720> happen<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.259> normal

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
that doesn't happen in the normal

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.420 
that doesn't happen in the normal

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
for bioengineers it's an undergraduate

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.740 
for bioengineers it's an undergraduate
course<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.399> we<00:01:27.610> have<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> variety<00:01:28.270> of<00:01:28.299> students

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
course and we have a variety of students

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.780 
course and we have a variety of students
sophomores<00:01:29.229> juniors<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.860> seniors<00:01:30.040> most<00:01:30.610> of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
them majoring in bio engineering so we

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.800 
them majoring in bio engineering so we
divide<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.030> students<00:01:34.329> into<00:01:34.390> small<00:01:34.780> groups

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
divide the students into small groups

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.980 
divide the students into small groups
and<00:01:35.380> we<00:01:36.039> have<00:01:36.280> several<00:01:36.520> stations<00:01:36.990> including

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
and we have several stations including

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.440 
and we have several stations including
stations<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.710> have<00:01:38.950> pre<00:01:39.700> dissected<00:01:40.240> Pro

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
stations that have pre dissected Pro

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.749 
stations that have pre dissected Pro
sections<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.399> stations<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.549> have

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
sections and stations that have

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.480 
sections and stations that have
stereoscopic<00:01:43.570> images<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:45.070> stations

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
stereoscopic images and the stations

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.330 
stereoscopic images and the stations
with<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.759> virtual<00:01:46.000> dissecting<00:01:46.509> table<00:01:47.340> we

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
with the virtual dissecting table we

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.300 
with the virtual dissecting table we
have<00:01:48.609> a<00:01:48.640> variety<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.149> tools<00:01:49.450> on<00:01:49.719> hand<00:01:50.200> now<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
have a variety of tools on hand now and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.219 
have a variety of tools on hand now and
I<00:01:51.430> think<00:01:51.729> each<00:01:51.969> tool<00:01:52.450> offers<00:01:52.810> something

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
I think each tool offers something

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.789 
I think each tool offers something
unique<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:54.490> own<00:01:54.729> feeling<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.329> that<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.840> future

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
unique my own feeling is that the future

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.179 
unique my own feeling is that the future
will<00:01:57.009> be<00:01:57.189> some<00:01:57.670> form<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.600> hybrid

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
will be some form of a hybrid

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.020 
will be some form of a hybrid
educational<00:02:00.189> model<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.350> our<00:02:02.909> attempts<00:02:03.909> is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
educational model one of our attempts is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
try to define that as best as we can in

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.680 
try to define that as best as we can in

learning<00:02:10.690> pieces<00:02:11.050> are<00:02:11.260> best<00:02:11.800> learned<00:02:12.190> from<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
learning pieces are best learned from a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.380 
learning pieces are best learned from a
particular<00:02:13.710> format<00:02:14.710> of

coin is that different learners are
different<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.280> some<00:02:20.760> learners<00:02:21.060> might

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
different and so some learners might

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.510 
different and so some learners might
prefer<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.600> method<00:02:22.140> over<00:02:22.350> another<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.860> we

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
prefer one method over another and we

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.000 
prefer one method over another and we
offer<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.060> variety<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> learning<00:02:25.170> tools<00:02:25.380> then

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
offer the variety of learning tools then

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.590 
offer the variety of learning tools then
we're<00:02:26.190> best<00:02:26.760> serving<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> interests<00:02:27.540> of
