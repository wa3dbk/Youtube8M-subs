00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
longer because it allows me to

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.930 
longer because it allows me to
camouflage<00:04:07.990> my<00:04:08.470> hair<00:04:08.740> if<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.160> need<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.520> go<00:04:09.670> out

it's<00:04:12.730> easier<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.180> me<00:04:13.360> me<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.350> be<00:04:14.470> able<00:04:14.560> to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
it's easier for me me to be able to

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.770 
it's easier for me me to be able to
camouflage<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.670> I'm<00:04:15.790> deep<00:04:15.970> conditioning

when I put my hair in this target bag

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.380 
when I put my hair in this target bag
twist<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.049> up<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.200> put<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.920> in<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.190> bun<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.330> I'm

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
twist it up and put it in a bun so I'm

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.690

going to take this stocking cap to put

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.760 
going to take this stocking cap to put
over<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.450> made<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.840> out<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.110> an<00:04:26.290> old<00:04:26.530> pair

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
over and I made this out of an old pair

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.560 
over and I made this out of an old pair
of<00:04:26.800> stockings<00:04:27.070> by<00:04:27.490> cutting<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> legs<00:04:28.090> off<00:04:28.330> and

of stockings by cutting the legs off and

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.660 
of stockings by cutting the legs off and
tying<00:04:28.750> them<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.140> knot<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:30.160> helps<00:04:30.520> to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
tying them in a knot and this helps to

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.510 
tying them in a knot and this helps to
trap<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> moisture<00:04:31.630> now<00:04:32.500> if<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:33.040> need<00:04:33.280> to
