00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
but it doesn't matter so you cannot put

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.770 
but it doesn't matter so you cannot put
about<00:00:38.660> um<00:00:39.519> rc-xd<00:00:40.519> s<00:00:40.879> down<00:00:41.239> there<00:00:41.479> I'm<00:00:41.659> pretty

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
about um rc-xd s down there I'm pretty

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.509 
about um rc-xd s down there I'm pretty
sure<00:00:42.049> you're<00:00:42.260> also<00:00:42.409> not<00:00:42.589> allowed<00:00:42.890> for<00:00:43.190> sentry

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
sure you're also not allowed for sentry

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:44.680 
sure you're also not allowed for sentry
guns<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:43.879> Guardians<00:00:44.239> but<00:00:44.449> they're<00:00:44.600> not

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
guns and Guardians but they're not

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.110 
guns and Guardians but they're not
really<00:00:44.839> that<00:00:45.019> useful<00:00:45.199> either<00:00:45.589> any<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.040> them<00:00:46.159> so

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
really that useful either any of them so

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.660 
really that useful either any of them so
yeah<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:50.140> also<00:00:51.140> when<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.710> have<00:00:52.129> ghost<00:00:52.430> on

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
yeah and it also when you have ghost on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.579 
yeah and it also when you have ghost on
in<00:00:52.850> your<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.119> your<00:00:53.150> killstreaks<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:54.229> up<00:00:54.470> you

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
in your in your killstreaks you up you

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.259 
in your in your killstreaks you up you
pause<00:00:54.739> if<00:00:55.040> you're<00:00:55.190> off<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.400> UAV<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.119> is

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
pause if you're off the UAV so this is

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.539 
pause if you're off the UAV so this is
also<00:00:56.479> a<00:00:56.629> good<00:00:56.869> spot<00:00:57.229> for<00:00:57.519> cleaning<00:00:58.519> your

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
also a good spot for cleaning your

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:59.770 
also a good spot for cleaning your
killstreaks<00:00:59.030> because<00:00:59.330> they're<00:00:59.479> not<00:00:59.600> going<00:00:59.720> to

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
killstreaks because they're not going to

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.210 
killstreaks because they're not going to
look<00:01:00.019> back<00:01:00.229> here<00:01:00.500> especially<00:01:00.710> if<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.190> have

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
look back here especially if you have

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.930 
look back here especially if you have
ghosts<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:02.650> there's<00:01:03.650> just<00:01:03.979> another<00:01:04.339> rc-xd

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
ghosts and there's just another rc-xd

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.140 
ghosts and there's just another rc-xd
and<00:01:05.900> then<00:01:06.470> also<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:07.040> care<00:01:07.250> packages<00:01:07.280> but<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
and then also for care packages but the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.860 
and then also for care packages but the
care<00:01:08.330> package<00:01:09.460> they<00:01:10.460> tend<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.119> bounce<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.720> lot

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
care package they tend to bounce a lot

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.940 
care package they tend to bounce a lot
in<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.140> game<00:01:12.410> off<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:13.150> enemies<00:01:14.150> too<00:01:14.620> but<00:01:15.620> when

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
in this game off of enemies too but when

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.260 
in this game off of enemies too but when
you<00:01:16.010> just<00:01:16.190> place<00:01:16.370> them<00:01:16.490> down<00:01:16.610> like<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:17.060> was

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
you just place them down like that was

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.600 
you just place them down like that was
straight<00:01:18.050> to<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> ground<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.890> won<00:01:19.040> like<00:01:19.310> a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
straight to the ground and it won like a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.860 
straight to the ground and it won like a
couple<00:01:20.300> meters<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.520> um<00:01:22.760> you're<00:01:23.660> probably

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
couple meters but um you're probably

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.510 
couple meters but um you're probably
just<00:01:24.140> better<00:01:24.410> off<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.740> put<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.220> bond

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
just better off to put it in this bond

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.180 
just better off to put it in this bond
because<00:01:25.940> there's<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.390> lot<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.600> cover<00:01:27.380> usually

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
because there's a lot of cover usually

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.000 
because there's a lot of cover usually
in<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.580> spawn<00:01:28.940> at<00:01:29.060> least<00:01:29.240> right<00:01:29.540> here<00:01:29.810> but<00:01:30.740> um

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
in the spawn at least right here but um

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.780 
in the spawn at least right here but um
yeah<00:01:32.200> your<00:01:33.200> care<00:01:33.710> packages<00:01:34.190> won't<00:01:34.430> be<00:01:34.580> that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
yeah your care packages won't be that

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.420 
yeah your care packages won't be that
necessary<00:01:35.660> it's<00:01:35.900> just<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.320> fun<00:01:36.800> spot<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.280> go

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
necessary it's just the fun spot to go

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.330 
necessary it's just the fun spot to go
to<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.090> show<00:01:38.120> your<00:01:38.480> friends<00:01:38.690> and
