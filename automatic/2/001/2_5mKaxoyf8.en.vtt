at<00:02:38.270> work<00:02:38.450> when<00:02:38.690> I'm<00:02:38.810> sketching<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.900> this

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
at work when I'm sketching and so this

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.840 
at work when I'm sketching and so this
is<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:46.360> skeleton<00:02:47.360> warrior<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.730> it's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
is like a skeleton warrior you know it's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.020 
is like a skeleton warrior you know it's

got like image of like a helmet so I was

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.490 
got like image of like a helmet so I was
all<00:02:56.150> wrong<00:02:56.330> with<00:02:56.540> that

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.030

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
head and I'll just roughly sketch things

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.170 
head and I'll just roughly sketch things
in<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.260> point<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:12.600> really<00:03:13.600> matter

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
in this point because really matter

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.539 
in this point because really matter
which<00:03:15.780> other<00:03:16.069> chin<00:03:17.579> out<00:03:17.700> later<00:03:19.549> just

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
which other chin out later just

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.420 
which other chin out later just

rather of toothless we've already

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.030 
rather of toothless we've already
established<00:03:23.609> this<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.409> really<00:03:25.409> rough<00:03:25.620> draft

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
established this is a really rough draft

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.259 
established this is a really rough draft
sketch<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.620> can<00:03:28.859> redraw<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.489> necessary<00:03:30.150> on

just<00:03:56.570> sketch<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.710> don't<00:03:57.890> have<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.130> be

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
just sketch in and don't have to be

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.760 
just sketch in and don't have to be
exact<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.780> as<00:03:59.930> you<00:03:59.960> get<00:04:00.200> some<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.620> energy

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
exact so as you get some of the energy

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.800 
exact so as you get some of the energy
in<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.250> sketch<00:04:01.550> you<00:04:02.120> can<00:04:02.300> change<00:04:02.600> things

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
in the sketch you can change things

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:15.430 
in the sketch you can change things
around<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.790> know<00:04:04.910> there

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440

from this bit on there we forget the
arms<00:04:54.560> we've<00:04:55.550> established<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.540> want<00:04:56.840> to
