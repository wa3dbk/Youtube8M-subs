00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.219
 well guys welcome passages in this 

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:05.020
 new video 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.999
 today I present the review of by 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.220
 maria in forma then I want to say that 

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:12.370
 I used it as acts of not like rm 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.380
 therefore, it is therefore some of the pros and cons 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.550
 pros and cons only influenced by 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.320
 this change of role 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.539
 first of all I wanted to address you to 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.730
 link description of tvg where you can 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.030
 buy credits at reduced prices a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.640
 reduced prices are fast 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.699
 cheap and safe, I assure you 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.579
 and there is also the facebook page where 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.960
 they organize very same thorne then 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.120
 go and check 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.249
 then I would say to start I will not not 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.379
 I will give more votes to the states at 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.389
 speed statistics blah blah as I did 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.699
 first because not generalized 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.769
 quite let's say by that not general 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.940
 not generalized enough but not me 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.319
 they liked it very much 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.319
 now I'll just tell you the pro e 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.370
 against what I have found with i 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.359
 various players 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.309
 here then the first against is for sure 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.789
 the speed that I didn't understand very much 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.770
 on paper I see 90 but then also 92 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.409
 of acceleration 92 dispensations of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.869
 springfield on the note paper I see 90 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.060
 but then if I see the statistics they see 92 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.000
 of acceleration 92 this is dispensable 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.250
 they happen to be very sincere 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.520
 from the paper years ago it always has 90 and from 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.649
 paper iv always and in any case 90 I don't have it 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.340
 sincerely, however, I can 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.079
 ensure that 90 and 90 is absurd 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.759
 if not so we combine agility with the 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.369
 balancing to what is yours 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.539
 actual speed for deaf le 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.210
 ride with this player 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.820
 I tell you I 'm the biggest pro e 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.490
 beautiful to go ride and discard 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.679
 all with him because madonna is deadly 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.749
 deadly is one on one 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.670
 the opponent has always been his 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.649
 second dribbling and sissoko 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.859
 his second pro is dribbling 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.530
 dribbling we see a 90 of dribbling 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:05.200
 actual and 89 ball control 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.320
 if we talk about dribbling we talk about a 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.400
 player that the man skips it and a lot 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.170
 easily 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.090
 we also see four-star screen e 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 then 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.709
 even with the addition of some skills 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.989
 if necessary the player skips it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.400
 also because I take it very fast 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.620
 example they did not have it for him was a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.440
 year ciop does it quickly i am the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.019
 closed skill more practically and it does 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.459
 quickly besides the fact that the whole 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.040
 rest of the skill does it quickly 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.349
 because he is a fast player , I have to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.959
 I still don't know, I think, I think 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.900
 understand, so here is the second pro 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.299
 dribbling speed and against the ball 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.290
 while the first one however as I have already said e 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:50.760
 speed and agility 94 trip you are 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.010
 really agile in dribbling I put 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 therefore the 4 star schools schemes therefore 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 Shooting speed and dribbling speed city 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.540
 pro a su absolute of di maria third pro 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.910
 instead it is the power of rho then then 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:12.239
 on the card I see 95 and 95 to the boys 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.840
 absurd, a left-handed shot 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.049
 hallucinating hallucinating I must not say 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.510
 other in front of the door among other things is 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.579
 this the other one for the finalization e 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.190
 deadly because he never makes mistakes 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.920
 I never make mistakes, but it's not that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.160
 address I click and shoot very tightly 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.930
 I didn't understand it, but it's a pro 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.840
 even if I don't understand a pro then 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.739
 that of the finalization and of the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.340
 shooting power is good the only thing is a 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.209
 the precision of the long shot 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.530
 I see, however, very often long shots 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.709
 they are very powerful yes but they are a lot 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.459
 inaccurate 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:00.959
 I would say a lot because it is not a throw 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.290
 on the workshop on 6 enter a nice long shot 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.760
 long shot therefore enters against I would say long 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.500
 shot though 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.420
 as stated on the card 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.120
 because if I had seen a 75 I didn't 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.069
 I would be surprised, I wouldn't be there 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.480
 astonished 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.310
 in short, even if it goes well we can 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.000
 in short, put it as no 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.250
 then we have the positioning in the area 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.199
 goal this is one of his cons and gods 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.330
 his pros because he has a positioning 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.130
 of shit because of his warcraft though 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.669
 is always in the right place at the moment 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.680
 quite right 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:40.979
 almost like a real swear attacker 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:45.330
 and is always always in the goal area e 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:49.770
 this is an hour we pass encounter is one 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.530
 the nonsense of maria is the fact 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.930
 that he is always out of role then 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:01.530
 this is because warcraft aid 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.050
 but when I don't know, I turn to 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.449
 right to give him that he is almost there 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.560
 this is never this thing to break me 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:13.080
 quite the balls as it could 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.419
 break the fuck you all like and is 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.340
 great because the drives for a and of are 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.490
 I worked past mostly I don't know 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.900
 in a 3 5 2 they are absurd though if I do 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.419
 use as deeds I want him 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.479
 be attacked and not just come back e 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:30.539
 so this is 111 against quiet 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.760
 though that if you are both tenare anyway 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.120
 faith in the goal area and that is when he 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.410
 instead you want to set the maneuver him 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.120
 you will find it so you will find it and me 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.130
 I say already and then one against 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.310
 just the world trade and always 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.320
 out of position the other against the two 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.529
 weak foot stars on the right sucks 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.509
 but it is not so much 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.479
 meeting because he is an ati of yes 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.520
 center and pull as I usually do 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:04.669
 and then instead the other against and last is 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.289
 the strength is a distant 80 65 I'd be 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.059
 waited a little more from the 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:14.610
 strength is very easy to lose to 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:16.289
 balloon in a very easy fight that 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.629
 loses a ball in its own one 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:21.240
 shoulder to shoulder, unfortunately though 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.839
 oh well these are the pros and cons 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.180
 di di maria I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.949
 this review I urge you to leave 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.409
 a nice I like a nice comment and tell me 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:35.400
 what do you think if you tried it costs 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:38.460
 I paid him about 290 milan, 270 thousand 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.490
 and resold a day later at 290,000 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.349
 so I made the deal there 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.310
 earned about 10,000 credits and indeed 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:48.210
 I sold it 295,000 I did 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.669
 the deal 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.080
 I urge you to leave a like if 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:57.899
 we arrive at 159 130 I like it or 120 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.669
 in short to bring out the review of 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:03.990
 pedro ii cheeses to clips but already already 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.939
 tomorrow 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.990
 I am flash together and refer you to 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.990
