be the guy to make peace and that's when
I<00:01:43.560> thought<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.490> naruto<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> be

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
I thought that naruto was going to be

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.210 
I thought that naruto was going to be
not<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> won't<00:01:47.909> say<00:01:48.060> tsunade's<00:01:48.689> um<00:01:49.220> person

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
why I think when Tsunade thought she

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
why I think when Tsunade thought she
could<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.170> hope<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:59.430> naruto<00:01:59.790> or

could put more hope into naruto or

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.050 
could put more hope into naruto or
decide<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> naruto<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> good<00:02:01.979> person<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
decide that naruto was a good person to

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
come to conclusion that hey maybe

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.940 
come to conclusion that hey maybe
Tsunade<00:03:40.940> could<00:03:41.300> have<00:03:41.390> killed<00:03:41.660> then<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:42.170> don't

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
Tsunade could have killed then I don't

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.970 
Tsunade could have killed then I don't
know<00:03:43.040> I'm<00:03:43.310> not<00:03:43.400> sure<00:03:43.459> because<00:03:43.850> any<00:03:44.330> manga<00:03:44.980> dan

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
know I'm not sure because any manga dan

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.640 
know I'm not sure because any manga dan
did<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.430> fact<00:03:46.640> helps<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.209> not<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.440> don't

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
did in fact helps you not it so I don't

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.070 
did in fact helps you not it so I don't
think<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:49.010> was<00:03:49.160> his<00:03:49.700> fault<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.600> like<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.959> said

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
think it was his fault so like I said

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.289 
think it was his fault so like I said
that<00:03:51.380> was<00:03:51.560> spoiler<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:52.549> don't<00:03:52.850> think<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
that was spoiler so I don't think I

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.970 
that was spoiler so I don't think I
don't<00:03:53.420> think<00:03:53.570> Tsunade<00:03:54.080> kill<00:03:54.500> Ben<00:03:54.799> because

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
don't think Tsunade kill Ben because

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.000 
don't think Tsunade kill Ben because
then<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.970> me<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.660> would<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.810> like<00:03:56.950> that'd<00:03:57.950> be

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
then to me that would be like that'd be

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.199 
then to me that would be like that'd be
like<00:03:58.130> someone<00:03:58.400> killing<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:58.850> be<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:59.030> oh

yeah you finally killed me know is that
something<00:04:01.280> happy<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.820> do<00:04:01.970> think<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.420> I

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
something happy so I do think that I

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.140 
something happy so I do think that I
don't<00:04:03.799> think<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.160> she<00:04:04.549> killed<00:04:04.760> him<00:04:04.910> but

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
don't think that she killed him but

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.449 
don't think that she killed him but
maybe<00:04:05.720> she's<00:04:06.380> trying<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.620> help<00:04:06.920> him<00:04:07.160> somehow

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
maybe she's trying to help him somehow

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.729 
maybe she's trying to help him somehow
i'm<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:07.730> sure<00:04:08.090> how<00:04:08.540> exactly<00:04:08.720> i<00:04:09.230> don't<00:04:09.590> think

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
i'm not sure how exactly i don't think

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.460 
i'm not sure how exactly i don't think
she<00:04:10.010> killed<00:04:10.190> him<00:04:10.370> so<00:04:11.120> that's<00:04:11.959> one<00:04:12.200> thing<00:04:12.350> I'm

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
she killed him so that's one thing I'm

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.810 
she killed him so that's one thing I'm
really<00:04:12.500> getting<00:04:12.920> from<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.580> says

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
really getting from this and it says

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.340 
really getting from this and it says
things<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.150> can't<00:04:14.360> get<00:04:14.480> back<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:15.019> I'm

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
things you can't get back so I'm

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.199 
things you can't get back so I'm
guessing<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:16.100> test<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.549> revolve<00:04:16.880> more

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
guessing this test to revolve more

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.740 
guessing this test to revolve more
around<00:04:18.070> tsunade<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.280> her<00:04:20.000> relationship<00:04:20.720> with

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
around tsunade and her relationship with

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.390 
around tsunade and her relationship with
Dan<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.260> think<00:04:21.440> we're<00:04:21.530> gonna<00:04:21.620> see<00:04:21.799> similar<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
Dan I think we're gonna see similar to a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.219 
Dan I think we're gonna see similar to a
flashback<00:04:22.849> not<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> flashback<00:04:23.570> but<00:04:23.810> um<00:04:23.930> yeah

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
it's basically a flashback what they

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.730 
it's basically a flashback what they
mean

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
mean

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.460

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
killer so it seems tomorrow somewhere

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.659 
killer so it seems tomorrow somewhere
around<00:04:28.560> there<00:04:28.860> we're<00:04:29.039> gonna<00:04:29.130> see<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> little

maybe you'll see a nice little luck I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.080 
maybe you'll see a nice little luck I
guess<00:04:42.900> preview<00:04:43.710> after<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.280> one<00:04:44.490> or<00:04:44.669> when<00:04:45.060> I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
guess preview after this one or when I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.779 
guess preview after this one or when I
fat<00:04:45.419> or<00:04:45.690> whenever<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.349> Schmo<00:04:46.770> besides<00:04:47.069> not<00:04:47.400> stop

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
fat or whenever a Schmo besides not stop

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.730 
fat or whenever a Schmo besides not stop
making<00:04:48.090> fillers<00:04:48.389> but<00:04:48.690> i<00:04:48.720> wonder<00:04:49.139> how<00:04:49.470> look

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
making fillers but i wonder how look

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.850 
making fillers but i wonder how look
like<00:04:49.949> filler<00:04:50.520> ratio<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.840> actual<00:04:52.380> episodes

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
like filler ratio is the actual episodes

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.430 
like filler ratio is the actual episodes
ratio<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.789> know<00:04:53.880> cuz<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.690> me<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:55.080> kind<00:04:55.139> of

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
ratio you know cuz to me it kind of

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.170 
ratio you know cuz to me it kind of
feels<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.949> if<00:04:56.280> there<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> lot<00:04:56.789> of<00:04:56.819> fillers

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
feels as if there are a lot of fillers

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.270 
feels as if there are a lot of fillers
like<00:04:57.419> there<00:04:57.630> are<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.720> lot<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.080> fillers<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.710> um

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
like there are a lot of fillers that um

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.010 
like there are a lot of fillers that um
i<00:04:59.460> guess<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.880> were<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.210> add<00:05:00.330> up<00:05:00.539> it'd<00:05:00.720> be<00:05:00.870> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
i guess you were to add up it'd be the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.439 
i guess you were to add up it'd be the
equivalent<00:05:01.340> actually<00:05:02.340> not<00:05:02.819> even<00:05:02.849> equivalent

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
equivalent actually not even equivalent

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.059 
equivalent actually not even equivalent
it's<00:05:03.659> somewhere<00:05:04.139> around<00:05:04.199> give<00:05:04.740> or<00:05:04.889> take

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
it's somewhere around give or take

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.850 
it's somewhere around give or take
equivalent<00:05:06.060> equates<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.289> same<00:05:07.530> exact

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
equivalent equates to the same exact

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.320 
equivalent equates to the same exact
amount<00:05:08.069> of<00:05:08.159> actual<00:05:08.370> episode<00:05:08.849> i'm<00:05:09.150> not<00:05:09.240> sure

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
amount of actual episode i'm not sure

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
amount of actual episode i'm not sure
how<00:05:09.720> much<00:05:09.870> exactly<00:05:10.110> maybe<00:05:10.500> i'll<00:05:10.650> come<00:05:10.830> up<00:05:11.009> on

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
how much exactly maybe i'll come up on

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.950 
how much exactly maybe i'll come up on
board<00:05:11.460> or<00:05:11.550> something<00:05:11.639> i<00:05:11.880> don't<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.150> but<00:05:12.810> um
