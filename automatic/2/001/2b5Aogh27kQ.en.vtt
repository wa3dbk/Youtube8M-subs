basically have a new eternal infernal

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.839 
basically have a new eternal infernal
tower<00:00:11.639> level<00:00:12.090> 3<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.099> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.250> when<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.549> first

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
tower level 3 and you know when I first

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.060 
tower level 3 and you know when I first
saw<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.020> clash<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> clans<00:00:16.560> Facebook

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
saw that on the clash of clans Facebook

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.390 
saw that on the clash of clans Facebook
page<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.490> look<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.880> some<00:00:18.119> fanart<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:19.400> it

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
page you look like some fanart but it

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.170 
page you look like some fanart but it
seemed<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.029> looks<00:00:21.300> legit<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:22.820> they<00:00:23.820> have

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
seemed it looks legit now they they have

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.529 
seemed it looks legit now they they have
it<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.490> multiple<00:00:26.490> enemies<00:00:27.029> will<00:00:27.390> be

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it so that multiple enemies will be

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
it so that multiple enemies will be
attacked<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.820> now<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.029> that's

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
attacked this time now I think that's

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290 
attacked this time now I think that's
good<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:31.399> if<00:00:32.399> golems<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.180> your

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
good because if golems can get in your

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
good because if golems can get in your
base<00:00:33.450> then<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.260> over<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
base then it's a game over so with this

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.780 
base then it's a game over so with this
thing<00:00:36.390> maybe<00:00:36.840> it'll<00:00:37.710> lock<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.399> going

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
thing maybe it'll lock on to going

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
thing maybe it'll lock on to going
faster<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:40.050> did<00:00:40.290> mention<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.309> comments

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
faster they did mention in the comments

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.420 
faster they did mention in the comments
that<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.469> too

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that it's not going to be too

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.090 
that it's not going to be too
overpowered<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> damage<00:00:46.950> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
overpowered where you know the damage is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.470 
overpowered where you know the damage is
gonna<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:49.489> how<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> usually<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.030> they

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
gonna just be how it usually is they

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
gonna just be how it usually is they
said<00:00:51.690> they're<00:00:51.870> gonna<00:00:52.129> nerf<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.340> damage<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
said they're gonna nerf the damage a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.930 
said they're gonna nerf the damage a
little<00:00:54.059> bit<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:56.070> might<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.430> charge

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
little bit so that it might only charge

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.250 
little bit so that it might only charge
up<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:58.070> second<00:00:59.070> level<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.989> mean<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
up to a second level because I mean it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.850 
up to a second level because I mean it
might<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.879> people<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.899> win

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
might be too much for people to win

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
might be too much for people to win
victories<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> strong<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
victories if it's just that strong so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840 
victories if it's just that strong so
they<00:01:07.500> did<00:01:07.710> mention<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
they did mention that they are going to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
they did mention that they are going to
nurse<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.600> infernal<00:01:10.409> tower<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
nurse the infernal tower so that's it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420 
nurse the infernal tower so that's it
doesn't<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.030> damage<00:01:13.220> which<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
doesn't do as much damage which is a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.190 
doesn't do as much damage which is a
good<00:01:14.700> thing<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:15.720> only<00:01:16.049> gripe<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.740> is

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
good thing my only gripe right now is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
good thing my only gripe right now is
the<00:01:19.200> infernal<00:01:19.710> towers<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:21.509> can

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the infernal towers as they are they can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.940 
the infernal towers as they are they can
only<00:01:21.990> hold<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.500> believe<00:01:22.770> 600<00:01:23.310> dark<00:01:23.490> elixir<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
only hold I believe 600 dark elixir and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
only hold I believe 600 dark elixir and
usually<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.909> someone<00:01:27.330> attacks<00:01:27.689> your

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
usually if you if someone attacks your

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.190 
usually if you if someone attacks your
base<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:29.340> win<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:30.390> you're<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.960> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
base and you win if you're not back in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.950 
base and you win if you're not back in
time<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> refill<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:33.210> infernal<00:01:33.509> towers

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
time to refill your your infernal towers

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
time to refill your your infernal towers
then<00:01:34.259> you're<00:01:34.950> gonna<00:01:35.040> lose<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> next<00:01:35.640> battle

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
then you're gonna lose the next battle

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
then you're gonna lose the next battle
because<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.420> Inferno<00:01:36.720> towers<00:01:37.170> burn<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.799> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
because your Inferno towers burn up that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.179 
because your Inferno towers burn up that
dark<00:01:38.310> elixir<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.970> fast<00:01:39.590> mine<00:01:40.590> right<00:01:41.159> now

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
dark elixir really fast mine right now

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
dark elixir really fast mine right now
they<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.729> probably<00:01:41.909> last<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> battle<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
they could probably last the battle and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
they could probably last the battle and
then<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> next<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.979> they're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
then the next one you know they're

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
then the next one you know they're
guaranteed<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> win<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.619> don't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
guaranteed to win because I just don't

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.789 
guaranteed to win because I just don't
have<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.420> capacity<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.509> my<00:01:48.799> infernal

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
have in the capacity in my infernal

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
have in the capacity in my infernal
tower<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.180> should<00:01:51.420> do

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
tower so I think what they should do

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
tower so I think what they should do
hopefully

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hopefully

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
hopefully
with<00:01:54.539> this<00:01:54.689> new<00:01:54.960> upgrade<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:56.429> should

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
with this new upgrade is they should

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 
with this new upgrade is they should
raise<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.920> capacity<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> higher<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
raise the capacity to higher so that it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
raise the capacity to higher so that it
could<00:02:00.030> last<00:02:00.240> maybe<00:02:00.509> three<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.899> four<00:02:01.020> battles

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
could last maybe three or four battles

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
could last maybe three or four battles
that<00:02:02.429> would<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:02.909> that's<00:02:03.329> what<00:02:03.539> I<00:02:03.570> would

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
that would be good that's what I would

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.050 
that would be good that's what I would
look<00:02:03.929> for<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> hopefully<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.399> implement

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
look for and hopefully they implement
