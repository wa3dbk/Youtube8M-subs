people have been playing in that and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.260 
people have been playing in that and
it's<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> middle<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> road

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's kind of the middle of the road

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's kind of the middle of the road
Titan<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> most<00:00:49.620> strong<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.760> terms

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
Titan it's not the most strong in terms

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
Titan it's not the most strong in terms
of<00:00:51.120> firepower<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> armor<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
of firepower and armor and it's not the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
of firepower and armor and it's not the
most<00:00:53.039> mobile<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
most mobile but it's kind of a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
most mobile but it's kind of a
middle-of-the-road<00:00:54.860> equal<00:00:55.860> balance<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.489> all

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
middle-of-the-road equal balance of all

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
middle-of-the-road equal balance of all
the<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.149> stats<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> thing

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the kind of stats and that kind of thing

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
the kind of stats and that kind of thing
so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> feel<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.270> quite

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that whole element of gameplay but the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
that whole element of gameplay but the
other<00:01:10.710> two<00:01:10.920> signs<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.090> much<00:01:12.330> more

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
other two signs are actually much more

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270

interesting<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.110> my<00:01:13.140> opinion<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> second

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
interesting in my opinion so the second

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
interesting in my opinion so the second
time<00:01:14.400> we<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.450> ogre<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.930> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
time we know about is the ogre and this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
time we know about is the ogre and this
is<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> tank<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.070> Beast<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
is really the tank the Beast of the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
is really the tank the Beast of the
titans<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.869> deals<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.290> heavy<00:01:19.530> amount<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.950> damage

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
titans it deals a heavy amount of damage

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
titans it deals a heavy amount of damage
has<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.420> very<00:01:21.780> thick<00:01:21.900> armor<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.040> you'll

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.320 
be able to take a lot of damage but of
course<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.040> comes<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> price<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
course that comes at a price and you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.319 
course that comes at a price and you
will<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.689> heavily<00:01:28.320> reduced<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.070> mobility<00:01:29.460> now

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
will be heavily reduced in mobility now

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.940 
will be heavily reduced in mobility now
I<00:01:30.600> think<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> suit<00:01:31.560> quite<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
I think this is going to suit quite a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
I think this is going to suit quite a
defensive<00:01:32.520> play<00:01:32.790> style<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:34.079> my<00:01:34.259> style

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
defensive play style not really my style

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920 
defensive play style not really my style
personally<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> might<00:01:35.790> cater<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.810> way

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
personally but it might cater to the way

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.289 
personally but it might cater to the way
you<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> play<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> time<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.070> game

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
you want to play in a time in this game

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
you want to play in a time in this game
because<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.720> ogre<00:01:40.079> whilst<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
because the ogre whilst it is going to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.469 
because the ogre whilst it is going to
enable<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> romp<00:01:42.150> around<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
enable you to kind of romp around the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.880 
enable you to kind of romp around the
map<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> destroy<00:01:43.140> everything<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.649> path

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
map and destroy everything in your path

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.850 
map and destroy everything in your path
you<00:01:44.490> will<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.759> quite<00:01:45.000> vulnerable<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.840> both<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you will be quite vulnerable to both the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
you will be quite vulnerable to both the
more<00:01:47.070> mobile<00:01:47.399> Titans<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> course<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
more mobile Titans and of course the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
more mobile Titans and of course the
pilots<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.200> their<00:01:49.350> anti<00:01:49.590> tine<00:01:49.770> weapons<00:01:50.220> one

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
pilots with their anti tine weapons one

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
pilots with their anti tine weapons one
of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> most<00:01:51.119> vulnerable<00:01:51.390> aspects<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of the most vulnerable aspects of this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
of the most vulnerable aspects of this
Titan<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.770> opinion<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.340> pilots<00:01:53.970> are

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
Titan in my opinion is that pilots are

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.520 
Titan in my opinion is that pilots are
actually<00:01:54.360> able<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> jump<00:01:55.020> onto<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> back<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
actually able to jump onto the back of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
actually able to jump onto the back of
your<00:01:55.680> time<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.369> dealing<00:01:56.549> damage<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.149> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
your time and start dealing damage to it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
your time and start dealing damage to it
whilst<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.259> riding<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.829> top<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
whilst kind of riding on top of you and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
whilst kind of riding on top of you and
unless<00:01:59.759> there's<00:02:00.210> some<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.630> teammates<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
unless there's some of your teammates to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
unless there's some of your teammates to
shoot<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.829> pilot<00:02:02.310> off<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:03.240> kind<00:02:03.509> of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
shoot that pilot off your kind of

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
shoot that pilot off your kind of
defenseless<00:02:03.960> against<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.399> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
defenseless against it so I think that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
defenseless against it so I think that
is<00:02:05.670> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.090> weakness<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> ogre<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.439> is

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
is kind of a weakness to the ogre it is

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
is kind of a weakness to the ogre it is
going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.920> quite<00:02:08.099> easy<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> enemy<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
going to be quite easy for the enemy to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.699 
going to be quite easy for the enemy to
outmaneuver<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.869> whilst<00:02:10.110> you're<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.500> this

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
outmaneuver you whilst you're in this

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.170 
outmaneuver you whilst you're in this
however<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.400> do<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> ogre

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
however we do know that the ogre

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.760 
however we do know that the ogre
actually<00:02:12.420> has<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.959> awesome<00:02:13.230> space

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
actually has a really awesome space

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
actually has a really awesome space
ability<00:02:14.160> where<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.520> rip<00:02:14.820> off<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> arm<00:02:15.210> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
ability where it can rip off the arm of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.450 
ability where it can rip off the arm of
an<00:02:15.630> enemy<00:02:15.750> Titan<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.320> then<00:02:16.500> beat<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.190> time

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
an enemy Titan and then beat that time

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.010 
an enemy Titan and then beat that time
to<00:02:17.670> death<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.060> its<00:02:18.240> own<00:02:18.450> arm<00:02:18.690> which<00:02:18.870> is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
to death with its own arm which is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.960 
to death with its own arm which is
freaking<00:02:19.380> cool<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.920> can't<00:02:20.490> wait<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.940> that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
freaking cool I can't wait to do that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.490 
freaking cool I can't wait to do that
and<00:02:21.330> last<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:21.720> not<00:02:21.900> least<00:02:21.960> we<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
and last but not least we have the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560 
and last but not least we have the
Strider<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.520> we've<00:02:23.640> got<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> ogre<00:02:24.090> which<00:02:24.420> is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
Strider so we've got the ogre which is

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.270 
Strider so we've got the ogre which is
kind<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.870> tank<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.470> we've<00:02:25.710> got<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> Atlas

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
kind of a tank and we've got the Atlas

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.610 
kind of a tank and we've got the Atlas
which<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.580> kind<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.030> equal<00:02:27.750> balance<00:02:27.990> type

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
which is kind of a equal balance type

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620 
which is kind of a equal balance type
Titan<00:02:29.040> we've<00:02:29.580> got<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.880> course<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.360> one

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
Titan we've got to of course have one

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.110 
Titan we've got to of course have one
that<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:30.960> very<00:02:31.290> mobile<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.130> weaker<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that is very mobile but weaker and this

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.790 
that is very mobile but weaker and this
is<00:02:33.240> where<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> Strider<00:02:33.690> comes<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.500> it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
is where the Strider comes in so it's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.440 
is where the Strider comes in so it's
the<00:02:35.010> most<00:02:35.160> mobile<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.700> all<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.910> Titans<00:02:36.240> can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the most mobile of all the Titans can

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.720 
the most mobile of all the Titans can
easily<00:02:36.900> outrun<00:02:36.930> them<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.590> pace<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.460> dodge

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
easily outrun them in pace can dodge

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.490 
easily outrun them in pace can dodge
from<00:02:38.970> side<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> side<00:02:39.360> which<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.290> going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> be

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
from side to side which is going to be

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.110 
from side to side which is going to be
really<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.160> advantageous<00:02:41.520> when<00:02:41.910> you've

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
really really advantageous when you've

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
really really advantageous when you've
got<00:02:42.270> pilots<00:02:42.720> trying<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.990> shoot<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
got pilots trying to shoot you with the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.290 
got pilots trying to shoot you with the
big<00:02:44.100> rocket<00:02:44.520> launchers<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.060> kind<00:02:45.270> of

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
big rocket launchers and that kind of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.730 
big rocket launchers and that kind of
thing<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.570> should<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:45.990> able<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> rocket

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
thing you should be able to see a rocket

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.070 
thing you should be able to see a rocket
coming<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.100> perhaps<00:02:47.190> dodge<00:02:47.490> out<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> way

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
coming and perhaps dodge out of the way

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.990 
coming and perhaps dodge out of the way
which<00:02:49.080> makes<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> very<00:02:49.860> very<00:02:50.370> agile<00:02:50.760> time

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
which makes this a very very agile time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.360 
which makes this a very very agile time
obviously<00:02:51.630> again<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.960> comes<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.320> cost<00:02:52.500> it's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
obviously again it comes at a cost it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.630 
obviously again it comes at a cost it's
got<00:02:53.550> basically<00:02:54.150> no<00:02:54.510> armor<00:02:54.930> at<00:02:55.140> all<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.190> are

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
got basically no armor at all so you are

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.800 
got basically no armor at all so you are
not<00:02:56.820> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.090> able<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.270> take<00:02:57.420> very<00:02:57.630> much

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
not going to be able to take very much

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.450 
not going to be able to take very much
damage<00:02:58.140> we<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.500> play<00:02:58.650> very<00:02:58.890> very<00:02:59.040> smart

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
damage we have to play very very smart

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.700 
damage we have to play very very smart
and<00:02:59.790> very<00:02:59.850> very<00:03:00.180> fast-paced<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.440> time<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
and very very fast-paced in this time I

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.080 
and very very fast-paced in this time I
think<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.160> gonna<00:03:02.310> sue<00:03:02.490> my<00:03:02.700> play<00:03:02.910> style

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
think this is gonna sue my play style

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.790 
think this is gonna sue my play style
perfectly<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.260> stride<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.740> to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
perfectly I think the stride is going to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.500 
perfectly I think the stride is going to
be<00:03:04.890> my<00:03:05.040> favorite<00:03:05.490> let<00:03:05.910> me<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.390> want
