00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.960
 good morning it is today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.670
 February 23 I go to the hair salon 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 arkel this afternoon 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.049
 and then they look beautiful on my hair 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 I first have to do a little touring 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.800
 sides of the basket because of mine 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 She really was n't fed up with it this afternoon 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.779
 crops do not have to wash 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 so that's why the crazy thing about head 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 so I'm going a bit further today 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 vlogging i'm going with my larger camera 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 make videos and photos and so I go 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.350
 arms do not record what they are going to do 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.640
 in every detail but it is just that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.950
 it is clear what happens 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.559
 avon article my pennies a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 about the beds and then I go 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 towards the cotton 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 so i bring my softboxes and my 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.100
 camera in my vlog camera and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 and what I hear appeared so I go 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.120
 do it now 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 the perfume that is worn today from 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.469
 also short return and this is really a whole 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 fine perfume if you get a bit of it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 sweetish floral wood and I like this 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.189
 also takes you a little bit on the little finger 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 seem like ribbon so I'm going to ask these questions 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.659
 and furthermore I am in love with one 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.740
 number and ecology and then you walk you pay attention 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.740
 so do click 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.790
 no and this one so dead 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.689
 she is 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.610
 ok I arrived at the salon and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.230
 it's five past one so I'm used to it 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.060
 very on time 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.890
 I don't see anyone inside yet but I'm going 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.680
 see if the door is open and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.480
 then I will just unpack everything because 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.330
 behind this are soft boxes on the right 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.729
 my camera bag and my own bag 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.610
 so I now go to total look want 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.400
 maybe your eyes can see and reach 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.560
 or know can see exactly say so 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.410
 Behind that gray car is the shock troops 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.820
 so I'll take you with me today and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.619
 so you are going to see a number of things 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 and that becomes so every month 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.950
 recorded so I am very curious 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.140
 how everything is going to be and what they all are 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.610
 for planning what it hears is very 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.610
 fast so I'll see you soon 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
 lotte first started with 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.470
 make syrups in my hair and good 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.570
 separation and dividing hair such that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.400
 dyeing is easier 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.200
 and it went out first say not the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 dye green but really the 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.300
 warmest color on top of my hair settings 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.610
 really just pretty fierce 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.380
 after this color was used very nicely 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.350
 between butt colors that first again 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.040
 crops and roads wrong and then it became 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.410
 again 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 bleached edge first had to all glow and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.610
 copper really shine from my 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.310
 her are before they say the basic 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.930
 actually use hair dye 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.430
 So this we solve this with a tank 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.260
 those she who I would always be very nice 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.120
 already tangled up with tangles and hair 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.280
 pain that use too recently and me 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.930
 actually want to mix everything more then me 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.060
 just under the hair dryer you have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.650
 actually just time for yourself 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.209
 the team went off and that became more 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.860
 blow-dried as you see it is a whole 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.420
 much lighter so t is very good 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.760
 used but as you can see are above 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 worries on dark strips and that has 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.549
 actually fought again 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.080
 have to paint 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.090
 they still needed something 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.580
 become lighter because otherwise be with again 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.470
 put the same effect so this was a moment 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.510
 the middle result as you can 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.340
 see it is really a whole lot lighter 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.890
 and it really is that I have a wig on 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.750
 I often feel that it is just that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.010
 is happy already happy a lot lighter 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.900
 be like you here at the front 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.069
 There are still dark picks and this 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.909
 must is odd 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.260
 be uncoloured again after twice 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.360
 this was the result 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.980
 become heavy we take you away from 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.480
 here they could say the brown one 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.480
 apply hair dye 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.599
 now it's time for the final part 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.280
 and that is the brown color and then hope 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.690
 that it immediately falls into a good and 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.340
 dogs first we got the divorce because of that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.409
 the light was discolored from the mine 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.700
 own outgrowth was therefore allowed 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.079
 sit for a while 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.129
 so they first fully deployed this 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.129
 and then the rest of her 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.459
 college fought everything well massaged 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.440
 because of course you are not allowed a tuft 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.419
 because otherwise you have a tan and 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.709
 I need a guts so her view everything 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.139
 well massaged 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:33.500
 and occasionally wait 35 minutes for it 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:35.570
 result after 35 minutes of waiting 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.460
 finally time to get rid of my paint 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.289
 I started rinsing and I was so awful 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.910
 curious about the result and because 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.190
 everything had caught and because none 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910
 more color difference and see that 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.680
 whoever 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.349
 indeed soon come to that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240
 for a real one and I thought it was that way 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.030
 nice with you really got a delicious one 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.750
 head massage and neck massage with all 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.820
 delicious products from l'oréal my hair 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.979
 really wash then get some good ones 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.080
 receive care and immediately 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.830
 two loyal products taken to 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.720
 House 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.760
 This is a creatine treatment that is 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.560
 striking for the hair and also gives 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.050
 just again and that very beautiful shine 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.030
 and that the heart looks good again 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.530
 Change my heart has such blow 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.449
 had if more than dog is natural 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.050
 twice completely discolored and still 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.050
 once the paint 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.789
 and maybe I am lucky too 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.080
 I had never previously app 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.889
 discolored 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.990
 I once got some delicious 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.059
 neck massage head massage as you see 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.059
 and all the enjoyment was really delicious 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:59.069
 now fate is taking the mask off 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.139
 l'oréal and this is very good as 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.149
 you have indeed discolored your hair or you 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.189
 her has been a big blow with 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.419
 paint or something of discoloration or 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.680
 bleaching 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.629
 this is a very nice product 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.999
 striking for your hair and it gives 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.490
 really a nice boost for your hair 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:15.990
 point also because I had no problems in 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.249
 my hair soft and certainly not look like 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.099
 ropes because the softness just completely 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.990
 good if you put this mask in 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.569
 you can also choose a blue or 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.580
 warm towel around your head 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.930
 this will let you sit for 5 minutes and 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.499
 after that you can roon your hair again 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.499
 rinse 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.830
 These are the two products that come with me 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.270
 have been used and that I also just at home 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.130
 further testing 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.230
 they are very fine products from 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.310
 l'oréal and yes they just really represent 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.050
 a delicious one 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.820
 glow and a boost and you can do it too 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.960
 fruit and your hair certainly does not look 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.340
 bad even after three 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.760
 treatments like you will be with me later 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.760
 can see 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.509
 then it will be the dots on the 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.460
 I put my hair because I had to go 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.800
 be patient for the photo from before 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.710
 and after and I was so very happy 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:05.099
 that my hair didn't look crazy I was 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.379
 Canary yellow and blonde and copper and red 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.930

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.580
