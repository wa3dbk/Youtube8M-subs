hi<00:00:00.390> I'm<00:00:00.900> Steve<00:00:01.199> Jones<00:00:01.230> and<00:00:01.620> I'm<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:02.010> tell

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.530 
hi I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to tell
you<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.399> little<00:00:02.639> bit<00:00:02.730> about<00:00:02.850> three-phase

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
you a little bit about three-phase

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.470 
you a little bit about three-phase
electricity<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.440> why<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:04.799> use<00:00:04.830> it<00:00:05.279> well<00:00:06.299> in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
electricity and why we use it well in

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.009 
electricity and why we use it well in
your<00:00:06.899> home<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.500> don't<00:00:07.770> use<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.940> use

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
your home you don't use it you use

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.419 
your home you don't use it you use
single-phase<00:00:10.019> electricity<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.400> use

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
single-phase electricity you use

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.330 
single-phase electricity you use
electricity<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:13.049> people<00:00:13.440> will<00:00:13.590> draw<00:00:13.889> like

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
electricity which people will draw like

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660 
electricity which people will draw like
that<00:00:14.780> that<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.260> alternating<00:00:16.859> current

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that that is it's alternating current

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.790 
that that is it's alternating current
and<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.570> current<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:18.990> backwards<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
and the current is going backwards and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.870 
and the current is going backwards and
forwards<00:00:20.570> now<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.020> build<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.769> generator<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
forwards now if you build a generator to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.380 
forwards now if you build a generator to
generate<00:00:24.619> single-phase<00:00:25.619> electricity<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
generate single-phase electricity it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.710

point you're generating electricity at

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
point you're generating electricity at
this<00:00:37.800> point<00:00:38.100> you're<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> poor<00:00:39.660> old

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this point you're not so the poor old

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
this point you're not so the poor old
machine<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.469> generating<00:00:41.340> they're<00:00:41.550> not

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
machine is generating they're not

machine is generating they're not
generating<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.649> shakes<00:00:44.070> like

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
generating a lot and it shakes like

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.500 
generating a lot and it shakes like
crazy<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.800> idea<00:00:47.300> if<00:00:48.300> you're

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
crazy that is not a good idea if you're

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.939 
crazy that is not a good idea if you're
very<00:00:48.690> cunning<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.250> arrange<00:00:50.870> three

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
very cunning and you arrange three

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
very cunning and you arrange three
electric<00:00:52.949> generators<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> connect<00:00:54.809> them

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
electric generators and connect them

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.389 
electric generators and connect them
together<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.090> generate<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.399> for

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
together you will generate like this for

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.549 
together you will generate like this for
one<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.820> them<00:01:00.030> you'll<00:01:00.510> generate<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
one of them you'll generate like that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250 
one of them you'll generate like that
for<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> next<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:03.030> generating<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
for the next you're generating like this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
for the next you're generating like this
and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.890> next<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.460> generating<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and the next you're generating like this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.649 
and the next you're generating like this
and<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:07.740> any<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> machine<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.340> doing<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and at any time the machine is doing the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.039 
and at any time the machine is doing the
same<00:01:13.020> amount<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.979> work<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.119> fact<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> doing

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
same amount of work in fact is doing

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.010 
same amount of work in fact is doing
nothing<00:01:16.460> essentially<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.840> these

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
nothing essentially because for these

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
nothing essentially because for these
two<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.680> pushing<00:01:20.280> power<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.659> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
two it's pushing power in this one is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.070 
two it's pushing power in this one is
pulling<00:01:22.170> power<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.369> overall<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
pulling power out so overall there is a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.640 
pulling power out so overall there is a
balance<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.770> power<00:01:26.340> being<00:01:26.970> generated<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
balance of power being generated so the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
balance of power being generated so the
generator<00:01:29.189> instead<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> pushing<00:01:30.930> electricity

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
generator instead of pushing electricity

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.859 
generator instead of pushing electricity
and<00:01:31.829> stopping<00:01:32.159> pushing<00:01:32.939> stopping<00:01:33.479> pushing

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
and stopping pushing stopping pushing

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
and stopping pushing stopping pushing
stopping<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.220> simply<00:01:35.820> doing<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.750> pushing

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
stopping it is simply doing the pushing

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.399 
stopping it is simply doing the pushing
and<00:01:37.290> stopping<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.549> three<00:01:39.090> different<00:01:39.689> ways

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and stopping but three different ways

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
and stopping but three different ways
and<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.549> three<00:01:41.939> different<00:01:42.720> phases<00:01:43.520> when<00:01:44.520> we

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and in three different phases when we

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.960 
and in three different phases when we
use<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> word<00:01:45.060> phase<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:46.200> mean<00:01:46.439> time<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
use the word phase we mean time and the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.830 
use the word phase we mean time and the
time<00:01:48.299> interval<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:50.040> third<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.390> complete

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
time interval is one third of a complete

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.219 
time interval is one third of a complete

little<00:02:24.790> bit<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.000> electricity<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.840> therefore

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
little bit of electricity and therefore

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.760 
little bit of electricity and therefore
you're<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.850> using<00:02:28.120> one<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.500> three

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
you're just using one of the three

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.760 
you're just using one of the three
phases<00:02:30.100> if<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.810> factory<00:02:32.350> you'll

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
phases if you're in a factory you'll

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.820 
phases if you're in a factory you'll
find<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:34.060> three<00:02:34.750> phases<00:02:35.020> are<00:02:35.260> used<00:02:35.590> on

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
find that all three phases are used on

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.040 
find that all three phases are used on
one<00:02:36.370> machine<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.420> machine<00:02:37.720> might<00:02:38.020> be

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
one machine because the machine might be

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.250 
one machine because the machine might be
quite<00:02:38.440> powerful<00:02:38.770> if<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:40.390> an<00:02:40.570> imbalance

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
quite powerful if you get an imbalance

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.830 
quite powerful if you get an imbalance
of<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.830> use<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.310> each<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.240> three<00:02:43.510> phases

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
of the use of each of the three phases

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.310 
of the use of each of the three phases
you'll<00:02:44.680> find<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.730> machine<00:02:46.420> generating<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
you'll find the machine generating it

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.820 
you'll find the machine generating it
will<00:02:47.860> shake<00:02:48.430> vibrate<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.480> eventually<00:02:50.440> break

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
will shake vibrate and eventually break

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.970 
will shake vibrate and eventually break
down<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.700> make<00:02:52.120> sure<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.780> balance<00:02:53.080> your<00:02:53.620> three

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
down so make sure you balance your three

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.850 
down so make sure you balance your three
phases<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:55.120> at<00:02:55.240> home<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:56.230> worry<00:02:56.560> it

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
phases but at home don't worry it

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.910 
phases but at home don't worry it
doesn't<00:02:56.920> matter
