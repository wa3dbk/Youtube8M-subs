I have some updated information on what

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.330 
I have some updated information on what
their<00:00:12.360> spawning<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.840> before<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> said<00:00:13.590> that

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
their spawning now before I said that

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
their spawning now before I said that
the<00:00:14.580> withers<00:00:14.849> can<00:00:15.059> only<00:00:15.179> spawn<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.660> brick

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the withers can only spawn on brick

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.390 
the withers can only spawn on brick

materials which is partly true it's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
materials which is partly true it's
partly<00:00:20.820> true<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:21.539> withers<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.109> only

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
partly true because withers will only

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
partly true because withers will only

spawn on brick materials inside of
nether<00:00:25.529> fortress<00:00:26.160> chunks<00:00:26.609> where<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.269> are

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
nether fortress chunks where there are

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.109 
nether fortress chunks where there are
not<00:00:27.660> nether<00:00:27.869> fortress<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.160> instance<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
not nether fortress so for instance this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.659 
not nether fortress so for instance this
chunk<00:00:30.510> has<00:00:30.990> another<00:00:31.289> fortress<00:00:31.710> Senate<00:00:32.009> it's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
chunk has another fortress Senate it's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
chunk has another fortress Senate it's
over<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.630> however<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
over there you can see it however the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
over there you can see it however the
nether<00:00:35.460> fortress<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.210> directly<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
nether fortress is not directly on this

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
nether fortress is not directly on this
part<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> chunk<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.719> would<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
part of the chunk so if I would like to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.369 
part of the chunk so if I would like to
have<00:00:41.430> withers<00:00:41.850> spawning<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.140> would

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
have withers spawning here this would

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
have withers spawning here this would
have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> brick<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.370> extend<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> nether

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
have to be brick to extend the nether

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
have to be brick to extend the nether
fortress<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.840> whatever<00:00:46.079> reason<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> want

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
fortress for whatever reason if you want

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
fortress for whatever reason if you want
to<00:00:46.860> extend<00:00:47.070> another<00:00:47.280> fortress<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> has<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.300> be

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
to extend another fortress it has to be

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
to extend another fortress it has to be
in<00:00:48.660> brick<00:00:49.370> however<00:00:50.510> here<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:52.289> clad<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
in brick however here I have clad the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.459 
in brick however here I have clad the
nether<00:00:54.180> fortress<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.930> lapis<00:00:55.829> lazuli<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
nether fortress in lapis lazuli and

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
nether fortress in lapis lazuli and
after<00:00:58.469> some<00:00:58.649> testing<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.280> found<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> withers

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
after some testing I found that withers

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.470 
after some testing I found that withers
will<00:01:00.719> spawn<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.649> naturally<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> let<00:01:03.390> me

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
will spawn here naturally and let me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
will spawn here naturally and let me
just<00:01:03.660> fly<00:01:03.809> around<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> second<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:04.949> if

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
just fly around for a second and see if

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.480 
just fly around for a second and see if
I<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.760> find<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.439> now<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> reason<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
I can find one now the reason this is is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.899 
I can find one now the reason this is is
because<00:01:08.939> withers<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.960> spawn<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.880> areas<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because withers will spawn in areas that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.260 
because withers will spawn in areas that
have<00:01:12.240> nether<00:01:12.479> fortress<00:01:13.670> regardless<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have nether fortress regardless of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.710 
have nether fortress regardless of the
material<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.549> could<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.210> made<00:01:18.689> out

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
material so you could have one made out

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
material so you could have one made out
of<00:01:19.049> dirt<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.520> Kabul<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of dirt or Kabul or if you have a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
of dirt or Kabul or if you have a
ridiculous<00:01:24.030> amount<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.390> lapis<00:01:24.780> lazuli<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
ridiculous amount of lapis lazuli you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609 
ridiculous amount of lapis lazuli you
can<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.310> long<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
can do that as long as you are in a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.060 
can do that as long as you are in a
nether<00:01:29.250> fortress<00:01:29.820> area<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.990> withers<00:01:31.439> will<00:01:31.799> be

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
nether fortress area the withers will be

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
nether fortress area the withers will be
more<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.670> happy<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:33.030> spawn<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.780> in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
more than happy to spawn on it and in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.600 
more than happy to spawn on it and in
fact<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.509> limitedly<00:01:36.590> expand<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:38.040> area

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
fact you can limitedly expand this area

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.569 
fact you can limitedly expand this area
inside<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:41.070> take<00:01:41.280> down

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
inside of it so say I could take down

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.039 
inside of it so say I could take down
this<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:44.149> because<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.509> still<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
this here and because it's still in the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
this here and because it's still in the
general<00:01:46.439> range<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.579> nether<00:01:47.850> fortress<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
general range of the nether fortress I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.710 
general range of the nether fortress I
could<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.770> ahead<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.310> add<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.210> some<00:01:51.570> more

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
could go ahead and add in some more

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.710 
could go ahead and add in some more
spawning<00:01:52.229> space<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.689> however<00:01:54.689> that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
spawning space like this however that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
spawning space like this however that
only<00:01:54.960> works<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.649> bit<00:01:56.030> eventually

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
only works for a little bit eventually

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.340 
only works for a little bit eventually
we'll<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.210> too<00:01:57.450> far<00:01:57.659> away<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> nether

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
we'll get too far away from the nether

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.230 
we'll get too far away from the nether
fortress<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.070> you'll<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.909> start<00:02:00.060> using

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
fortress and you'll have to start using

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.609 
fortress and you'll have to start using
brick<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> game<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.469> no<00:02:01.590> longer

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
brick because the game will no longer

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.420 
brick because the game will no longer
consider<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.000> nether<00:02:03.180> fortress<00:02:04.430> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
consider it the nether fortress so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
consider it the nether fortress so
that's<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.570> little<00:02:07.320> update<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's just a little update on the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
that's just a little update on the
wither<00:02:09.690> spawning<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:11.009> easy<00:02:11.280> to
