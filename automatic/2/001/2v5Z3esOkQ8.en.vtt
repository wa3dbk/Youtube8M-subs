00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi this sleigh miles and details rude and in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 this time I'll tell you about the location 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 plates often crumbling iron plates 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.310
 looks cool from the side but too 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 I want to reach far like a travis barker 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 but for some reason I feel uncomfortable with all these 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.490
 questions one way or another visit each 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 drummer at a certain point in life 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.820
 so it's time for you to decide what is for you 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 the main thing 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 namely the first is convenient for you and you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 calmly play all your plans and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.040
 second oh 2 you are uncomfortable you quickly 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 you get tired but the drums look like 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
 krutyatki to the second example, you can 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.629
 imagine a scene with a concert glinka 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.050
 cool drums look general and straight 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.040
 poly 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.040
 chic 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.930
 only a drummer that damn well 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.480
 decided it seems to me that first 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.790
 all need to proceed from personal comfort 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 well first let's remember the main ones 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.979
 concepts 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.000
 you can not play like this and you can not play 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:24.410
 like this always find some kind of gold 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.660
 middle and now with regards to staging 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 You can play for example with such here 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.390
 staging the higher the plates the more often 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.330
 just like a big google 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.670
 tilt as for me this is first 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.810
 not sexy secondly it seems to me that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.610
 time productions here such here 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.410
 a little bit gone but nevertheless every 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.410
 of course chooses as you wish 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.870
 second option for pure rockers for 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.360
 to knead shook up plate 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.910
 to turn the arms above the shelf and so 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.030
 then there are some people who 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.040
 long hands it is convenient for them to me personally not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 This is especially convenient primarily because 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.960
 the fact that I will just spend more 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.930
 forces to play their game and 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.090
 the main thing for me at a concert is to play 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.860
 ideally your party to the same such 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.020
 way i very often will fall 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.490
 stick in the rib plates and this is also not 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.490
 very good for the fare themselves 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.019
 my version of the game is very different 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.510
 first and second but this principle 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.090
 noticeably if you pay attention to your 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.069
 plate put a little bit with a different angle 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.319
 that is, it turns out they are directed 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.599
 a little bit of me why is this happening 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.470
 because I always sit a little over 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.140
 setting and therefore the height of the plates to me 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.290
 comfortable but the angle is not quite right 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.549
 It turns out for a good blow 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.819
 perhaps from the side it will look 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.189
 not a super ofiget but none the less 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.349
 important for me is good all play and 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.629
 to be convenient first of all to me 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.790
 believe the viewers look at me for beauty 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.769
 your settings she is the beauty of your game 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.840
 so remember that first of all 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.840
 need to proceed from the convenience 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.079
 Well, I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.120

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.180

 Good thanks for watching and remember 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.879
 the main thing to understand 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.349
 they chisel with you was sleigh miles and 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.349
 detail game for now
