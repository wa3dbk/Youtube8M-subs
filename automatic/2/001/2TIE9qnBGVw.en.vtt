presentations<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> want<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> illustrate

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
presentations so I want to illustrate

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.180 
presentations so I want to illustrate
this<00:00:41.989> looking<00:00:42.989> at<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.260> particular<00:00:43.739> system

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
this looking at this particular system

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.930 
this looking at this particular system
here<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> pump<00:00:46.610> check<00:00:47.610> valve

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
here here we have a pump check valve

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.990 
here here we have a pump check valve
pumping<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.559> elevated<00:00:50.190> storage<00:00:50.610> tank

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
pumping up to an elevated storage tank

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600 
pumping up to an elevated storage tank
we're<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.199> happens<00:00:52.649> when

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
we're going to look at what happens when

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
we're going to look at what happens when
the<00:00:53.820> pump<00:00:54.390> trips<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> rapid

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the pump trips or you have a rapid

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.299 
the pump trips or you have a rapid
shutdown<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> pump<00:00:57.239> station<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
shutdown of the pump station so we can

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.740 
shutdown of the pump station so we can
basically

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
basically

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.380 
basically
play<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.740> and<00:01:03.839> it<00:01:04.839> will<00:01:05.110> show<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.640> results

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
play this and it will show the results

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.210 
play this and it will show the results
of<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.630> analysis<00:01:08.260> as<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.560> can<00:01:08.710> see<00:01:08.890> initially

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
of the analysis as you can see initially

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.120 
of the analysis as you can see initially
the<00:01:09.610> flow<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.060> going<00:01:10.420> from<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.290> pump<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
the flow is going from the pump to the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.350 
the flow is going from the pump to the
tank<00:01:12.850> now<00:01:13.540> as<00:01:13.720> we<00:01:13.900> play<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.880> you'll<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:16.150> that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
tank now as we play it you'll see that

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.980 
tank now as we play it you'll see that
the<00:01:16.600> pump<00:01:16.960> slows<00:01:17.410> down<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:19.119> valve<00:01:19.540> trips

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the pump slows down and the valve trips

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.900 
the pump slows down and the valve trips
very<00:01:20.200> quickly<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.860> as<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.130> wave<00:01:21.369> goes<00:01:21.700> down

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
very quickly and as the wave goes down

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.990 
very quickly and as the wave goes down
the<00:01:22.150> line<00:01:22.390> you<00:01:23.170> get<00:01:23.410> negative<00:01:24.280> pressures

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
the line you get negative pressures

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.310 
the line you get negative pressures
cavitation<00:01:25.810> that's<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.170> we're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
cavitation that's what we're

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.590 
cavitation that's what we're
representing<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:27.160> as<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.090> cavities

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
representing and as the cavities

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.170 
representing and as the cavities
collapse<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.350> get<00:01:29.500> pressure<00:01:29.860> spikes<00:01:30.340> so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
collapse you get pressure spikes so

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.490 
collapse you get pressure spikes so
we're<00:01:31.360> having<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.720> very<00:01:32.020> very<00:01:32.740> serious

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
we're having a very very serious

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.780 
we're having a very very serious
transient<00:01:35.500> in<00:01:35.649> this<00:01:35.830> situation<00:01:36.220> we're

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
transient in this situation we're

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.170 
transient in this situation we're
running<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.060> 10-second<00:01:37.720> simulation<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
running a 10-second simulation and it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.630 
running a 10-second simulation and it
stops<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.990> what<00:01:41.440> you're<00:01:41.680> seeing<00:01:41.920> here<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.369> an

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
stops and what you're seeing here is an

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.219 
stops and what you're seeing here is an
envelope<00:01:43.149> of<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.509> minimum<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.170> maximum

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
envelope of the minimum and maximum

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.969 
envelope of the minimum and maximum
pressures<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:46.180> minimum<00:01:46.570> pressure<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:47.200> at<00:01:47.680> all

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
pressures the minimum pressure is at all

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.359 
pressures the minimum pressure is at all
places<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.119> line<00:01:49.330> about<00:01:50.259> minus<00:01:50.740> 30<00:01:51.039> feet

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
places in the line about minus 30 feet

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.029 
places in the line about minus 30 feet
which<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.640> cavitation<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.930> we<00:01:53.380> have<00:01:53.500> maximum

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
which is cavitation and we have maximum

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.020 
which is cavitation and we have maximum
pressures<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.729> are<00:01:54.789> very<00:01:55.360> high<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.170> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pressures that are very high so this is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.330 
pressures that are very high so this is
been<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> serious<00:01:58.600> transient<00:01:59.440> this<00:02:00.039> is<00:02:00.220> an

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
been a serious transient this is an

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.900 
been a serious transient this is an
unprotected<00:02:00.880> system<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.670> certainly

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
unprotected system and we certainly

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.110 
unprotected system and we certainly
would<00:02:04.330> not<00:02:04.360> want<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.500> design<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.920> pipe

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
would not want to design a pipe

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.590 
would not want to design a pipe
a<00:02:07.619> pipeline<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.979> pump<00:02:09.190> station<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.910> that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
a pipeline and a pump station that that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.160 
a pipeline and a pump station that that
did<00:02:10.930> this<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:13.180> we're<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> repeat<00:02:13.960> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
did this now we're going to repeat the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.790 
did this now we're going to repeat the
simulation<00:02:15.040> for<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.090> system<00:02:17.080> with<00:02:17.290> some<00:02:17.560> air

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
simulation for a system with some air

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.480 
simulation for a system with some air
valves<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.210> three<00:02:19.570> air<00:02:19.750> valves

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
valves so we have three air valves

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.830 
valves so we have three air valves
position<00:02:21.490> here<00:02:21.760> at<00:02:21.790> high<00:02:22.150> points<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.720> the

analysis<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.690> look<00:02:25.900> at<00:02:26.050> what<00:02:26.530> happens<00:02:26.980> with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
analysis and look at what happens with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.050 
analysis and look at what happens with
the<00:02:27.670> air<00:02:27.970> valves<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:29.830> again<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.340> pump<00:02:30.610> slows

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the air valves now again the pump slows

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.040 
the air valves now again the pump slows
down<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.860> check<00:02:33.130> valve<00:02:33.400> closes<00:02:34.210> as<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.930> go

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
down the check valve closes as you go

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.750 
down the check valve closes as you go
down<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.290> line<00:02:35.650> you'll<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.370> there's<00:02:36.610> no

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
down the line you'll see that there's no

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.420 
down the line you'll see that there's no

cavitation beyond the air valves your

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640 
cavitation beyond the air valves your

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
valves are pulling in error but here's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.900 
valves are pulling in error but here's
something<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> take<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.550> close

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
something I want you to take a close

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.480 
something I want you to take a close
look<00:02:43.060> at<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:44.320> air<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.680> expelled<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.340> get

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
look at as the air is expelled you get

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.820 
look at as the air is expelled you get
this<00:02:45.670> big<00:02:45.910> pressure<00:02:46.210> spike<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.900> when<00:02:47.650> that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
this big pressure spike and when that

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.300 
this big pressure spike and when that
happens<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.520> start<00:02:48.790> getting<00:02:48.940> spiking<00:02:49.570> around

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
happens you start getting spiking around

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.900 
happens you start getting spiking around
cavitation<00:02:51.310> forming<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.650> final<00:02:54.490> result

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
cavitation forming and the final result

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.460 
cavitation forming and the final result
is<00:02:55.380> basically<00:02:57.420> almost<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.870> bad<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.260> with<00:02:59.440> no

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
is basically almost as bad as with no

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.040 
is basically almost as bad as with no
surge<00:02:59.980> protection<00:03:00.520> now<00:03:01.330> these<00:03:01.450> air<00:03:01.690> valves

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
surge protection now these air valves

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.690 
surge protection now these air valves
were<00:03:02.170> nominal<00:03:02.740> air<00:03:02.890> valves<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.400> think<00:03:03.550> there

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
were nominal air valves I think there

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.260 
were nominal air valves I think there
are<00:03:03.730> four<00:03:04.060> inch<00:03:04.240> in<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.660> four<00:03:04.900> inch<00:03:05.080> out<00:03:05.380> and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
are four inch in and four inch out and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.930 
are four inch in and four inch out and
they<00:03:07.270> are<00:03:07.780> known<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.800> often<00:03:09.250> release<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.820> air

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
they are known to often release the air

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.060 
they are known to often release the air
too<00:03:10.180> quickly<00:03:10.480> causing<00:03:10.930> air<00:03:11.290> slams<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.890> that's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
too quickly causing air slams and that's

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.540 
too quickly causing air slams and that's
what<00:03:12.250> we<00:03:12.400> saw<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.170> there<00:03:14.170> are<00:03:14.350> anti<00:03:14.860> slam<00:03:15.280> air

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
what we saw here there are anti slam air

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.090 
what we saw here there are anti slam air
valves<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> certainly<00:03:16.540> would<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.830> better

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
valves that certainly would do a better

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.580 
valves that certainly would do a better
job

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
job

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.759 
job
and<00:03:19.940> eliminating<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> air<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:22.140> air<00:03:22.349> slams

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
and eliminating the air the air slams

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.339 
and eliminating the air the air slams
that<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.459> saw<00:03:26.120> now<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.180> final<00:03:27.569> analysis

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
that we just saw now the final analysis

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.320 
that we just saw now the final analysis
I<00:03:28.470> want<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.769> show<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> surge<00:03:29.910> tank

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
I want to show you is with a surge tank

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.259 
I want to show you is with a surge tank
and<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:31.410> surge<00:03:31.680> tank<00:03:32.099> will<00:03:32.819> when<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
and the surge tank will when the

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.420 
and the surge tank will when the
pressure<00:03:33.510> drops<00:03:33.959> start<00:03:34.410> providing<00:03:34.800> water<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
pressure drops start providing water to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.059 
pressure drops start providing water to
the<00:03:35.730> system<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.840> let's<00:03:37.080> take<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.379> look<00:03:37.650> at<00:03:37.769> how

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the system so let's take a look at how

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.650 
the system so let's take a look at how
this<00:03:38.629> is<00:03:39.650> animated<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.730> pump<00:03:41.970> slows<00:03:42.390> down

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
this is animated the pump slows down

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.070 
this is animated the pump slows down
again<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.230> check<00:03:43.470> valve<00:03:43.739> closes<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.430> now

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
again the check valve closes but now

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.070 
again the check valve closes but now
water<00:03:46.080> continues<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:47.280> flow<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
water continues to flow to this to the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.490 
water continues to flow to this to the
tank<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.360> pressure<00:03:51.360> doesn't<00:03:51.780> drop<00:03:52.230> down

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
tank and the pressure doesn't drop down

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.300 
tank and the pressure doesn't drop down
below<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.190> line<00:03:54.319> the<00:03:55.319> maximum<00:03:56.069> pressure

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
below this line the maximum pressure

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.680 
below this line the maximum pressure
barely<00:03:57.090> goes<00:03:57.299> above<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.370> steady-state

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
barely goes above the steady-state

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.170 
barely goes above the steady-state
pressure<00:04:00.690> line<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:02.310> surge<00:04:02.640> tank<00:04:02.970> has<00:04:03.150> been

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
pressure line the surge tank has been

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.569 
pressure line the surge tank has been
very<00:04:03.720> effective<00:04:03.930> at<00:04:04.650> providing<00:04:05.129> surge

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
very effective at providing surge

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.850 
very effective at providing surge
protection<00:04:06.170> well<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.290> whole<00:04:07.440> point<00:04:07.500> here

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
protection well the whole point here

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.360 
protection well the whole point here
here<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.879> we<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.410> this<00:04:10.410> graphical

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
here is that we have this graphical

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.569 
here is that we have this graphical
presentation<00:04:11.610> tool<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:13.290> certainly<00:04:14.099> allows

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
presentation tool that certainly allows

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.849 
presentation tool that certainly allows
these<00:04:14.959> presentations<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.410> made<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
these presentations to be made to

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.270 
these presentations to be made to
clients<00:04:17.459> or<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:19.350> other<00:04:19.889> firms<00:04:20.780> which<00:04:21.780> will

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
clients or to other firms which will

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.510 
clients or to other firms which will
illustrate<00:04:23.479> very<00:04:24.479> clearly<00:04:25.310> what<00:04:26.310> is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
illustrate very clearly what is

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.400 
illustrate very clearly what is
happening<00:04:27.060> in<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> system<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
happening in the system so this is a

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.260 
happening in the system so this is a
feature<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.490> we're<00:04:29.820> very<00:04:30.120> excited<00:04:30.360> about

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
feature that we're very excited about

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.330 
feature that we're very excited about
you
