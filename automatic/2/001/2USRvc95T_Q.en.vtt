00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
satellite view from up top you can zero

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.940 
satellite view from up top you can zero
in<00:02:06.380> make<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:07.799> closer<00:02:09.170> zoom<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.770> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
in make it a lot closer zoom out but it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
in make it a lot closer zoom out but it
doesn't<00:02:11.340> give<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> same<00:02:12.030> information<00:02:12.300> as

doesn't give you the same information as
this<00:02:13.260> one

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.420 
this one
so<00:02:13.739> I've<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.849> best<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.209> both<00:02:15.420> worlds<00:02:15.900> here
