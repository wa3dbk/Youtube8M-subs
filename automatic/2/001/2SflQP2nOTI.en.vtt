00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
when I first sewn out with the software

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.089 
when I first sewn out with the software
I<00:01:50.200> thought<00:01:50.500> hey<00:01:50.740> who<00:01:50.950> said<00:01:51.159> nerd<00:01:51.670> over<00:01:52.299> there

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.099 
I thought hey who said nerd over there

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:56.099 
I thought hey who said nerd over there
we<00:01:54.099> know<00:01:54.280> what<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.729> was<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.030> do<00:01:55.750> all<00:01:55.780> this

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
we know what it was to do all this

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.050 
we know what it was to do all this
handwork<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.069> all<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.670> know<00:01:57.819> this<00:01:58.000> is

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
handwork and all this you know this is

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.349 
handwork and all this you know this is
tedious<00:01:59.310> building<00:02:00.310> was<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.609> really<00:02:00.880> sort<00:02:01.270> of

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
tedious building was this really sort of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.679 
tedious building was this really sort of
difficult<00:02:02.140> process<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.829> now<00:02:03.700> with<00:02:03.969> PTC<00:02:04.390> creo

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
difficult process and now with PTC creo

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.219 
difficult process and now with PTC creo
or<00:02:05.110> ana<00:02:05.229> for<00:02:05.500> short<00:02:05.829> it<00:02:06.039> was<00:02:06.219> like<00:02:07.049> my<00:02:08.049> eyes

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
or ana for short it was like my eyes

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.979 
or ana for short it was like my eyes
popped<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:11.970> big<00:02:12.970> difference<00:02:13.390> between<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.720> good

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
popped out big difference between a good

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.350 
popped out big difference between a good
guitar<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.590> guitars<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:16.060> comes

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
guitar and this guitars that it it comes

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.690 
guitar and this guitars that it it comes
out<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.810> molten<00:02:17.290> aluminium<00:02:17.440> mold<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.220> this

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
out of a molten aluminium mold and this

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.330 
out of a molten aluminium mold and this
mold<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:20.049> cannot<00:02:20.379> change<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.040> has<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.220> be

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
mold you cannot change it it has to be

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.589 
mold you cannot change it it has to be
perfect<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.450> engineer

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
perfect so you have to engineer

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.680 
perfect so you have to engineer
everything<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.829> computer<00:02:24.209> till<00:02:25.209> till<00:02:25.569> the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
everything in the computer till till the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.140 
everything in the computer till till the
last<00:02:26.160> thousands<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.340> millimeter<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.940> can

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
last thousands of a millimeter you can

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.759 
last thousands of a millimeter you can
stitch<00:02:28.359> these<00:02:28.569> surfaces<00:02:29.079> continuously

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
stitch these surfaces continuously

model<00:02:35.049> as<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.819> starting<00:02:36.819> point<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.920> 100%<00:02:38.920> copied

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
model as a starting point is 100% copied

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.520 
model as a starting point is 100% copied
into<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.030> mold<00:02:40.269> there<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:40.989> no<00:02:41.109> difference

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
into the mold there is no difference

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.259 
into the mold there is no difference
between<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.010> computer<00:02:42.400> model<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
between the computer model and the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.010 
between the computer model and the
actual<00:02:43.420> guitar

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
actual guitar

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.920 
actual guitar
so<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.860> guitar<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.580> really<00:02:46.940> dynamic<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.690> you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so this guitar is really dynamic and you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.420 
so this guitar is really dynamic and you
know<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.110> could<00:02:48.350> express<00:02:48.680> yourself<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.340> many

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
know you could express yourself in many

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:06.160 
know you could express yourself in many
ways<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:59.800> can<00:03:00.800> also<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.190> no<00:03:01.730> heart<00:03:02.060> or<00:03:02.270> if<00:03:05.170> she

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
ways I can also just no heart or if she

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.070 
ways I can also just no heart or if she
was<00:03:06.320> real<00:03:06.740> future<00:03:07.340> also<00:03:07.550> for<00:03:08.330> axman's<00:03:08.810> he's

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
was real future also for axman's he's

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.070 
was real future also for axman's he's
like<00:03:10.210> magician<00:03:11.210> on<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.450> strings

like magician on the strings
I<00:03:12.430> can<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.580> go<00:03:13.760> freaky<00:03:14.360> with<00:03:14.510> it

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.610 

and<00:03:38.489> then<00:03:39.420> go<00:03:39.689> back<00:03:39.719> to<00:03:41.299> whatever<00:03:42.620> starting

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and then go back to whatever starting

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.190 
and then go back to whatever starting
with<00:03:43.769> an<00:03:43.889> idea<00:03:44.219> about<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.609> guitar<00:03:44.939> going<00:03:45.810> into

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
with an idea about the guitar going into

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.039 
with an idea about the guitar going into
a<00:03:46.230> design<00:03:47.099> going<00:03:47.819> into<00:03:47.999> a<00:03:48.030> computer<00:03:48.689> drawing

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
a design going into a computer drawing

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.610 
a design going into a computer drawing
and<00:03:49.469> actually<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.219> a<00:03:50.249> lot<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.459> craftsmanship

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
and actually with a lot of craftsmanship

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.050 
and actually with a lot of craftsmanship
going<00:03:52.620> into<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.950> hands<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.430> artist<00:03:53.849> it's

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
going into the hands of the artist it's

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.200 
going into the hands of the artist it's
pretty<00:03:54.480> amazing<00:03:54.719> to<00:03:54.959> see

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.000 

I<00:04:01.300> played<00:04:02.080> all<00:04:02.110> over<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.530> world<00:04:02.710> with<00:04:02.890> this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
I played all over the world with this

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.310 
I played all over the world with this
guitar<00:04:03.160> defense<00:04:03.970> was<00:04:04.240> always<00:04:04.480> really<00:04:05.200> good

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
guitar defense was always really good

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.860 
guitar defense was always really good
it's<00:04:05.920> done<00:04:06.400> like<00:04:06.670> design<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.360> really<00:04:07.510> really

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
it's done like design is really really

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.710 
it's done like design is really really
cool<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.790> for<00:04:09.790> me<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> best<00:04:10.210> thing<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.570> if

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
cool and for me the best thing is if

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.780 
cool and for me the best thing is if
they<00:04:10.870> say<00:04:11.110> like<00:04:11.320> sounds<00:04:11.830> amazing<00:04:12.070> what<00:04:12.460> is<00:04:12.610> it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
they say like sounds amazing what is it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.540 
they say like sounds amazing what is it
I<00:04:12.970> think<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.510> has<00:04:14.050> improved<00:04:14.380> my<00:04:14.590> playing<00:04:14.860> in

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
I think it has improved my playing in

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.590 
I think it has improved my playing in
the<00:04:15.730> way<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:16.450> fully<00:04:16.870> express<00:04:17.830> myself

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
the way that I can fully express myself

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.030 
the way that I can fully express myself
especially<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> live<00:04:19.900> situation<00:04:20.050> it's<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
especially in a live situation it's the

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.070 
especially in a live situation it's the
main<00:04:21.400> motivation<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.450> whole<00:04:22.570> journey<00:04:22.840> I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
main motivation of the whole journey I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.010 
main motivation of the whole journey I
mean<00:04:23.260> when<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.530> have<00:04:23.890> somebody<00:04:24.660> pick<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:25.840> your

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
mean when you have somebody pick up your

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.910 
mean when you have somebody pick up your
products<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.780> create<00:04:28.780> this<00:04:28.930> music<00:04:29.380> with<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.710> I

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
products and create this music with it I

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.580 
products and create this music with it I
mean<00:04:30.780> what<00:04:31.780> better<00:04:31.810> things<00:04:32.200> can<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.410> do<00:04:32.560> on

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
mean what better things can you do on

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:42.480 
mean what better things can you do on
this<00:04:32.740> planet

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.749 

I<00:04:43.139> think<00:04:44.139> classics<00:04:44.949> are<00:04:45.100> played<00:04:45.310> by<00:04:45.430> heroes

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
I think classics are played by heroes

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.850 
I think classics are played by heroes
but<00:04:46.060> maybe<00:04:46.270> it's<00:04:46.509> time<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.690> make<00:04:47.020> new<00:04:47.530> heroes

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
but maybe it's time to make new heroes

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.490 
but maybe it's time to make new heroes
with<00:04:48.100> new<00:04:48.250> different<00:04:48.520> guitars<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.380> then<00:04:50.380> it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
with new different guitars and then it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.240 
with new different guitars and then it
maybe<00:04:50.770> becomes<00:04:51.250> classical<00:04:51.789> something
