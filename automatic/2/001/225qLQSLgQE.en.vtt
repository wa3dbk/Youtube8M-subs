00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
attacker as our policy says and so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.690 
attacker as our policy says and so

they'll come after me and hopefully

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.130 
they'll come after me and hopefully
they're<00:01:40.090> not<00:01:40.210> doing<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.600> Tory<00:01:40.840> but

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
probably we can have four so I got a two

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
probably we can have four so I got a two
tires<00:02:03.520> /<00:02:04.360> different<00:02:04.960> tires<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:06.220> vehicle

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
tires / different tires on one vehicle

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.090 
tires / different tires on one vehicle
and<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.870> determined<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:08.950> were

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
and it was determined that there were

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.660 
and it was determined that there were
slashed<00:02:09.790> tires<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:11.320> something<00:02:12.250> interesting

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
slashed tires so something interesting

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.280 
slashed tires so something interesting
that<00:02:12.700> happened<00:02:12.850> earlier<00:02:13.600> today<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:14.080> maybe

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that happened earlier today or maybe

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.760 
that happened earlier today or maybe
around<00:02:14.620> eleven<00:02:14.770> o'clock<00:02:15.130> or<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:16.770> vehicle

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
around eleven o'clock or so a vehicle

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.820 
around eleven o'clock or so a vehicle
drove<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.220> real<00:02:18.790> close<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.480> our<00:02:19.960> vehicles<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
drove up real close to our vehicles and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.600 
drove up real close to our vehicles and
a<00:02:21.270> stop<00:02:22.270> two<00:02:22.570> guys<00:02:22.810> jumped<00:02:23.320> out<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:24.280> happen

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
a stop two guys jumped out and we happen

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.250 
a stop two guys jumped out and we happen
to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.790> around<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.390> they<00:02:25.630> saw<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.230> were

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
to be around and they saw that we were

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.680 
to be around and they saw that we were
looking<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:26.860> them<00:02:27.070> out<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> window<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
looking at them out the window so the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.960 
looking at them out the window so the
cowards<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.380> guess<00:02:29.560> decided<00:02:30.190> they<00:02:30.580> want<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.850> run

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
cowards I guess decided they want to run

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.430 
cowards I guess decided they want to run
down<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> street<00:02:31.300> which<00:02:31.810> was<00:02:31.840> really<00:02:32.260> awkward

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
down the street which was really awkward

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.490 
down the street which was really awkward
and<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.489> man<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> car<00:02:34.180> drove<00:02:34.959> down<00:02:35.260> and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and the man in the car drove down and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.229 
and the man in the car drove down and
picked<00:02:35.739> them<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.220> they<00:02:36.340> kind<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.180> just

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
picked them up and they kind of just

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.730 
picked them up and they kind of just
drove<00:02:37.780> away<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.320> I

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
drove away like I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.670 
drove away like I

they're<00:02:42.830> intending<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.400> do<00:02:43.550> but<00:02:43.730> it's<00:02:44.000> very

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
they're intending to do but it's very

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.840 
they're intending to do but it's very
very<00:02:44.510> strange<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.070> far<00:02:46.310> we<00:02:46.490> don't<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:46.700> any

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
very strange so far we don't have any

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.400 
very strange so far we don't have any
more<00:02:46.970> tires<00:02:47.240> popped<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.810> at<00:02:47.960> least<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.380> now

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
more tires popped in at least for now

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.590 
more tires popped in at least for now
and<00:02:48.740> we're<00:02:49.520> most<00:02:49.730> likely<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.330> be<00:02:50.480> at

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
and we're most likely going to be at

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.960 
and we're most likely going to be at
most<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.020> night<00:02:51.200> just<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:52.250> some<00:02:52.580> fun<00:02:52.790> and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
maybe we'll catch some idiot that's

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.720 
maybe we'll catch some idiot that's
going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.780> do<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.110> luckily<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> bit
