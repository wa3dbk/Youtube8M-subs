00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.299
 Once upon a time, a room was accumulated 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.940
 talented managers in the avenue of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.490
 autonomous as a slightly gray for one 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 just those entered and they on letter 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 to look for someone and join one another 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.880
 a little way too long 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.090
 I have very sent to world 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.109
 clear clear after jousting 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.220

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.490

 Do you see it very much? 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.700

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.680
 The client has generous 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.230
 Spend a new girlfriend 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.640

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:18.010
 Kept to bargain user offer 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 Christian and I still 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.540
 on open spaces I out too long 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 I had to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 the search itself turned out to be 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
 refreshing the prohibition of one 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.350
 Finance in the chance of your arts 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.580
 presents worthy 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 therefore yes and I still have to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.500
 Sun then wants to go but one 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.630

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.480
 the others shuddered 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.290
 was baptized on the sonorous name 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.020
 were 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.060
 With this one hoped for a pot 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.440
 or at least a record of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 to have found world 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.720
 At once they mobilized all their forces 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 and with lightning and thunder the clouds were up 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.110
 to banish a picture 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.680

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 opposite 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.610
 the moving picture should be recorded 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.769
 become the physical conditions 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.769

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.629

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.180
 out 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 as an accompaniment to his angelic peers 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.220
 The best ones were ordered 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:10.230
 instrumentalists and left that 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:14.599
 vegetables without money 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.599
 not before I go disappear 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.530
 his pictorial impressions became the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.320
 great masters worthy of a unit 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.750
 arranged in image and sound merge 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.200
 This was the first time in history 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.200
 Jewry 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.220
