00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.480
 there and how to use it to destroy 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.359
 A lot of people are playing games with me. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.279
 is having this doubt of how it is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.590
 use it to destroy the doors to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.110
 The first thing I'm gonna do is fall. 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 when I answered that it comes from that area 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 from up here you will fall into this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.870
 area here because you will need 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 do is climb this ladder okay mpula ac 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 dc sendak the giant will have that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 cell here in this door here goes 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.949
 being a green key you will use the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 key to open that door and every round 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.799
 will make an endorsement of this sinister 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.450
 here the liter of alcohol and with a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.130
 liter of alcohol you can give it to him 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.229
 slope and will always destroy your 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.700
 back 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.470
 one thing i want to do is 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.580
 next is never in the front 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.740
 because otherwise he will 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 going over and you will debate and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.720
 You'll fall, okay, it 'll end up having. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 a fall for nothing 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 something else I would like to spend 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.070
 for you also the following during the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 round when you have been killing a zombie 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.320
 You do not shoot him because if you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.960
 Shoot him, what will happen is him 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.470
 Going back to the cell again. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 OK 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.890
 Okay, so it's just to remind everyone. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.840
 round will be backed by alcohol and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 usually it will stay within these 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.640
 students over here on that door here 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.040
 of these threats and he's on the counter 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 or something like that here 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.560
 usually in this hall here or else there 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.530
 the same cell where it backs up the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.080
 First time and now I'll show you 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.620
 how are you guys going to use them if you 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.120
 give it a punch on them so it will run 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.260
 a little faster you can use this 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.850
 in your favor 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.770
 Are you going to bring it by the local are 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.320

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.990
 are you going to do local lipo that you want 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.110
 he will be let it always off shore 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.330
 to the site and use alcohol and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.060
 This will destroy the place and I will 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.810
 show you he destroyed the place 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.209

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.000
 barrier in front of you 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.340
