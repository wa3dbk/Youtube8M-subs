feel it has rabies
yeah<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.600> rabies<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> animal

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
yeah the thing with rabies is the animal

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.570 
yeah the thing with rabies is the animal
when<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
when it's in

when it's in
warranty<00:02:08.880> period<00:02:09.300> usually<00:02:09.510> won't<00:02:09.810> survive

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
warranty period usually won't survive

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.410 
warranty period usually won't survive
more<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.650> week<00:02:10.800> or<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:12.060> roundworm

woodchuck will live a full nine ten year

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.030 
woodchuck will live a full nine ten year
old<00:02:14.670> life<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.540> basically<00:02:16.020> an<00:02:16.380> animal<00:02:16.650> like

old life so basically an animal like
Wendell<00:02:17.460> or<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> mammal<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.510> woodchuck<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.140> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
Wendell or a mammal a woodchuck like I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.630 
Wendell or a mammal a woodchuck like I
know<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.740> don't<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.070> me<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> call<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.490> witch

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
a groundhog like Wendell cannot go back

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.620 
a groundhog like Wendell cannot go back
out<00:02:23.520> into<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.730> wild<00:02:23.940> because<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.540> this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
out into the wild because of this

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.540 
out into the wild because of this
condition<00:02:24.840> he<00:02:25.140> has<00:02:25.350> worms<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> brain

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
condition he has worms on the brain

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.900 
condition he has worms on the brain
basically<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.680> if<00:02:28.680> he<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.190> back<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
basically and if he is back out in the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910 
basically and if he is back out in the
wild<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.410> very<00:02:31.620> easy<00:02:31.800> for

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
wild then you know be very easy for

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.160 
wild then you know be very easy for
predator<00:02:32.490> pick<00:02:32.700> him<00:02:32.850> off<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:33.660> right<00:02:33.930> it
