00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
where they are when they are and when to

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.339 
where they are when they are and when to

move them to the next aircraft there are

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.750 
move them to the next aircraft there are
two<00:02:48.500> different<00:02:48.829> things<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.640> happen

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
two different things that have to happen

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.940 
two different things that have to happen
during<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.239> icing<00:02:50.629> so<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:51.200> could<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.680> clean

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
during the icing so you could just clean

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.789 
during the icing so you could just clean
the<00:02:52.190> airplane<00:02:53.150> off<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> type<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.440> fluid

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
the airplane off with a type one fluid

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.940 
the airplane off with a type one fluid
type<00:02:55.280> one<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.670> de-icing<00:02:56.120> fluid<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.810> heated

type one is a de-icing fluid is heated

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.490 
type one is a de-icing fluid is heated
comes<00:02:57.950> out<00:02:58.129> how<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.370> takes<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.849> snow<00:02:59.120> off<00:02:59.500> if

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
comes out how it takes the snow off if

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.259 
comes out how it takes the snow off if
it<00:03:00.680> was<00:03:00.769> snowing<00:03:00.980> out<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.489> would<00:03:01.790> have<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.090> put

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
it was snowing out I would have to put

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.349 
it was snowing out I would have to put
anti<00:03:02.660> icing<00:03:02.840> fluid<00:03:03.410> which<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.590> type<00:03:03.920> four

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
anti icing fluid which is type four

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.880 
anti icing fluid which is type four
which<00:03:05.359> will<00:03:05.629> then<00:03:05.870> hold<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.319> precipitation

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
which will then hold that precipitation

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.559 
which will then hold that precipitation
on<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.280> wing<00:03:07.489> until<00:03:07.970> you're<00:03:08.090> ready<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.390> take

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
on the wing until you're ready to take

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.630 
on the wing until you're ready to take
on<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.049> what<00:03:09.260> happens<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.310> keeps<00:03:10.519> the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
on and what happens is it just keeps the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.610 
on and what happens is it just keeps the
contamination<00:03:11.390> from<00:03:11.659> adhering<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.440> wing

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
contamination from adhering to the wing

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.890 
contamination from adhering to the wing
and<00:03:12.859> then<00:03:13.400> once<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.849> take<00:03:13.879> off<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.540> slides

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and then once you take off it slides

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.160 
and then once you take off it slides
right<00:03:15.109> off<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.549> wing<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.849> clear<00:03:17.180> this

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
right off and the wing is clear this

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.500 
right off and the wing is clear this

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
fluid the older trucks everything was

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.589 
fluid the older trucks everything was
pre-mixed<00:03:23.780> at<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.930> 55/45<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:26.150> whatever<00:03:26.450> you

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
pre-mixed at a 55/45 so whatever you

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.080 
pre-mixed at a 55/45 so whatever you
spray<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.500> manner<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:28.010> how<00:03:28.160> warm<00:03:28.489> or<00:03:28.669> cold<00:03:28.849> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
spray the manner of how warm or cold it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.990 
spray the manner of how warm or cold it
is<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:30.109> was<00:03:30.290> give<00:03:30.859> you<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.010> more<00:03:31.220> concentrated

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
is it was give you a more concentrated

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.839 
is it was give you a more concentrated
mix<00:03:32.209> because<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.569> was<00:03:32.690> set<00:03:32.930> for<00:03:33.169> like<00:03:33.319> 40<00:03:34.010> -<00:03:34.489> 40

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
mix because it was set for like 40 - 40

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.900 
mix because it was set for like 40 - 40
degrees<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:36.169> minus<00:03:36.380> 60<00:03:36.919> degrees<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.579> used

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
degrees to minus 60 degrees so you used

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.569 
degrees to minus 60 degrees so you used
a<00:03:38.030> lot<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.209> glycol<00:03:38.870> with<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.109> old<00:03:39.230> trucks

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
a lot more glycol with the old trucks

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.319 
a lot more glycol with the old trucks
now<00:03:40.579> what<00:03:41.510> we're<00:03:41.750> doing<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:43.010> spraying<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.090> lot

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
now what we're doing is spraying a lot

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.909 
now what we're doing is spraying a lot
less<00:03:44.629> fluid<00:03:45.139> a<00:03:45.319> lot<00:03:46.040> more<00:03:46.340> water<00:03:46.579> mix<00:03:47.120> ratio

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
less fluid a lot more water mix ratio

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.699 
less fluid a lot more water mix ratio
cost<00:03:48.919> savings<00:03:49.459> in<00:03:49.639> fluid<00:03:50.120> for<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.139> for<00:03:51.620> the

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
cost savings in fluid for the for the

way the fluid is today has come a very
long<00:04:20.000> way<00:04:20.919> when<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.039> comes<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.400> de-icing<00:04:22.699> in<00:04:23.000> a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
long way when it comes to de-icing in a

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.450 
long way when it comes to de-icing in a
snow<00:04:23.330> event<00:04:23.479> we<00:04:24.260> will<00:04:24.440> dispatch<00:04:24.650> anywhere

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
snow event we will dispatch anywhere

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.450 
snow event we will dispatch anywhere
from<00:04:25.760> 14<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.720> 18<00:04:26.930> trucks

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
from 14 to 18 trucks

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.600 
from 14 to 18 trucks
that<00:04:28.940> handle<00:04:29.930> at<00:04:30.050> least<00:04:30.080> 12<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.830> 14<00:04:31.160> departures

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
that handle at least 12 to 14 departures

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.719 
that handle at least 12 to 14 departures
per<00:04:31.910> hour<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.930> it's<00:04:33.259> not<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.500> one<00:04:34.130> truck<00:04:34.430> for

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
per hour so it's not just one truck for

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.640 
per hour so it's not just one truck for
one<00:04:34.850> airplane<00:04:35.240> we<00:04:35.840> usually<00:04:36.169> attack<00:04:36.440> each

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
one airplane we usually attack each

one airplane we usually attack each

sometimes<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.130> ice<00:04:40.250> time<00:04:40.520> could<00:04:40.759> be

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
sometimes and that the ice time could be

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.670 
sometimes and that the ice time could be
anywhere<00:04:41.300> from<00:04:41.360> five<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.870> seven<00:04:42.050> minutes<00:04:42.289> from

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
the time that the departure is ready to

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.120 
the time that the departure is ready to
go<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.949> that's<00:04:46.819> a<00:04:47.449> pretty<00:04:47.900> small<00:04:48.770> amount<00:04:48.830> of

go and that's a pretty small amount of

we're trying to shoot for is the safe
