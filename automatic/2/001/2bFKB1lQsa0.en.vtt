later<00:02:45.319> in<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.560> episode<00:02:45.709> as<00:02:46.160> we<00:02:46.400> saw<00:02:46.660> as<00:02:47.660> he

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
later in this episode as we saw as he

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
later in this episode as we saw as he
poor<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.230> there<00:02:48.380> was<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:49.069> had<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.250> little

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
poor and there was and it had a little

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.009 
poor and there was and it had a little
girl<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.660> white<00:02:51.079> hair<00:02:51.290> name<00:02:52.190> was

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
girl like with a white hair name was

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.960 
girl like with a white hair name was
leech<00:02:54.019> which<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.190> light<00:02:55.489> is

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
leech which is you know light is

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.660 
leech which is you know light is
translated<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.900> light<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.739> girl

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
translated as light and it's like a girl

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.750 
translated as light and it's like a girl
with<00:02:58.849> white<00:02:59.090> hair<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:00.049> I'm<00:03:01.010> guessing<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.610> is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
with white hair and I'm guessing this is

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.380 
with white hair and I'm guessing this is
like<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.030> princess<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.110> Dawson's<00:03:03.680> they

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.759 
like the princess of the Dawson's they
this<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.450> probably<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.140> guessing<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.709> I'm

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
this is probably one guessing and I'm

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.059 
this is probably one guessing and I'm
get<00:03:07.069> like<00:03:07.340> ll<00:03:08.150> was<00:03:08.599> like<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:08.930> love<00:03:09.140> with<00:03:09.200> her<00:03:09.500> or
