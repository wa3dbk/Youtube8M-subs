00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
5 6 7 8 come on guys we're talking about

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.360 
5 6 7 8 come on guys we're talking about
intense<00:00:32.880> muscular<00:00:33.660> contractions<00:00:34.380> snap<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
intense muscular contractions snap that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
intense muscular contractions snap that
damn<00:00:35.670> weight<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.480> try<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.469> many

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
damn weight up and try to get as many

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.940 
damn weight up and try to get as many
contractions<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.540> possible<00:00:39.840> before<00:00:40.800> your

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
contractions in as possible before your

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.369 
contractions in as possible before your
creatine<00:00:41.219> phosphate<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.300> ATP<00:00:42.660> run<00:00:43.200> out

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
creatine phosphate and ATP run out

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190 
creatine phosphate and ATP run out
that's<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.579> we're<00:00:44.730> talking<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.239> that's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that's what we're talking about that's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
that's what we're talking about that's
what's<00:00:46.469> important<00:00:47.180> ok<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
what's important ok because you have to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.490 
what's important ok because you have to
understand<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.879> muscle<00:00:51.420> has<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> limited

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
understand this the muscle has a limited

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.130 
understand this the muscle has a limited
energy<00:00:52.770> supply<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.539> form<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.840> creatine

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
energy supply in the form of creatine

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.939 
energy supply in the form of creatine
phosphate<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> lesser<00:00:56.640> extent<00:00:57.090> ATP<00:00:57.949> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
phosphate and to a lesser extent ATP so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.630 
phosphate and to a lesser extent ATP so
yes<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.030> could<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.449> three<00:01:01.109> reps<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> light

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
yes you could do three reps with a light

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
yes you could do three reps with a light
weight<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> last<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.650> 30<00:01:04.830> seconds

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
weight and have it last for 30 seconds

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.240 
weight and have it last for 30 seconds
and<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.939> feel<00:01:06.090> hard<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.710> wouldn't

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and it would feel hard but it wouldn't

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250 
and it would feel hard but it wouldn't
contract<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> muscle<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.479> intensely

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
contract the muscle that intensely

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
contract the muscle that intensely
meaning<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.189> damage<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.360> trauma<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
meaning the damage the trauma on the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.219 
meaning the damage the trauma on the
muscle<00:01:13.710> taking<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> lightweight<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.570> curling

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
muscle taking a lightweight and curling

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.249 
muscle taking a lightweight and curling
it<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.400> slow<00:01:20.240> will<00:01:21.240> eventually<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.900> hard

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it this slow will eventually get hard

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
it this slow will eventually get hard
and<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.040> eventually<00:01:23.220> burn<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.030> will

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and it will eventually burn it will

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
and it will eventually burn it will
eventually<00:01:24.270> hurt<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
eventually hurt but it's just not that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.899 
eventually hurt but it's just not that
difficult<00:01:26.810> ok<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.560> because<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.280> feels

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
difficult ok so just because it feels

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.929 
difficult ok so just because it feels
hard<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.170> can't<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> forever<00:01:32.100> doesn't

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
hard and you can't do it forever doesn't

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.380 
hard and you can't do it forever doesn't
mean<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.299> effective<00:01:34.079> training<00:01:35.240> because<00:01:36.240> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
mean it's effective training because we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.990 
mean it's effective training because we
have<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> limited<00:01:37.140> amount<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.710> fuel<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have a limited amount of fuel in the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.200 
have a limited amount of fuel in the
muscle<00:01:39.390> before<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.829> fuel<00:01:41.189> runs<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
muscle before that fuel runs out and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.260 
muscle before that fuel runs out and
every<00:01:42.810> time<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> contract<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> muscle<00:01:44.430> some

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
every time you contract the muscle some

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.600 
every time you contract the muscle some
of<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.509> fuel<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> being<00:01:46.140> used<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.250> want

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
of that fuel is being used so you want

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
of that fuel is being used so you want
to<00:01:47.700> contract<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.360> muscle<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:48.960> many<00:01:49.680> times<00:01:50.070> as

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to contract that muscle as many times as

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.109 
to contract that muscle as many times as
possible<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:51.500> intensely<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.590> possible<00:01:53.490> using

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
possible as intensely as possible using

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
possible as intensely as possible using
as<00:01:54.420> much<00:01:54.570> weight<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.020> possible<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:56.070> create<00:01:56.369> as

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
as much weight as possible to create as

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.630 
as much weight as possible to create as
much<00:01:57.119> growth<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.899> possible<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.369> guys

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
much growth as possible so when guys

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
much growth as possible so when guys
talk<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.240> lifting<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> certain<00:02:01.590> temp<00:02:01.950> own

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
talk about lifting at a certain temp own

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280 
talk about lifting at a certain temp own
it<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> hard<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.719> concentrating

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it really is hard you're concentrating

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.300 
he's doing
more<00:02:13.830> than<00:02:13.980> concentrating<00:02:14.840> okay<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> with

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
more than concentrating okay so with

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.030 
more than concentrating okay so with
regards<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.850> tempo<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:19.050> snap<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.410> weight<00:02:19.830> up

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
regards to tempo just snap the weight up

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.090 
regards to tempo just snap the weight up
lower<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.000> snap<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:22.080> that's<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
lower it and snap it up again that's the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.390 
lower it and snap it up again that's the
whole<00:02:23.130> concept<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.060> obviously<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
whole concept and obviously if it's so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.130 
whole concept and obviously if it's so
light<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.120> could<00:02:27.360> throw<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.870> through

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
light that you could throw it through

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.320 
light that you could throw it through
the<00:02:28.320> roof<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:29.250> that's<00:02:29.460> called<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.820> warm-up

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the roof then that's called a warm-up

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
the roof then that's called a warm-up
set<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.050> try<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> control<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.770> weight<00:02:31.890> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
set and you try to control the weight so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.950 
set and you try to control the weight so
you<00:02:32.130> don't<00:02:32.280> bang<00:02:32.700> yourself<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> face<00:02:33.690> with

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
you don't bang yourself in the face with

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.760 
you don't bang yourself in the face with
it<00:02:34.340> same<00:02:35.340> thing<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.670> any<00:02:35.970> other<00:02:36.240> exercise

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
it same thing with any other exercise

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.030 
it same thing with any other exercise
bench<00:02:37.770> press<00:02:38.220> squat<00:02:38.910> leg<00:02:39.450> press<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.680> doesn't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
bench press squat leg press it doesn't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
bench press squat leg press it doesn't
matter<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.340> use<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:42.090> bit<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.240> common

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
matter we use a little bit of common

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
matter we use a little bit of common
sense<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:43.080> life<00:02:43.260> okay<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> whole<00:02:44.580> concept

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
sense in life okay but the whole concept

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.750 
sense in life okay but the whole concept
is<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.650> remember<00:02:46.800> limited

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
is this you have to remember limited

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520 
is this you have to remember limited
amount<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.120> creatine<00:02:48.720> phosphate<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
amount of creatine phosphate in the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.590 
amount of creatine phosphate in the
muscle<00:02:49.830> that's<00:02:50.070> why<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.550> creatine<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
muscle that's why we take creatine to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600 
muscle that's why we take creatine to
overload<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.110> muscle<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.740> super<00:02:53.040> saturated

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
overload the muscle to super saturated

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.940 
overload the muscle to super saturated
so<00:02:54.240> we<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.960> more<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.530> creatine

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
so we have more of that creatine

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.070 
so we have more of that creatine
phosphate<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.300> an<00:02:57.450> extra<00:02:57.570> rep<00:02:57.900> for

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
phosphate so we can get an extra rep for

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.350 
phosphate so we can get an extra rep for
two<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.530> feel<00:02:58.770> stronger<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.180> don't

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
two and we feel stronger so we don't

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.320 
two and we feel stronger so we don't
want<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.570> waste<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.080> creatine<00:03:01.500> phosphate

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
want to waste that creatine phosphate

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.650 
want to waste that creatine phosphate
handling<00:03:03.330> lightweight<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.590> slow<00:03:05.190> reps<00:03:06.030> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
handling lightweight for slow reps and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.960 
handling lightweight for slow reps and
doing<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.380> kind<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.850> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
doing that kind of we want to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.480 
doing that kind of we want to
snap<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.510> weight<00:03:09.990> up<00:03:10.020> lower<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.800> snap<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.400> up

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
snap that weight up lower it snap it up

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.760 
snap that weight up lower it snap it up
again<00:03:11.790> bench<00:03:12.270> press<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.840> lower<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.380> bench

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
again bench press it lower it bench

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.980 
again bench press it lower it bench
press<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:14.310> again<00:03:14.670> try<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.360> sneak<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.870> as

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
press it up again try to sneak in as

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.070 
press it up again try to sneak in as
many<00:03:16.380> reps<00:03:16.800> as<00:03:17.180> possible<00:03:18.180> before<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
many reps as possible before that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320 
many reps as possible before that
creatine<00:03:19.410> phosphate<00:03:20.040> runs<00:03:20.310> out<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.790> more

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
creatine phosphate runs out and the more

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.450 
creatine phosphate runs out and the more
weight<00:03:21.600> we<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.990> handle<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.800> greater<00:03:23.130> those

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
weight we can handle the greater those

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.190 
weight we can handle the greater those
track<00:03:23.850> contractions<00:03:24.660> are<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.960> be

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
track contractions are going to be

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.860 
track contractions are going to be
before<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.340> creatine<00:03:26.670> phosphate<00:03:27.330> runs<00:03:27.600> out

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
before that creatine phosphate runs out

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.410 
before that creatine phosphate runs out
so<00:03:28.440> don't<00:03:28.890> worry<00:03:28.980> about<00:03:29.160> tempo<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.210> worry

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
so don't worry about tempo just worry

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000 
so don't worry about tempo just worry
about<00:03:30.480> getting<00:03:30.660> as<00:03:31.050> many<00:03:31.170> reps<00:03:31.500> as<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.650> can

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
about getting as many reps as you can

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.620 
about getting as many reps as you can
with<00:03:32.460> as<00:03:32.580> much<00:03:32.760> weight<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.270> can<00:03:33.420> handle

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
with as much weight as you can handle
