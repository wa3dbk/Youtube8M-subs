00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.609
 or the friends I am x nexus and the day of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
 today he will present a video tutorial 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.610
 of how to make our card 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.580
 video or envy the best graphics 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.920
 for the time to play good is a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 trick that I have learned and I'm going to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.460
 teach you so that also what 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.460
 can you do let's start 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.310
 well what aware the trick is 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.100
 have the nvidia driver installed 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.230
 As you all know to download the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.570
 driver link life we ​​just have to go to 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.150
 the official page to inhibit since it is 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.280
 nick villa dotcom and we enter and put 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.070
 the series of our card and we can 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.930
 deliver our drivers for free 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.820
 good after having installed the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.250
 drivers to you will have a panel of 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.550
 control is called plan there in panel 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.430
 control and then they go here on the side 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.920
 left where there is a little bit of lashes 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.400
 and you will see here what it says once is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.730
 adjust the image settings 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.790
 video of preview forgiveness and 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.130
 we will automatically open those to you 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.870
 will come here to let you follow the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.780
 application three days and then you 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.520
 they will come in good quality if you 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 they want the the the card is based 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.020
 more in quality or performance 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.180
 good in the case so that you what 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.640
 can really set the click here 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.950
 He tells us to use my preference 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.770
 emphasized and you can automatically 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.010
 move the bar below and here 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.800
 it will be to your liking it can be more quality 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.530
 more performance or it can also be 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.180
 regulated good in my case I have more 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.430
 performance because I like to play more 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.350
 Fluid games and not having much graphic 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.119
 in this case I that after having 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 put in performance I'll leave you in 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.960
 decide the application in 3d and 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.729
 it will automatically be saved 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.070
 and we're going to see it in apply and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.930
 it automatically saves after that 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.720
 we are going to put here to control the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.240
 3d configuration 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.910
 Y 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.890
 we will open a tab where it says 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.020
 global configuration and another where it says 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.250
 program configuration us 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
 let's build on the one that says 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.990
 global configuration and we're going to 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.420
 change here to everything in this symbol of 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.099
 nvidia in this case says 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 in multiple performance mode of 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.870
 screens we go here here and so on all 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.270
 we change and all change 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.970
 in all that appears does not appear 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.130
 here we will put you here and rehearsing is 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.750
 of my envy and we give him and then of 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.819
 that we're going to come with grew up from a 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.670
 program this is specifically how 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.219
 sorry the voice was approaching me 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.349
 specifically how to accelerate a game or 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.109
 a program in this case we're going to do to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.939
 a game and like now I do not have 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.630
 install a game because it's over 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.000
 thermal slut dora 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.970
 the only thing that a program should choose 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.770
 let's say that I have a program this and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.390
 let's put here the same thing we did 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.550
 in the previous the configuration index 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.770
 global we are going to put performance mode of 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.120
 single screen and so we go like this following 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.120
 changing where the seal is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.710
 sorry 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.350
 and so it concludes we configure our 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.230
 program or our game after that 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.750
 let's apply and it automatically goes 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.130
 to apply but in this case I have not 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.410
 done none has done nothing 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.480
 we could see that everything is how it was 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.490
 because I do not want to configure anything now 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.350
 we can also here configure in this 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.920
 part where it says by vibration from the south and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.270
 Disney as we can see here says no 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.580
 those who have connected 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.740
 sound settings or screens 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.780
 that have a game screen with 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.180
 audio here they get that configuration 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.690
 but my case I do not have that screen to me 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 I get the pei six which means a 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.260
 new thing for the game to be 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.590
 better it will be more fluid in this case 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.750
 if you want that 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.519
 Do you believe it most convenient for 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.389
 you must choose what you 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:20.299
 want and monthly the cpu the brand of 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.829
 my card or the model and it comes out 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.139
 automatic selection I recommend 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.850
 that they leave it automatic selection because 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.990
 if you leave it in automatic selection 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.190
 the graphics card can configure 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.470
 according to the games that are going to play 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.169
 but if you have got 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.590
 page configurations of how 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.000
 nvidia and things like characteristics 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.010
 cards and they know more about your card 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.470
 you can put the force kit 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.570
 because there they know where they are going to get more 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.560
 juice the card we can also say 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.960
 that the card also the new ones 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.080
 they use a new 1 processor that 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 llama cuda in this case I have the q da 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.160
 that's why I put him also for 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.860
 the brand of my card so that 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.870
 can accelerate more nor games around 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.090
 case after having put we are going to 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.639
 apply the ready after that we're going to 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.650
 where the configuration of the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.000
 video color and we will always put 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.610
 in configuration in my envy 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.380
 then we go below where it says 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.000
 image configuration we are also going to 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.310
 put it in all configurations of 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.289
 nvidia and we will automatically apply 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.630
 already sectarian and automatically it's going to 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.460
 make the graphics card have 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.050
 better better performance or better 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.470
 quality of agreement here you have 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.410
 configured after that we're going to do 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.450
 a little a little faster I do not tell them 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.700
 fast because it 's a little bit alone it's a 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.470
 useful program that is called 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.530
 and by experian 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.320
 the tutorial on how to download the equipment 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.150
 Hesperia is I'm going to teach in the 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.310
 next video 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.270
 that is, it was in the previous video but in 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.250
 finish 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.800
 on my channel the video of how to install 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.880
 team xperia and then we're going to 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.700
 open 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.750
 and automatically it's going to open we're going to 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.460
 wait a bit 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.350
 that this program always dies in 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.350
 April let's wait a bit 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.740
 excuse me yes 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.320
 good is opening and ready is 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.230
 opening the game of forgiveness the program 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:26.460
 I'm a little bad throat hope 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:30.690
 that they do not criticize me very good in everything 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.820
 case is a very essential branch is almost 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.380
 all the drivers bring them good in this 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.380
 case let's go where it says 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:41.070
 configurations or preferences and we're going to 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.870
 every one says games and you will put the 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.220
 route where they have their games and 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.290
 they will automatically go 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.370
 the game to the little ones that arrive and 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:54.740
 that game and here neither will the game and the 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.200
 auto optimized configuration that is the 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.750
 configuration that has more graphics and 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.900
 the lowest configuration and you 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.000
 can see which is the most convenient 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.340
 in any case I will teach them to use the 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.350
 more this program more more in another more 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.240
 go ahead in another video because in this 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.000
 case we do not have any game because 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.740
 I just formatted my computer in 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.330
 all case partner everything for this video and 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.670
 wait for them to subscribe to you in English 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.860
 this to this super video I hope that you 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.860
 I have served for ipad 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.930
 ah
