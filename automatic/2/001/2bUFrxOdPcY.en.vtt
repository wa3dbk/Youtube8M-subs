emotionally complicated I thought the

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.720 
emotionally complicated I thought the
way<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.469> episode<00:00:42.710> dealt<00:00:42.890> with<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.579> know<00:00:43.609> the

new doctor and Clara and their

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.110 
new doctor and Clara and their
relationship<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:45.410> really<00:00:45.980> interesting<00:00:46.399> but

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
relationship was really interesting but

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.819 
relationship was really interesting but
the<00:00:47.929> problems<00:00:48.230> with<00:00:48.379> deep<00:00:48.499> breath<00:00:48.679> for<00:00:48.710> me

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
the problems with deep breath for me

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.770 
the problems with deep breath for me
would<00:00:49.100> do<00:00:49.219> to<00:00:49.399> you<00:00:49.789> know<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.210> script<00:00:50.659> and

would do to you know the script and

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.220 
would do to you know the script and
pacing<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.739> feel<00:00:52.249> like<00:00:52.339> the<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.420> 80-minute

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230

felt like there were there were too many

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.599 
felt like there were there were too many
ideas<00:00:59.379> it<00:01:00.379> was<00:01:00.559> all<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.739> little<00:01:01.039> bit<00:01:01.219> jumbled

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
ideas it was all a little bit jumbled

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.309 
ideas it was all a little bit jumbled
and<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.329> pacing<00:01:02.690> was<00:01:02.749> offered<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.079> go<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.229> very

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
and the pacing was offered to go a very

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:04.810 
and the pacing was offered to go a very
long<00:01:03.589> time<00:01:03.859> for<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.100> episode<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.400> get<00:01:04.550> going

long time for the episode to get going

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.640 
long time for the episode to get going
only<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.540> if<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.659> think<00:01:05.840> 30<00:01:06.080> odd<00:01:06.200> minutes<00:01:06.230> in

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
only so if I think 30 odd minutes in

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.020 
only so if I think 30 odd minutes in
when<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.130> doctor<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.490> Clara<00:01:07.670> meet<00:01:07.850> for<00:01:08.000> lunch

when the doctor and Clara meet for lunch
and<00:01:08.270> they're<00:01:08.390> they're<00:01:08.570> reunited<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:09.260> kind

of descend deep under London only then

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.510 
of descend deep under London only then
does<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.900> episode<00:01:12.290> really<00:01:12.710> kick<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.340> gear

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
does the episode really kick up a gear

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.010 
does the episode really kick up a gear
maybe<00:01:14.090> it's<00:01:14.240> because<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.420> all<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:14.690> build-up

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
maybe it's because of all this build-up

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.450 
maybe it's because of all this build-up
and<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:15.290> huge<00:01:15.500> world<00:01:15.650> told<00:01:15.950> has<00:01:16.100> been<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.430> I

those doctors have made really kind of
supremely<00:01:30.640> confident<00:01:31.640> debuts<00:01:32.300> I<00:01:32.660> think<00:01:33.410> it's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
supremely confident debuts I think it's

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.460 
supremely confident debuts I think it's
obviously<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.160> very<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.300> know<00:01:35.330> big<00:01:35.690> role<00:01:35.960> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
obviously a very you know big role to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.050 
obviously a very you know big role to
take<00:01:36.650> on<00:01:36.830> particular<00:01:37.430> when<00:01:37.520> your<00:01:37.610> predecessor

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
take on particular when your predecessor

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060 
take on particular when your predecessor
has<00:01:38.180> been<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.870> popular<00:01:39.080> which<00:01:39.710> was<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.950> case

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
has been so popular which was the case

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.060 
has been so popular which was the case
for<00:01:40.100> Matt<00:01:40.370> Smith<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.000> for<00:01:41.270> Peter<00:01:41.510> Capaldi

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
for Matt Smith and now for Peter Capaldi

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.650 
for Matt Smith and now for Peter Capaldi
so<00:01:43.070> I<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.430> he<00:01:43.640> did<00:01:43.790> really<00:01:43.970> well<00:01:44.090> why<00:01:44.630> I

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
so I think he did really well why I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.940 
so I think he did really well why I
think's<00:01:44.870> interesting<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.440> way<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:45.680> it's

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
think's interesting is the way it's it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.250 
think's interesting is the way it's it's
written<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:47.150> by<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.360> end<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.720> the

trust him there's that whole issue of
did<00:02:13.099> he<00:02:13.219> push<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.640> villain<00:02:13.939> or<00:02:14.359> did<00:02:14.780> he<00:02:14.870> jump

did he push the villain or did he jump

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.320 
did he push the villain or did he jump
but<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.010> think<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.400> intention<00:02:16.700> i<00:02:16.940> think

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
but I think that's the intention i think

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.730 
but I think that's the intention i think
it's<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.690> unsettling<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.410> i<00:02:18.470> think<00:02:18.620> that's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's it's unsettling but i think that's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.400 
it's it's unsettling but i think that's
absolutely<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.190> intention<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
absolutely the intention that the this

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.390 
absolutely the intention that the this
character<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:21.800> one<00:02:21.980> that's<00:02:22.130> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.310> be

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
character is one that's going to be

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.670 
character is one that's going to be
developed<00:02:23.090> throughout<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.110> series<00:02:24.320> it's<00:02:24.620> not

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
developed throughout the series it's not

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.980 
developed throughout the series it's not
as<00:02:25.400> pat<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.880> easier<00:02:26.180> by<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.660> end<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.900> this

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
as pat and easier by the end of this

much<00:02:59.840> she<00:02:59.960> loved<00:03:00.140> him<00:03:00.350> why<00:03:00.710> he<00:03:00.860> loved<00:03:01.070> him<00:03:01.280> and

much she loved him why he loved him and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.940

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
think perhaps that that could be the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.250 
think perhaps that that could be the
hook<00:04:39.120> at<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.330> end<00:04:39.390> of<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.630> series<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.170> it

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
hook at the end of the series that it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.450 
hook at the end of the series that it
could<00:04:40.350> be<00:04:40.410> some<00:04:40.560> salvation<00:04:40.830> for<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> doctor

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
could be some salvation for the doctor

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.910 
could be some salvation for the doctor
saving<00:04:42.270> Jenna<00:04:42.660> perhaps<00:04:43.080> possibly<00:04:43.380> yeah<00:04:43.890> I

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920

don't really die they get brought back

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.310 
don't really die they get brought back
or<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.730> know<00:05:02.850> it's<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.510> half<00:05:03.750> death<00:05:04.080> if

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
or it's you know it's a half death if

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.880 
or it's you know it's a half death if
that's<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.620> thing<00:05:05.180> so<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.960> wouldn't<00:05:07.590> be<00:05:07.680> at<00:05:07.770> all

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
that's a thing so I I wouldn't be at all

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.350 
that's a thing so I I wouldn't be at all
surprised<00:05:08.220> if<00:05:08.400> Jenna<00:05:08.580> calm<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.880> does<00:05:09.030> leave<00:05:09.210> at

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
surprised if Jenna calm it does leave at

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.420 
surprised if Jenna calm it does leave at
the<00:05:09.420> end<00:05:09.450> of<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:09.690> series<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:11.010> that'll

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
the end of this series and that'll

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.310 
the end of this series and that'll
obviously<00:05:11.670> be<00:05:11.730> tied<00:05:11.910> into<00:05:12.140> Capaldi's<00:05:13.140> arc

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
obviously be tied into Capaldi's arc

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.550 
obviously be tied into Capaldi's arc
because<00:05:13.820> most<00:05:14.820> companion<00:05:15.630> actors<00:05:15.900> they<00:05:16.050> do<00:05:16.110> a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
because most companion actors they do a

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.080 
because most companion actors they do a
couple<00:05:17.040> of<00:05:17.130> series<00:05:17.340> maybe<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.730> little<00:05:17.880> less

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
couple of series maybe a little less

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.460 
couple of series maybe a little less
maybe<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.390> little<00:05:18.480> more<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:18.840> Billie<00:05:19.140> Piper

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
maybe a little more I think Billie Piper

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.740 
maybe a little more I think Billie Piper
did<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.800> Karen<00:05:20.790> Gillan<00:05:21.120> did<00:05:21.270> about<00:05:21.450> two<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.690> a

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
did to Karen Gillan did about two and a

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.510 
did to Karen Gillan did about two and a
half<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.470> I<00:05:22.500> wouldn't<00:05:22.890> be<00:05:22.950> at<00:05:23.130> all<00:05:23.220> surprised

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
half so I wouldn't be at all surprised

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.220 
half so I wouldn't be at all surprised
if<00:05:23.640> Jenna<00:05:24.270> comments<00:05:24.600> on<00:05:24.660> her<00:05:24.780> way<00:05:24.900> out<00:05:24.930> and

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
if Jenna comments on her way out and

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.260 
if Jenna comments on her way out and
that<00:05:25.830> will<00:05:26.010> absolutely<00:05:26.280> play<00:05:26.820> into<00:05:27.090> how

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
that will absolutely play into how

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.810 
that will absolutely play into how
Capaldi's<00:05:28.260> doctor<00:05:28.460> develops<00:05:29.460> as<00:05:29.610> will

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
Capaldi's doctor develops as will

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.220 
Capaldi's doctor develops as will
presumably<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.600> introduction<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.200> new

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
presumably the introduction of a new

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.690 
presumably the introduction of a new
companion<00:05:31.710> as<00:05:31.800> well<00:05:31.950> and<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:32.370> we<00:05:32.460> started

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
companion as well and so we started

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.760 
companion as well and so we started
early<00:05:33.000> betting<00:05:33.210> one<00:05:33.480> who's<00:05:34.080> gonna<00:05:34.260> replace<00:05:34.410> to
