made me think gosh where were you when I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
made me think gosh where were you when I
was<00:00:35.370> looking<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> new<00:00:36.149> saddle<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.809> road

was looking for a new saddle for my road

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.190 
was looking for a new saddle for my road
bike<00:00:37.020> years<00:00:37.530> ago<00:00:38.149> basically<00:00:39.149> any<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
bike years ago basically any time in the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.720 
bike years ago basically any time in the
first<00:00:40.410> 4<00:00:40.620> months<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
first 4 months if you don't like it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.380 
first 4 months if you don't like it
bring<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> I'm<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.520> try<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.059> one

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
bring it back so I'm gonna try this one

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990 
bring it back so I'm gonna try this one
out<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.280> comfortable<00:00:47.579> as

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
out and see if it's as comfortable as

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770 
out and see if it's as comfortable as
they<00:00:48.270> claim<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.500> made<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> gel<00:00:51.480> called

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
they claim it's a made with a gel called

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
they claim it's a made with a gel called
royal<00:00:52.079> gel<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:53.219> absorbs<00:00:53.850> instead

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
royal gel which actually absorbs instead

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.459 
royal gel which actually absorbs instead
of<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.050> bouncing<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.860> absorbs<00:00:56.789> any<00:00:57.000> energy

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
of just bouncing back absorbs any energy

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.360 
of just bouncing back absorbs any energy
so<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.829> put<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> saddle<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.149> bike<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
so I put the saddle on the bike and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.439 
so I put the saddle on the bike and
actually<00:01:02.370> when<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.699> installed<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.329> would

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
actually when it was installed it would

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
actually when it was installed it would
still<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.930> quite<00:01:04.229> adjusted<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
still not quite adjusted right it's a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.719 
still not quite adjusted right it's a
little<00:01:06.390> bit<00:01:06.540> tilted<00:01:07.049> forward<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.610> not

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
little bit tilted forward so it's not

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
little bit tilted forward so it's not
quite<00:01:09.000> flat<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.869> quite<00:01:10.710> far<00:01:11.100> enough

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
quite flat and it's not quite far enough

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
quite flat and it's not quite far enough
back<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.909> me<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> go<00:01:12.990> ahead<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
back for me so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.120 
back for me so I'm going to go ahead and
adjust<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.750> now<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> adjust<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.409> saddle<00:01:16.680> like

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
adjust it now to adjust the saddle like

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.240 
adjust it now to adjust the saddle like
this<00:01:17.369> there's<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.090> allen<00:01:18.900> key<00:01:19.140> bolt<00:01:19.710> underneath

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
this there's a allen key bolt underneath

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
this there's a allen key bolt underneath
here<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.840> here's<00:01:21.840> my<00:01:21.990> trusty<00:01:22.470> freeway<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
here and here's my trusty freeway this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.920 
here and here's my trusty freeway this
is<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.900> six<00:01:24.920> side<00:01:25.920> signaling<00:01:26.610> key<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> just

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is a six side signaling key and you just

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.359 
is a six side signaling key and you just
put<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.130> loosen<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.030> bolt

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
put it in here and you loosen this bolt

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.910 
put it in here and you loosen this bolt
here<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.930> don't<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.650> with

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
here I don't know if I can do this with

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.820 
here I don't know if I can do this with
the<00:01:35.040> video<00:01:35.460> holding<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> video

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
the video holding the video

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.820 
the video holding the video
there<00:01:37.370> we<00:01:37.430> go<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:39.440> no<00:01:39.560> loosen<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.010> bolt<00:01:41.830> and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
there we go so no loosen this bolt and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.230 
there we go so no loosen this bolt and
essentially<00:01:43.310> what<00:01:43.460> that's<00:01:43.670> doing<00:01:43.910> is

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
essentially what that's doing is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.570 
essentially what that's doing is
loosening<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:44.900> clamp<00:01:45.290> right<00:01:45.500> here<00:01:45.770> which

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
loosening this clamp right here which

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.090 
loosening this clamp right here which
holds<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.000> saddle<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.480> place

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.560 

now<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.310> saddle<00:01:54.670> actually<00:01:55.030> has<00:01:55.210> little

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
now this saddle actually has little

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.969 
now this saddle actually has little
measuring<00:01:56.259> thing<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.619> probably

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
measuring thing on it here you probably

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.870 
measuring thing on it here you probably
I<00:02:00.039> don't<00:02:00.100> know<00:02:00.220> if<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.399> can<00:02:00.549> see<00:02:00.700> those

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
I don't know if you can see those

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.760 
I don't know if you can see those
numbers<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.630> actually<00:02:01.810> has<00:02:02.140> numbers<00:02:02.560> you

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
numbers but it actually has numbers you

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.649 
numbers but it actually has numbers you
can<00:02:02.920> see<00:02:03.159> where<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.490> at<00:02:03.670> now<00:02:04.360> I've<00:02:04.450> loosened

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
can see where it's at now I've loosened

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.740 
can see where it's at now I've loosened
it<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> bit<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.369> can<00:02:07.299> just<00:02:07.420> kind<00:02:07.659> of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
it a bit and now I can just kind of

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:19.309 
it a bit and now I can just kind of
slide<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.200> back<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.869> bit

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.229 

and<00:02:19.530> also<00:02:20.189> underneath<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.939> there's<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
and also underneath here there's a

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.990 
and also underneath here there's a
little<00:02:21.360> Chuck<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:23.220> order<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.579> adjust<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
little Chuck that in order to adjust the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.149 
little Chuck that in order to adjust the
angle<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:25.079> have<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.409> adjust<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.890> little

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
angle you have to adjust this little

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.369 
angle you have to adjust this little
chalk<00:02:26.459> under<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.689> I'm<00:02:27.989> actually<00:02:28.110> gonna

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
chalk under here and I'm actually gonna

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.869 
chalk under here and I'm actually gonna
have<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> put<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.799> video<00:02:29.010> down<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.280> order<00:02:29.670> to

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
have to put the video down in order to

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.809 
have to put the video down in order to
do<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.569> hold<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.049> second

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
do that so hold on one second

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.399 
do that so hold on one second
okay<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.510> adjust<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.870> angle<00:02:34.049> there<00:02:34.379> I

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
okay and to adjust the angle there I

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.009 
okay and to adjust the angle there I
couldn't<00:02:34.829> do<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.670> hand<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.780> little

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
couldn't do it one hand but this little

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.880 
couldn't do it one hand but this little
part<00:02:37.319> here<00:02:37.379> this<00:02:37.829> little<00:02:38.010> u<00:02:38.370> part<00:02:39.560> moves<00:02:40.560> in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
part here this little u part moves in

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
part here this little u part moves in
relation<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.549> stem<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.480> kind<00:02:42.690> of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
relation to the stem so you can kind of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.380 
relation to the stem so you can kind of
twist<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.769> forward<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.549> back<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.090> will

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
twist it forward and back and that will

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.170 
twist it forward and back and that will
change<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.900> angle<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.739> saddle<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:47.819> when

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
change the angle of the saddle and when

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.449 
change the angle of the saddle and when
you're<00:02:48.329> putting<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.689> saddle<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.980> want<00:02:50.189> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
you're putting a saddle on you want it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.910 
you're putting a saddle on you want it
to<00:02:50.609> be<00:02:50.840> about<00:02:51.840> parallel<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> ground

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
to be about parallel to the ground

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.000 
to be about parallel to the ground
that's<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.549> top<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.450> saddle<00:02:54.840> parallel<00:02:55.799> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that's the top of the saddle parallel to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.819 
that's the top of the saddle parallel to
the<00:02:56.129> ground<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.849> most<00:02:57.030> comfort<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.560> then

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
the ground for the most comfort and then

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.289 
the ground for the most comfort and then
you<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.069> move<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> forward<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.849> backward<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
you can move it forward and backward a

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.259 
you can move it forward and backward a
little<00:03:00.510> bit<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:01.549> adjust<00:03:02.549> your<00:03:02.700> position

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
little bit to adjust your position

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.849 
little bit to adjust your position
relative<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.049> pedals<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
relative to the pedals and the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.470 
relative to the pedals and the
handlebars<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:05.909> comfortable

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
handlebars to get it more comfortable

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.599 
handlebars to get it more comfortable
now<00:03:07.170> when<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.349> had<00:03:07.530> put<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.829> on<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.430> was<00:03:08.579> a

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
now when I had put this on it was a

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.110 
now when I had put this on it was a
little<00:03:08.940> bit<00:03:09.389> tilted<00:03:09.629> forward<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.349> slightly

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
little bit tilted forward just slightly

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.330 
little bit tilted forward just slightly
and<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.170> made<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.319> feel<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.680> when<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.220> was

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and that made it feel like when I was

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.830 
and that made it feel like when I was
sitting<00:03:14.639> on<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.849> seat<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.269> was<00:03:15.450> sliding

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
sitting on the seat that I was sliding

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.740 
sitting on the seat that I was sliding
forward<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:17.670> was<00:03:17.819> also<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.150> little<00:03:18.389> too<00:03:18.510> far

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
forward and it was also a little too far

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.250 
forward and it was also a little too far
forward<00:03:19.109> which<00:03:20.629> put<00:03:21.629> me<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> little<00:03:22.019> bit<00:03:22.109> too

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
forward which put me a little bit too

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.659 
forward which put me a little bit too
close<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> handlebars<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.519> made<00:03:23.639> a

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
close to the handlebars and made a

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.089 
close to the handlebars and made a
little<00:03:23.790> uncomfortable<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.480> pedaling<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.739> just

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
little uncomfortable so pedaling so just

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.949 
little uncomfortable so pedaling so just
a<00:03:26.220> small<00:03:26.370> adjustment<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.299> just<00:03:27.510> moved<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.840> back

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
a small adjustment I just moved it back

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.259 
a small adjustment I just moved it back
about<00:03:28.230> half<00:03:28.500> an<00:03:28.650> inch<00:03:28.769> made<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.310> level<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.819> think

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
about half an inch made it level I think

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.819 
about half an inch made it level I think
it's<00:03:30.510> gonna<00:03:30.599> make<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> big<00:03:30.930> difference<00:03:31.290> for

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
it's gonna make a big difference for

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.309 
it's gonna make a big difference for
riding<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.730> bike<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.389> this<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.109> kind

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
riding on the bike and this is the kind

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.199 
riding on the bike and this is the kind
of<00:03:34.379> thing<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.919> lot<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> people<00:03:35.609> who<00:03:36.090> are

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
of thing that a lot of people who are

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.180 
of thing that a lot of people who are
more<00:03:36.540> novice<00:03:36.930> bikers<00:03:37.349> probably<00:03:37.859> don't<00:03:38.069> even

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
more novice bikers probably don't even

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.759 
more novice bikers probably don't even
think<00:03:38.549> about<00:03:38.639> but<00:03:39.419> when<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.660> comes<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.169> comfort

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
think about but when it comes to comfort

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.849 
think about but when it comes to comfort
of<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.980> bike<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.849> Sun<00:03:42.290> that's<00:03:43.290> an<00:03:43.470> important

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
of a bike that Sun that's an important

of a bike that Sun that's an important
thing<00:03:43.889> so<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:44.879> how<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.120> adjust<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.660> cell<00:03:45.900> and
