00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.520
 a chicken with that long yard that goes to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 antofagasta that is on the sea but flat 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.720
 before the finish there is also a dune in that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.070
 start about behind me in that there 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.349
 all the way down 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 it is a day that we hope the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 bad luck devil 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.930
 the eurol veka man rally team one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.190
 this happened today 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.410
 to stick 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.899
 this evoke that what for the web 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.750
 so then said still busy 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.180
 god thank you very much 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.580
 hello hello 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.990
 October 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.680
 well you had sustained 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.780
 See what have been no right 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780
 nothing to 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.420
 the rocks pedro 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.750
 face on the paul trucks well what peter 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.750
 paul it again 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470
 film aprilis 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 photo 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.870
 yes afterwards are very happy with 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.610
 qualification of course already soft it 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.780
 start and not so out because yes 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.370
 then came through greeted 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.050
 but while the dunes are through it is one 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.240
 whole miss waypoint 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.830
 So they had the dunes back to it 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.910
 the waypoint therefore pays some time there 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.580
 lost 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 And all the toppers for and against 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.070
 as soon as he 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.130
 game is a good ranking points 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.860
 therefore the second part of the test 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.080
 Day also they tried me 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.370
 if pace reach to increase your 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.650
 hold that position and that is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.760
 reasonably successful so we are happy 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.180
 here are an eye catcher 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.700
 let boat paints do marcel immediately 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.410
 then there are also from the i can be there long 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.600
 short or something too long story or 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.430
 too short for today the whole 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.900
 story is very long but I can have one 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.730
 very briefly 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.170
 Well today just can't do things 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.240
 terribly hard 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.760
 until we compared ours to something 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.110
 dintop while our fixed reason so too 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.350
 very long before the other tricks year 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.269
 and only one 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.430
 great games have been down what 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.790
 that just did not work so we have 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.090
 they usually drove to the finish 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.140
 we together again so three days and we 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.290
 go for the boys to the finish 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.290
 to drive 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.560

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.560
 poland baden-powell in camps service 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.970
 to see my boy's number buddy well 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.540
 then we go to the 505 van 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.770
 Peter Versluis suddenly turns out to be everything 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600
 to be wrong 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.520
 first one camera breaks down and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.980
 then the other also collapses 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.900
 then it goes completely wrong and chris 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.850
 finally the car with 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.790
 reasonably serious consequences among others 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.980
 for navigator jÃ¼rgen dame end of rally 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.290
 for Peter Versluis 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.990
 yes this is a rally yes i think and 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.610
 knowing especially after pars and driving 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.450

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.000

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.350

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.860
 today and we are fixing speed 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.930
 again just how you need it 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.750

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.990
 so angel that 2033 last days later 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.230
 quite a part of me there 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.830
 but well it is still my 17 churches there 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.830

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.830
 tl she will here is a cane it was good 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.290
 but it really came very pep talk 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.870
 do you do that good helicopter idea 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.360

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:11.830
 shot with a lot of problems and yes 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:14.560
