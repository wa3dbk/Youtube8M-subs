bum-rush<00:00:03.750> combo<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:04.620> some<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.009> guys<00:00:05.130> are

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
bum-rush combo now some of you guys are

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.860 
bum-rush combo now some of you guys are
probably<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:06.000> know<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.420> trick<00:00:06.720> I've

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
probably going I know this trick I've

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
probably going I know this trick I've
been<00:00:07.049> doing<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.470> since<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.830> beta<00:00:08.099> but<00:00:08.700> you

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
been doing this since the beta but you

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
been doing this since the beta but you
probably<00:00:09.059> don't<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.050> increases

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
probably don't know that this increases

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
probably don't know that this increases
the range<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.670> leap<00:00:12.090> damage<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.049> you'll<00:00:13.200> see

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the range of leap damage so you'll see

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.530 
the range of leap damage so you'll see
here<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> second<00:00:14.040> I'm<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.880> leap<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
here in a second I'm going to leap to a

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.930 
here in a second I'm going to leap to a
target<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.109> I'm<00:00:16.320> clearly<00:00:17.160> out<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.400> range<00:00:17.730> my

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
target and I'm clearly out of range my

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.220 
target and I'm clearly out of range my
Leap<00:00:18.150> damage<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.660> not<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> hit<00:00:19.109> this

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
Leap damage was not going to hit this

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
Leap damage was not going to hit this
target<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> bum-rush<00:00:20.900> three-fourths<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
target but I bum-rush three-fourths of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
target but I bum-rush three-fourths of
the<00:00:22.020> way<00:00:22.170> through<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.380> leap<00:00:22.590> cast<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.250> my

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the way through the leap cast and my

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.480 
the way through the leap cast and my
Leap<00:00:24.180> damage<00:00:24.660> hits<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.740> end<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.310> my

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
Leap damage hits at the very end of my

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.790 
Leap damage hits at the very end of my
bum<00:00:26.699> rush<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> something<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.590> just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
bum rush now this is something I just

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800 
bum rush now this is something I just
figured<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> long<00:00:29.519> time<00:00:29.580> ago<00:00:29.820> by<00:00:30.210> accident

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
figured out a long time ago by accident

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
figured out a long time ago by accident
and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.349> had<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> few<00:00:31.710> people<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.160> stream<00:00:32.430> go

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and I had a few people on my stream go

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.240 
and I had a few people on my stream go
whoa<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:33.030> did<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.800> thought

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
whoa how did you do that and I thought

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.380 
whoa how did you do that and I thought
you<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.579> lot<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> people<00:00:35.880> knew<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you know a lot of people knew about this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
you know a lot of people knew about this
but<00:00:36.570> apparently<00:00:36.950> most<00:00:37.950> people<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.340> know

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but apparently most people don't know

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.709 
but apparently most people don't know
about<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.790> trick<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> extending<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
about the little trick of extending the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
about the little trick of extending the
leap<00:00:39.899> damage<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.430> neat<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.730> trick

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
leap damage and the neat little trick

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
leap damage and the neat little trick
it's<00:00:42.480> useful<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.989> fight<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.320> curry

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it's useful for a fight like curry

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.840 
it's useful for a fight like curry
lacquer<00:00:43.800> basically<00:00:44.040> any<00:00:44.430> fight<00:00:44.700> with

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
lacquer basically any fight with

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
lacquer basically any fight with
movement<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.570> free<00:00:45.809> damage<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
movement it's free damage because by the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
movement it's free damage because by the
time<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.340> target<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.969> leap

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
time you get to your target your leap

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
time you get to your target your leap
global<00:00:48.899> cooldown<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
global cooldown is up and you can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
global cooldown is up and you can
instantly<00:00:50.640> attack<00:00:50.969> you'll<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
instantly attack you'll see that in the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.590 
instantly attack you'll see that in the
slow<00:00:52.350> mo<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:53.309> leap<00:00:53.579> bum-rush<00:00:54.239> boom

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
slow mo that gonna leap bum-rush boom

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
slow mo that gonna leap bum-rush boom
damage<00:00:55.110> hits<00:00:55.350> global<00:00:55.770> cooldown<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
damage hits global cooldown is up and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
damage hits global cooldown is up and
I'm<00:00:56.789> ready<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> swing<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:57.809> free<00:00:58.260> damage

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I'm ready to swing so it's free damage

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.220 
I'm ready to swing so it's free damage
it's<00:00:59.430> really<00:01:00.180> good<00:01:00.329> movement<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.989> way<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it's really good movement the way the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.310 
it's really good movement the way the
trick<00:01:01.440> works<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.980> bum<00:01:02.910> rush<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> unique

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
trick works is that bum rush is a unique

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
trick works is that bum rush is a unique
ability<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.799> where<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:06.090> triggers<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.720> global

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
ability to where it triggers a global

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
ability to where it triggers a global
cooldown<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> does<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.400> require<00:01:08.729> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
cooldown but it does not require a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
cooldown but it does not require a
global<00:01:09.450> cooldown<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> could

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
global cooldown to be up so you could

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
global cooldown to be up so you could
use<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.400> any<00:01:11.610> time<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.479> any

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
use it at any time you want to at any

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.780 
use it at any time you want to at any
point<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.380> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.400> bum<00:01:14.610> rush

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
point you want to you can bum rush

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
point you want to you can bum rush
whereas<00:01:15.119> leap<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> rigid<00:01:16.200> solid<00:01:16.710> global

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
whereas leap is a rigid solid global

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
whereas leap is a rigid solid global
cooldown<00:01:17.460> where<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.119> can't<00:01:18.360> use<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> while

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
cooldown where you can't use it while

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.179 
cooldown where you can't use it while
you're<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:18.990> global<00:01:19.320> cooldown<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.830> also

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you're on global cooldown it also

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.789 
you're on global cooldown it also
triggers<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.110> leap<00:01:22.500> then

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
triggers one so it's got to be leap then

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.149 
triggers one so it's got to be leap then
bum-rush<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.490> bum<00:01:23.729> rush<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.210> leap<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.159> yeah

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
bum-rush not bum rush then leap so yeah

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.070 
bum-rush not bum rush then leap so yeah
that's<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.850> works<00:01:27.119> hope<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> guys
