00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.200
 see here now i will cook very much 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.950
 simple and easy yeast 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.630
 dough and we will start 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:22.199
 custody I will use 50 grams 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 fresh yeast and I'll sprinkle them dining 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 spoon of sugar and at once but they can be so 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.820
 leave for a couple of minutes and you can rub 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.820
 does not react with sugar and becomes liquid 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.180
 I used 50 grams of yeast and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:59.219
 tablespoon of sugar now I add 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:01:02.640
 a teaspoon of salt 1 egg and on such 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.700
 the amount of ingredients I add 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.390
 a glass of liquid it could be milk 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:21.570
 water or my case I breed 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 sour with food and give and immediately indicate 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.110
 a hand 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 and the test I'm already there cool males when its 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:53.840
 it will be very difficult to interfere with a spoon of dough 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 grabbed turned into such a mass 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.160

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.399
 sunflower oil and knead you all 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.399

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.269

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.609
 it takes literally 5 minutes and it is ready 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.400
 when I use this dough for pies 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.799
