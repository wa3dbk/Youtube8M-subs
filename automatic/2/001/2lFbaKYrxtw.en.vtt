opening now this one does not have the
latch<00:00:50.340> again<00:00:50.700> which<00:00:50.850> means<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.270> probably

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
latch again which means it's probably

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.770 
latch again which means it's probably
inside<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:53.010> strange<00:00:53.430> once<00:00:53.850> more<00:00:54.149> so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.970 
very loose and Oliver so I can get full
range<00:02:13.379> chance

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
range chance

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.080 
range chance
of<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.560> can't<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.879> you<00:02:17.879> just

of all of it like can't see you just
scream<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.269> round<00:02:18.599> I'm<00:02:19.220> floating<00:02:20.220> over

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
scream that round I'm floating over

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.400 
scream that round I'm floating over
tracks<00:02:20.849> behind<00:02:21.120> me<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.599> I'm<00:02:21.690> having<00:02:21.900> trouble

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
tracks behind me so I'm having trouble

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 
tracks behind me so I'm having trouble
just<00:02:22.440> doing<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:24.120> already<00:02:24.150> built<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
just doing this I have already built the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.119 
just doing this I have already built the
layout<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.560> tight<00:02:25.769> over<00:02:26.040> here

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
layout and it's a little tight over here

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.680 
layout and it's a little tight over here
but<00:02:26.400> anyways<00:02:26.670> that's<00:02:26.879> not<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> point

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
but anyways that's not the point

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.580 
but anyways that's not the point
so<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.830> yeah<00:02:29.580> there<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.849> go<00:02:30.349> very<00:02:31.349> loose

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so if I just yeah there we go very loose

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070 
so if I just yeah there we go very loose
but<00:02:31.860> there's<00:02:32.730> only<00:02:32.849> one<00:02:33.150> front<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.840> then

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
but there's only one front and then

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.360 
but there's only one front and then
there's<00:02:34.230> Oliver<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.780> bottom<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:38.190> this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
there's Oliver on the bottom now this

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.550 
there's Oliver on the bottom now this
thing<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.550> primarily<00:02:39.239> made<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.630> plastic<00:02:40.170> sadly

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
thing is primarily made of plastic sadly

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.289 
thing is primarily made of plastic sadly
this<00:02:41.519> footplate<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.019> guess<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.340> balance<00:02:45.150> of

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
this footplate or I guess the balance of

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.600 
this footplate or I guess the balance of
it<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.629> plate<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.380> all<00:02:46.500> plastic<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:47.459> is

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
it the plate it's all plastic this is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.020 
it the plate it's all plastic this is
all<00:02:47.790> plastic<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.470> wood<00:02:49.849> it's<00:02:50.849> got

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
all plastic and this is wood it's got

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.759 
all plastic and this is wood it's got
very<00:02:51.269> nice<00:02:51.450> detail<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.319> will<00:02:52.500> give<00:02:52.680> it

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
very nice detail on it so I will give it

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.990 
very nice detail on it so I will give it
Mattel<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:54.440> spectacular<00:02:55.440> detail<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.880> then

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
Mattel that spectacular detail and then

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.870 
Mattel that spectacular detail and then
there's<00:02:57.180> bread<00:02:57.390> wheels<00:02:57.650> which<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:59.250> mean<00:02:59.579> he

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
there's bread wheels which is I mean he

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.180 
there's bread wheels which is I mean he
does<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.090> red<00:03:00.450> wheels<00:03:00.660> in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.500> CGI<00:03:01.920> series

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
does have red wheels in the CGI series

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.000 
does have red wheels in the CGI series
but<00:03:02.910> he<00:03:02.970> does<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.390> treads<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.890> can

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
but he does have treads and as you can

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.309 
but he does have treads and as you can
see<00:03:05.130> no<00:03:05.489> treads<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.840> that's<00:03:06.989> probably<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
see no treads and that's probably the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.530 
see no treads and that's probably the
reason<00:03:07.410> behind<00:03:07.819> kids<00:03:08.819> would<00:03:08.970> usually<00:03:09.060> lose

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
reason behind kids would usually lose

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.660 
reason behind kids would usually lose
the<00:03:09.750> treads<00:03:10.049> or<00:03:10.290> Mattel<00:03:11.280> was<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.519> really

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the treads or Mattel was just really

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.759 
the treads or Mattel was just really
lazy<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.180> give<00:03:12.360> them<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> different<00:03:13.200> wheel<00:03:13.470> base

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
lazy to give them a different wheel base

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.960 
lazy to give them a different wheel base
Oh<00:03:15.079> Mattel<00:03:16.079> oh<00:03:16.370> oh<00:03:17.370> well<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.760> still

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
Oh Mattel oh oh well it's it's still

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.000 
Oh Mattel oh oh well it's it's still
really<00:03:21.150> nice<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.290> working<00:03:22.500> scoop

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
really nice and then the working scoop

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.129 
really nice and then the working scoop
it's<00:03:23.430> really<00:03:23.730> nice<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.630> if<00:03:24.810> they<00:03:24.930> were<00:03:25.019> to

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
it's really nice because if they were to

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's really nice because if they were to
release<00:03:25.290> Alfie<00:03:25.889> I'm<00:03:25.980> sure<00:03:26.220> elf<00:03:26.459> eases<00:03:28.160> scoop

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
release Alfie I'm sure elf eases scoop

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.620 
release Alfie I'm sure elf eases scoop
and<00:03:29.340> everything<00:03:29.670> would<00:03:29.819> be<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.060> exact<00:03:30.420> same

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
and everything would be the exact same

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.780 
and everything would be the exact same
as<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:32.280> think<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.519> goes<00:03:32.639> on

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
as this so this is I think it goes on

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
as this so this is I think it goes on
lower<00:03:33.470> yeah<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:35.519> works<00:03:36.530> Scoob<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:38.510> yes<00:03:39.510> no

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
lower yeah that works Scoob or yes no

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.110 
lower yeah that works Scoob or yes no
it's<00:03:40.200> pretty<00:03:40.859> stiff<00:03:41.340> right<00:03:41.579> here<00:03:41.819> going<00:03:42.780> down

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
it's pretty stiff right here going down

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120 
it's pretty stiff right here going down
yeah<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.359> actually<00:03:45.660> really<00:03:45.870> stiff<00:03:46.319> but

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
yeah it's actually really stiff but

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.390 
yeah it's actually really stiff but
anyways<00:03:47.549> that<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.970> Oliver<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.950> that's<00:03:50.160> very

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
anyways that is Oliver so that's very

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.090 
anyways that is Oliver so that's very
nice<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.850> see<00:03:52.010> next<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.810> 2014<00:03:54.810> Oliver<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
nice to see next is the 2014 Oliver and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.890 
nice to see next is the 2014 Oliver and
I<00:03:56.160> believe<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> same<00:03:57.239> exact<00:03:57.630> thing

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
I believe this is the same exact thing

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.400 
I believe this is the same exact thing
as<00:03:58.200> these<00:03:58.680> tell<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.549> braved<00:03:59.910> Oliver's<00:04:00.660> fossil

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
as these tell the braved Oliver's fossil

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.530 
as these tell the braved Oliver's fossil
find<00:04:01.709> or<00:04:02.400> discovery<00:04:02.819> or<00:04:03.000> delivery<00:04:03.450> or

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
find or discovery or delivery or

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930 
find or discovery or delivery or
whatever<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.900> called<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:05.130> yeah<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.549> still

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
whatever it's called so yeah I still

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.199 
whatever it's called so yeah I still
really<00:04:06.389> like<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:07.579> different<00:04:08.579> from<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
really like it it's different from the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.409 
really like it it's different from the
2000<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.290> 2004<00:04:10.980> smelting<00:04:11.639> yard<00:04:11.910> Oliver

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
2000 this is a 2004 smelting yard Oliver

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.640 
2000 this is a 2004 smelting yard Oliver
or<00:04:13.319> 2005<00:04:14.299> one<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.389> those<00:04:15.480> years<00:04:15.720> but<00:04:16.079> there's<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
or 2005 one of those years but there's a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.870 
or 2005 one of those years but there's a
big<00:04:17.190> change<00:04:17.639> like<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.750> an<00:04:18.870> improvement<00:04:19.260> I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
big change like is it an improvement I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.630 
big change like is it an improvement I
believe<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.419> also<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.830> do<00:04:22.890> really<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.430> do

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
believe so but also I do really I do

I suppose hey I guess it does a lot of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.249

people like to use it in their series so
I<00:04:49.560> take<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.189> that<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.340> lot<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.669> people<00:04:50.909> like<00:04:51.000> this

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
I take it that a lot of people like this

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.260

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
trying to take guesses here and it's

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.110
