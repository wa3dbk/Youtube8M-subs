00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.799
 good afternoon dear friends continue our 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.839
 talk about the plein air today I would like 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.959
 give you some tips for that 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.059
 to make your record more vivid and 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.189
 clean when you work on an example 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.810
 my first advice concerns not even 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.380
 batches on the palette 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.150
 a very simple thing is a cap when you 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.699
 working on an example necessarily 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.160
 use a wide hat 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.430
 fields that will protect your 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.110
 eyes from being hit by sunlight even 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.140
 if you work in the shade 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 you definitely need a cap which 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.090
 will protect your eyesight a little bit 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.940
 from the falling light rays and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 how would you focus a little bit on that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.030
 landscapes that you observe and so 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.410
 tip 2 be sure to wear a hat 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.780
 wide brim 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 second tip concerns thinners 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.290
 which you use in the open air 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.530
 be sure to use 2 thinners 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.470
 first you dilute the paint do it 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 a bit thinner if needed and a second second 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.159
 thinner used for washing 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.189
 brushes that is to brush 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.890
 Naturally after paint clear you 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 you need to wash it if you have 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 only one tank and if you and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.070
 wash the brush and dilute 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 edits with one thinner then in 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.590
 get a dirty muddy color as a result 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.060
 so remember the simple rule in 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.759
 one capacity we 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.340
 thinner brush my it can be 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.649
 pinin this could be white spirit 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 turpentine kerosene anything than you 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.750
 wash your brush and in the second in the second 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.040
 tanks you contain either oil or 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.189
 tee either too 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.740
 thinner but it is just to 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.649
 paint thin the next tip 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.649
 relates directly to working with 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.390
 palette I recommend to lay out paint 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.330
 on the palette consistently 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.630
 so that they are located from 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.300
 warm cold and represented 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.390
 rainbow row so let's say very familiar 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.140
 us yellow red purple blue 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.210
 green 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.640
 Separately recommend putting white and 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.580
 black if black you use paints 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.320
 put on the edge of the palette in groups 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.970
 then when mixed 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.650
 take the paint off the edge of that pile and 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.040
 knead in the center of the palette so 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.410
 way you will stay clean here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.840
 an array of paint that you squeezed out 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.600
 tube and paint will need less and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.940
 shades will be more likely as a result 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.070
 another tip concerns brushes i 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.350
 I recommend having as many brushes as possible. 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.760
 in order to work with all of them and 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.060
 use a clean brush each time and 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.580
 for each color pick your brush 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.060
 that is, for warm shades you will have 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.570
 1 key for cold another for light 3 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.750
 if you write and dark colors and 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.670
 separated by one brush then you have 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.030
 the result may be turbidity 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.910
 colors so when i work i keep in 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.160
 arm several hands 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.470
 this kind of flattery and every time they get that 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.350
 which i need i hope my 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.170
 tips on working in the open air helped you 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.140
 and your work before you become more 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.660
 bright juicy picturesque if you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.470
 there are difficulties in mixing shades then 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.550
 I recommend to take a course in color types have 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.980
 I have a wonderful course 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.720
 flower studies in painting 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.950
 this knowledge will help you feel 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.290
 more confident and mixing 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.720
 window and in the selection of exactly those shades 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.720
 who do you need successes you
