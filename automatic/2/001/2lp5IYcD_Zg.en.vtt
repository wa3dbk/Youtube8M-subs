00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.890
 hello welcome again my kitchen miami 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 Today I have a Puerto Rican recipe 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.590
 What they give me gave me anime a lot 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.720
 Guarín is compared 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.610
 and for those who are not Puerto Rican 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.760
 let me give you a little explanation of 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.070
 that is a juanín and an anime so that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.920
 have a point of reference is something 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.130
 similar to a tamal the only thing is that it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 It makes elongated shape almost like a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.800
 croquette and inside the ingredients are 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.250
 a little different besides that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.650
 we also make it sweet because it's 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.370
 food we serve it typically 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.530
 with the palate and salty that's why 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.450
 this combination of guánica with cod 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.090
 It's so popular in Puerto Rico and so 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.550
 delicious for cod recipes 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.760
 deliver right here to my channel and we're going 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 to find under baptized and now we go 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 to see how it is done in blocks 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 and the ingredients are 2 cups of milk 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:15.900
 of coconut 2 cups of corn flour 34 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.360
 cups of some broth that you like to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 you can be chicken broth can be 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 broth of meat broth of ham there is no 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 pulling out is just three quarts cup 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 of water 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.130
 I prefer to know when because it gives 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.200
 more flavor to the wali nor a fourth cup of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 brown sugar and half a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.780
 with the pan the care because if so 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.600
 only broth and the charge is salty not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.840
 is going to need salt so with the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.570
 pan have been careful and to wrap the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.450
 marlins are going to need a banana leaf 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.810
 is I have them cut more or less 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.030
 in a measure of 6 x 8 that's why it depends 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 also the size you want 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.520
 do the anime just like you can do 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.359
 large or smaller according to your 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.459
 taste 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.560
 If you do not get or do not have a sheet 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.080
 banana you live can also be 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.540
 buy and sell them in the super 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.910
 market as you can see packaged and what 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.209
 today is to do is cut too 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.500
 they are going to need a few pieces of cord 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.760
 to tie it by the board 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:34.550
 now I'm going to heat the coconut milk the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.760
 broth and sugar brown until almost 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.460
 that is about to boil I'm going to 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.490
 try and that's where I'm going to decide if 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.160
 I'm going to take salt or not because according to 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.860
 know this liquid as they will know what 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.870
 anime 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.650
 when it looks like it's going to boil 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.490
 they put out the fire and there they go quickly 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:02.350
 throwing flour and move until 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.500
 all mix well and this has us 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 cook completely remember that this 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.140
 nothing more than to mix it and overtake 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.420
 the process of the gua nor me because 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.390
 this really ends up cooking in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 the rubber now I'm going to change for the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.450
 palette to mix well all 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.220
 Remember I told them that the Marines 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.230
 you can make it the size that you 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.140
 want me I like about the big ones 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.960
 so I'm using a ciborium 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.780
 serve ice cream so this is my 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.569
 measure then the only thing that one has 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.209
 what to do is 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.019
 give it a little bit of shape not much because 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.010
 the shape is then given in the mouth 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.050
 they get 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.460
 on the sheet 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.600
 backward 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.600
 yes talk about 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.480
 and they wrap themselves like candy 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.319
 it is going around 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.720
 he turns around and they tie themselves in 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.299
 the tips naturally if they have a 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.920
 assistant is much easier because it is 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.010
 a person who puts his finger in there 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.709
 while one is doing the mooring and 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.079
 I'm working alone so I'm 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.510
 spending a little bit more work but 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.630
 well this is the idea they look good 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.110
 tight and well to margarito in the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.110
 tips 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.560
 then cut off the excess they can 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560
 have a cord 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.720
 the marine is already ready to put them 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.460
 boil to cook 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.640
 here they already have same anime already 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.940
 finished that mixture and this size 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.370
 of good and I get between 10 and 12 one and 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.050
 which I know you do nothing in 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.350
 a smaller measure that will come out 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.280
 much more now this must be put to 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.820
 boil in very hot water with salt 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.590
 around about 15 minutes when 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.780
 I'm on the loose banana leaf that 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.240
 So delicious taste that has the banana 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.610
 and it makes an exquisite combination between 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:28.039
 the banana flavor and the corn flavor 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.250
 today here as I told you before, water with 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.039
 They put salt and boil for cooking 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.500
 about 15 minutes and then ready to 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.260
 eat 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.810
 and after the video they are served as well as 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.320
 it is also from you with the cod 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.390
 it is putting bits of manning or a 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.930
 little bit of sweet cod with 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.690
 salty 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.100
 this is an exquisite meal 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.410
 Puerto Rican they know that you 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.320

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.360
 but that you like it do it soon and I 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.270
