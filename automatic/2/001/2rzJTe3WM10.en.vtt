 choose a side right 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:39.450

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 I do not want to continue 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.030

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.870

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.700
 because it's been a while since I have not 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.140
 game the lech agent has a lot more curves 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.540
 than before before it did not have as much 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.840
 this curve was not so narrow as that. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.890
 some scenarios to 30 11 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:03.540

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.340
