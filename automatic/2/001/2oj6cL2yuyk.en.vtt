00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
that's just one of those maps that
really<00:00:49.559> doesn't<00:00:49.980> seem<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.340> suit<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.760> playstyle

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

don't really live stream very very often

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.960 
don't really live stream very very often
or<00:01:06.869> even<00:01:06.960> often<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.860> matter<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:08.640> on

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
or even often for that matter or even on

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
a consistent basis for that matter but a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410 
a consistent basis for that matter but a
few<00:01:11.189> live<00:01:11.400> stream<00:01:11.700> every<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
few live stream every now and then I

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.820 
few live stream every now and then I
think<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.720> last<00:01:12.990> week<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.380> live

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
think that last week actually live

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
think that last week actually live
streamed<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.850> braids<00:01:15.150> or

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
streamed a little bit of two braids or

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.999 
streamed a little bit of two braids or
single-player<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.020> after<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
single-player and after that a little

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
single-player and after that a little
bit<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> rate<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.790> multiplayer<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.780> not

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
bit of to rate or multiplayer I do not

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.190 
bit of to rate or multiplayer I do not
really<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.250> called<00:01:20.549> duty<00:01:20.880> ever

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
really like them called duty ever

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.420

every<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.340> then<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> mainly<00:02:35.210> just

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
every now and then but it mainly just

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.690 
every now and then but it mainly just
use<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.810> because<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.320> gets<00:02:36.530> me<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:37.010> ton<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> score

nothing<00:04:30.570> recruit<00:04:30.930> busts<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.350> course<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:31.860> the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
nothing recruit busts of course but the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.800 
nothing recruit busts of course but the

hard boss the hardened bus is it
hardened<00:04:34.170> or<00:04:34.320> harf<00:04:34.590> actually<00:04:35.580> don't<00:04:35.820> know

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
hardened or harf actually don't know

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.160 
hardened or harf actually don't know
where<00:04:36.060> it's<00:04:36.210> hard<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.480> know<00:04:36.570> how<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.750> think<00:04:36.900> it's

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
where it's hard to know how I think it's

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.900 
where it's hard to know how I think it's
hard<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:38.040> it<00:04:38.130> could<00:04:38.250> be<00:04:38.370> hard<00:04:38.640> or<00:04:38.760> even

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
hard but it could be hard or even

veteran<00:04:39.390> for<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.630> matter<00:04:39.750> but<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.020> probably

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
veteran for that matter but you probably

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.960 
veteran for that matter but you probably
have<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.710> lose<00:04:40.950> against<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.400> veteran<00:04:41.790> bucks

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
have to lose against the veteran bucks

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.550 
have to lose against the veteran bucks
because<00:04:42.180> they<00:04:42.660> are<00:04:42.780> literally<00:04:43.050> pretty<00:04:43.410> good

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
because they are literally pretty good

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.500 
because they are literally pretty good
