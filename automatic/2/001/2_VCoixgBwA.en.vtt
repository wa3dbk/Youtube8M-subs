million<00:01:00.800> but<00:01:01.129> when<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.339> inquire<00:01:01.640> about<00:01:01.760> them

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
million but when you inquire about them

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.180 
million but when you inquire about them
they're<00:01:02.390> gonna<00:01:02.510> say<00:01:02.750> about<00:01:02.960> 8<00:01:03.260> million<00:01:03.649> so<00:01:04.160> I

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
they're gonna say about 8 million so I

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.160 
they're gonna say about 8 million so I
would<00:01:04.580> say<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:04.789> can<00:01:05.000> pick<00:01:05.149> them<00:01:05.239> up<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:05.449> right

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
would say you can pick them up for right

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.719 
would say you can pick them up for right
around<00:01:06.289> 5<00:01:06.649> million<00:01:06.950> somewhere<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.580> in
