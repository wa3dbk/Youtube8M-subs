00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 i am in everything hello world of today's video i 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.910
 I dedicate to all people who want 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.929
 jump higher but still can not do 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.269
 This is shorter than the most beginners not often in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 lichku write the same questions exactly 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.619
 these questions I want to answer right now 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 help if jumping rope lift 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 jump rope came to help you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.480
 warm up well before training 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 increase your stamina but to the height 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.539
 jump they will not greatly affect how high 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 jump out to score on top 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.780
 jumps out need for example she brush 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.730
 if you keep well drink otherwise 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.980
 a little bit less if it holds the ball poorly 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 slightly more somehow increased its 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.010
 jump and tell about your training 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 I tried a lot of things for the program 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 started the simplest bale programs 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.590
 Cast smog balls at the moment 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 constantly asking and about 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.329
 tell your program you will understand that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 one message does not tell all 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 right away it's very volumetric 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.589
 at the moment I am combining workouts 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
 mechanical playpen 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.390
 nek- exercises with weightlifting 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.240
 and naturally without anywhere 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.189
 edition of the deadlines how do you think how 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 anticipation leads to a better jump 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.520
 It seems to me all the time that this question 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 ask the most lazy who want one 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.659
 exercise do nothing else 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.790
 sniff know you have to do very 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.829
 many things not of one 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.150
 exercises 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.970
 let a single bit of exercise without 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.140
 which do not cost my workout this 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 squat romanian take taking on 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.600
 chest fisherman well and in athletics 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.659
 manege this barrier and came with depth 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.110
 sprint and we really are still very 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 a lot of things but it is as a base as possible 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.479
 quick add jump quick add 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.119
 jump east get if you 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.009
 fantastically not distant 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.360
 in order to achieve some 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.060
 more or less change the results for you 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.399
 it will take several years but it is not 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.340
 It means that you need to get upset and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.129
 don't start doing it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.510
 because your process will also be 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.400
 constantly increase and you will 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.190
 like this you will want 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.769
 achieve some new heights of new 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.090
 results 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.890
 so you need to start right now not 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.280
 lose time what programs came 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.530
 can you advise me to begin with 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.560
 I will say that I do not advise doing 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.569
 none of you are programs like air 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.230
 alert and we bounds and programs that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.579
 promise 30 40 50 70 centimeters. for two 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.930
 of the month it's all not working it's all rubbish 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.209
 what can I advise so otobyu 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.790
 vertical jump it really 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.799
 worthwhile stuff probably not sure 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.700
 exactly the best thing on the internet for 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.819
 beginners 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.590
 written in simple language you will understand what 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.260
 such a jump there is a lot 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.829
 programs like with weight with burdening like 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.959
 without so that that is necessary for all beginners 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:09.049
 this is not advertising not change not pay 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:12.010
 so I really advise 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.480
 Windows is a vertical jump remember 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.829
 how many years can you start to squat 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.239
 did not affect growth 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.100
 Are there any problems with knees squats I 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 I think that you can begin to retake 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.859
 14-15 but starting naturally with a coach 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.750
 because you all need to put 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.430
 technique and long work on technique 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.299
 squats so that later there were no problems 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.700
 so that the bow of you is not injured 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.500
 adds levitan ross to growth 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 squats will not affect because growth 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.549
 laid genetically and only some 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.959
 extreme weights can somehow affect 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.160
 there will be no problems with your knees if 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.840
 will be the right technique 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 with the right technique your knees too 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.970
 will strengthen that will help you avoid injury 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.290
 to further how many centimeters jump 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.910
 I can add a month and a year to the week 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.280
 on top no one can ever 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.769
 this question because it all depends on 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.500
 your self out of your workouts 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.419
 from your genetics do and maximum you 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.010
 get the maximum that's all 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.100
 how many times a week do you need to train 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.440
 all this is purely individual because 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.260
 it all depends on many factors if 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460
 you are masked ballroom season then you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.139
 can't afford much 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.360
 workouts a week for another jump 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.699
 if you have the off season about it at all 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.400
 I recommend a different situation for beginners 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.800
 two such workouts per week notes 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840
 put on the sensations is it possible with 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.070
 height 175 cm to develop from above 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.560
 yes you can and any of you who have two 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.330
 legs are capable of it so everything depends 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.669
 just from you and from your desire 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.030
 which does squats take on 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.139
 chest 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.729
 jumps into the water and scientifically drops aprica 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.760
 you can enter it all right now 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.440
 boogie and get comprehensive answers 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.280
 became the first line now be mine 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.400
 favorite question i am 13 years old jump 55 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.560
 centimeters it's ok it's ok 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.930
 and finally, I want to tell you all 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.240
 carry easy ways don't expect that 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.010
 the result will come quickly do not believe everyone 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.460
 these programs that promise manditz and 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.620
 jump meters in a matter of months you 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.599
 just take your time to 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.210
 to achieve some results you 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.800
 it will take years of hard training but 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.430
 if you are ready for this you have everything 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.430
