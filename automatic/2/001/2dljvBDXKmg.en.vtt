 orchestra 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360
 while this regional canes and then 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 replacements in in the orchestras 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.530
 now since I decided to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.190
 devote entirely to the career of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.190
 concert 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.230
 repertoire is what music then 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.340

 haydn email and then after my link the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.580
 hollow but the repertoire rather 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.580
 romantic and 20th the interests 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.650
