tanabe<00:01:07.950> coilovers<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.210> brand<00:01:10.479> new<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.740> they

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
tanabe coilovers but brand new and they

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.010 
tanabe coilovers but brand new and they
are<00:01:12.430> they<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.759> a<00:01:12.820> 40<00:01:13.119> way<00:01:13.240> adjustment<00:01:13.840> I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
are they have a 40 way adjustment I

are they have a 40 way adjustment I
think<00:01:14.799> we<00:01:14.920> can<00:01:15.070> lower<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.030> car<00:01:16.210> almost<00:01:16.570> 2

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
think we can lower the car almost 2

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.569 
think we can lower the car almost 2
inches<00:01:16.990> on<00:01:17.439> those<00:01:17.619> if<00:01:17.799> we<00:01:17.920> wanted<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.220> it's

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
inches on those if we wanted to it's

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.389 
inches on those if we wanted to it's
probably<00:01:18.700> about<00:01:18.939> right<00:01:19.119> there<00:01:20.219> sit<00:01:21.219> right<00:01:21.369> on

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
probably about right there sit right on

system with titanium tips and they had a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.260 
system with titanium tips and they had a
prototype<00:01:56.450> made<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.870> their<00:01:57.020> project<00:01:57.470> FRS<00:01:58.270> that

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
prototype made to their project FRS that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
prototype made to their project FRS that
they<00:01:59.630> did<00:01:59.810> not<00:01:59.840> send<00:02:00.560> into<00:02:00.830> production

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
they did not send into production

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.790 
they did not send into production
because<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.790> was<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.240> cost<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.800> producing

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
because it was the cost of producing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.130 
because it was the cost of producing
that<00:02:04.010> was<00:02:04.130> way<00:02:04.280> too<00:02:04.310> high<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.810> they<00:02:05.930> said<00:02:06.080> they

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that was way too high but they said they

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.999 
that was way too high but they said they
do<00:02:06.530> plan<00:02:06.710> on<00:02:06.770> releasing<00:02:07.430> one<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.679> plan

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
stoptech high-performance pads and the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.729 
stoptech high-performance pads and the
standards<00:02:35.780> will<00:02:35.900> break<00:02:36.050> under<00:02:36.260> four<00:02:36.500> front

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.830 
and rear sand with the pads and the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
rotors so I think that's definitely

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.290 
rotors so I think that's definitely
going<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.110> be<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.410> good<00:02:42.620> start<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
going to be a really good start on the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.130 
going to be a really good start on the
