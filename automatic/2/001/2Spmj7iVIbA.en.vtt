00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.870
 Put out a lot 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.720
 It is a wicked way 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.240
 There was a top but dad 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.240
 It is a poor co-ordination after all 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.860
 Another big pattern should be 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.740
 It 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.570
 Well then how about if you put this out 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.570
 Just change the balance between the top and bottom 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.579
 The other 28 government is listening to emergency couple of home Tsu 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.710
 This is great, isn't it 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.010
 Already 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.850
 Most probably is that item 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.070
 If you can't use everything 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.790
 Though 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.270
 Above is the month 8 days you were this one 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.770
 It seems like it could be one piece and how many 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 A great pattern is already 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 I can guide you 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.650
 Thanks to 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.640
 And wards 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:31.790
 I thought the cornerstone as earphone 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:35.510
 I'm going down from the second floor in the Togomi- do , and I'll call it a really good school 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.340
 It's a residence, and if it's good to encourage others, do you already have space? 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.719
 Mart south store 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.909
 But I ca n't throw away I ca n't throw away thinking that I want to come someday 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.510
 I'm not alone 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.470
 That 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.560
 The following are all listed 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.820
 Multiplying the makes and winter 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 That's great for me too 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.189
 Ask them doing 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.970
 Or with or put color 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.970
 Oh if 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.890
 Suddenly all 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.710
 I was already surprised and I wanted from the top 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.340
 Well, enjoy from tomorrow well again 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.340
 Birthday from the sky
