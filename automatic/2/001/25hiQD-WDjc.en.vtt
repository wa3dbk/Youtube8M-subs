00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 great unknown for it does not have 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.729
 help of an aptitude test which is a 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.470
 test that helps people determine 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.610
 which faction most matches your 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 personality 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.240
 but offered help becomes a 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.590
 source of torment 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.899
 when the test determines that the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.390
 results were inconclusive indicating that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.600
 more than one faction and this way 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 identifying it as a divergent 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 now that this means what is the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.740
 choose her and everything else just goes to know it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.360
 in the booklet being very sincere I just 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.009
 I began to see people because several 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 you left comments asking for 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.000
 please make divergent present and why 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.770
 this book has been selected several times 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.190
 in social media in recent times 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.160
 so I got it 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.110
 The premise and I was thinking about it 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 contains elements that are similar to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.640
 snakes 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.890
 in the divergent real its core is a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.030
 battle between harry potter and his four 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.710
 homes and a hat selector 39 had nine 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.350
 clues and the five family plans 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.030
 cahill with its unique features 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 voracious games for being a future 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.410
 dystopian and furthermore the form of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200
 writing and the main characters are 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.940
 very similar and even twilight 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.720
 if you take into account my novel 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.370
 side 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.380
 despite wanting to take advantage of this 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.520
 success if the final result a work 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.800
 singular with reading quite 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.750
 Pleasure both by the scenarios very well 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.310
 constructed by the author and in the cells 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.800
 of detention where revelations are 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.420
 actions carried out took place at the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.130
 veronica about media very well the time 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.170
 that things happen in the book 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.050
 making it very intuitive and fast law is 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.090
 so fast that it follows today in one day the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.010
 my biggest problem with the book was the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.510
 predictability of relations 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.700
 I was not very shocked at all. 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.560
 special moment the author of several 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
 during the narrative that makes the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 unfolding of the facts is quite obvious and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.340
 I'm the kind of person who likes to 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.190
 talk beyond the cute and the respective fall 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.800
 so that displeased him no more 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.080
 I found the novel of the rival very forced 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.360
 much my side I prefer a relationship of 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.650
 romance more kind than that 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.630

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.489

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.880
 same from the American edition 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.080
 in general to complain but in reality the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.450
 china that tends to pay more attention 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.970
 in the edition of which I all points
