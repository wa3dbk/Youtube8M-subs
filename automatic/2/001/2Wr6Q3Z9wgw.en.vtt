00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.340
 ah 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.340
 i 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.280
 ah 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770
 Y 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 Y 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.160
 here 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 Y 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 Y 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 here 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 ah 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 yes 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 jam 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.910
 nothing else 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.280
 after trying them we can say that 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.950
 we loved the rings to be able 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.190
 regulate the zoom focus and the diaphragm 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.020
 they are very soft, especially the zoom and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.150
 the diaphragm that for example with the 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.120
 zoom in video will be very good to do 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.740
 approaches and distances and also 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.900
 the diaphragm that will allow us to go 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.030
 regulating the light as we move 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.100
 the plane without jumping without being 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.410
 note but in a very fluid way the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.270
 sharpness is very high and the contrast very 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.550
 gentle that will help us get the 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.709
 cinematographic look that we like so much 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.330
 although they do not have contacts that does not 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.550
 it will be a problem because we can 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.830
 guide by the marks of the barrel are 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.410
 your angular ones and that allow us to do 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.420
 framings of general planes but the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.040
 minimum distance of focus is very 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 small and that will also allow us 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.050
 make detailed plans regarding the 11 16 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.850
 millimeters you will not have any problem 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.540
 to record camera in hand but with the 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.519
 16 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.799
 and 8 millimeters we recommend you use 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.109
 a tripod to get shots with more 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.459
 stability in addition to the tests that you 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.200
 we have taught also we have 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.570
 used to record the blog of the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.169
 next week so you can see more 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.169
 results
