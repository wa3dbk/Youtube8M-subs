display<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> dual<00:00:16.920> core<00:00:17.130> processor

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
display you get a dual core processor

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.630

lot of value for the money but let's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.830

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it is a low quality display meaning it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
it is a low quality display meaning it
has<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.510> poor<00:01:09.900> viewing<00:01:10.200> angles<00:01:10.560> washed<00:01:11.340> out
