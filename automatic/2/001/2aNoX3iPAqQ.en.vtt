 tankers last days take 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.290
 additional measures to protect them 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.140
 they began to weld on extra

 lattices on the tower strengthen them also

 besides these homemade extras

 from the sides of the tank right over the dynamic 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.809
 protection sheets are welded on 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.740
 which are amplified by various 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.420
 materials increase layers of protection 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.390
 definitely should help security 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 crews when hit crews use 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.830
 all sorts of improvised means in order 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:39.180
 to in these difficult conditions
