problems are pretty tough to diagnose
and<00:00:20.679> fix<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:22.029> if<00:00:22.390> you've<00:00:22.630> got<00:00:22.779> a<00:00:22.810> basic

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
and fix but if you've got a basic

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.749 
and fix but if you've got a basic
understanding<00:00:23.259> of<00:00:23.769> motorcycle<00:00:24.310> mechanics

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.720 

and<00:01:42.660> over<00:01:43.050> here<00:01:43.230> we<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.680> what's<00:01:44.190> called<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
and over here we have what's called a

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.730 
and over here we have what's called a
field<00:01:45.120> excited<00:01:45.660> unit<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.390> again<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
field excited unit so again here is this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.330 
field excited unit so again here is this
data<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.480> one<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.780> rope<00:01:52.070> again<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
data and this one is the rope again the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
data and this one is the rope again the
rotor<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> attached<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> crankshaft<00:01:54.870> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
rotor is attached to the crankshaft it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.040 
rotor is attached to the crankshaft it
spins<00:01:55.560> inside<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.460> data<00:01:56.900> there<00:01:57.900> is<00:01:57.930> no

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
spins inside this data there is no

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.600 
spins inside this data there is no
permanent<00:01:58.740> magnet<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.550> an

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
permanent magnet on this it's an

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
permanent magnet on this it's an
electromagnet<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.480> rode<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
electromagnet the rode up and it's the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.780 
electromagnet the rode up and it's the
biggest<00:02:01.890> difference<00:02:02.990> obviously<00:02:04.790> your

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
biggest difference obviously your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
biggest difference obviously your
components<00:02:06.450> might<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> look<00:02:06.990> exactly<00:02:07.470> like

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
components might not look exactly like

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219 
components might not look exactly like
this<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:08.540> this<00:02:09.540> should<00:02:09.750> give<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:09.990> rough

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
this but this should give you a rough

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
this but this should give you a rough
idea<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.310> got

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
idea on what you got

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.530

one trigger okay here we have a couple
of<00:03:16.230> rectifier<00:03:16.980> regulators<00:03:17.780> what<00:03:18.780> these<00:03:18.959> do<00:03:19.110> is

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
of rectifier regulators what these do is

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.600 
of rectifier regulators what these do is
they<00:03:19.260> take<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.709> current<00:03:19.980> coming<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.520> this

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
they take the current coming out of this

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.229 
they take the current coming out of this
data<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.330> AC<00:03:21.540> volts<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.880> they<00:03:23.880> convert

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
data which is AC volts and they convert

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.840 
data which is AC volts and they convert
it<00:03:24.390> over<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.780> DC<00:03:25.410> volts<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:26.100> charge<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.700> battery

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
it over to DC volts to charge a battery

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.890 
it over to DC volts to charge a battery
or<00:03:27.390> on<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.690> lighting<00:03:28.230> systems<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.750> see

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
or on the lighting systems you can see

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.330 
or on the lighting systems you can see
these<00:03:31.019> two<00:03:31.260> models<00:03:31.709> right<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.100> cooling

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
these two models right here have cooling

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.690 
these two models right here have cooling
fins<00:03:32.610> on<00:03:32.850> them<00:03:33.030> some<00:03:33.780> models<00:03:34.140> don't

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
fins on them some models don't

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
fins on them some models don't
these<00:03:35.700> two<00:03:35.910> have<00:03:36.090> harnesses<00:03:36.780> coming<00:03:37.080> on

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
these two have harnesses coming on

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.759 
these two have harnesses coming on
instead<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.830> plugs<00:03:38.100> directly<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> unit<00:03:39.769> so

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
instead of plugs directly on the unit so

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.500 
instead of plugs directly on the unit so
like<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.610> said<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.850> also<00:03:42.030> may<00:03:42.209> not<00:03:42.360> look

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
like I said you also may not look

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.750 
like I said you also may not look
exactly<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:43.050> these<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.550> should<00:03:44.730> be

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
exactly like these but it should be

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.229 
exactly like these but it should be
something<00:03:45.000> similar<00:03:46.850> all<00:03:47.850> right<00:03:47.970> what<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.209> have

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
something similar all right what we have

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.260 
something similar all right what we have
here<00:03:48.540> are<00:03:48.810> CDI<00:03:49.590> box<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.820> ignition<00:03:51.269> coils
