00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.019
 tried a few words from the ways 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.410
 how to glue the film of 10 ways 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:12.410
 somewhere only one came up 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.410
 showing off 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:44.110
 do not immediately turn off so it means that we 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.540
 see sticks even deep wherever 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.260
 the roller passed there and it can also be glued 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.180
 repair the hole that is here 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.129
 a little bit 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 no unstuck but she keeps 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.629
 firmly that is top just put 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.050
 film and warming she stuck herself 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.879
 here so I came to check out your finger 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.460
 what kind of thing did you need to do here 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.220
 ugly here that is she repair 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 suitable we cover the same way it 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.890
 here she is in a tree as if she is stroking 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.479
 here too it clings 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 film glues well not only is she 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.180
 has shrink properties 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.560
 when we have had concave come on 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 now check it warm up 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.770
 now she is cool and boss 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.220
 that is, when I nailed and and here 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:03.320
 stapler she hung heavily warmed it 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.320
 it all started
