00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 today we will learn how to do it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.500
 to cut good beef 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 the beef has already seen the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 characteristics of her 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 we always try to fine red 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 fat has to have a certain thickness 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 she tries an adequate quality 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
 After we're bought, we'll start 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 prepare her for that traditional 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 steak we make at home 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.230
 So if you arrive in a supermarket and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.090
 is a piece of meat and does not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 the little bit where we'll learn from 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.750
 What do we do to make steak and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 other preparations that you can 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.879
 use in your home the first thing to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 We always use a knife from a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.590
 reasonable size this knife can not be 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 Too small starts here that we 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 will not be able to cut can not be 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 that saw blade that normally 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 people use to eat at home they have to be 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.649
 one suitable knife in the knife over here are 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.550
 first thing is to clean this meat of the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.550
 fats she has 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.050
 very well 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.630
 now the house is clean we already 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.000
 Can you see the difference the load had 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 before and the meat that we have now is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 logic that reduced the size of the meat 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 enough does not mean it's all 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.860
 load we took people off 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 to lose soon I'll teach you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 what can we do with it here? 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.150
 But from here I'm going to take some cuts. 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.190
 standard within the gastronomy I want 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.660
 teach you how to call these 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.570
 cuts and how we will be able to use 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.369
 they in the day to day inside the kitchen 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 if we take this load and give it a 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.259
 distance of more or less four fingers 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.190
 here is how it is and I make a cut 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 I have a piece of meat already in the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.020
 very reasonable size 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.800
 this piece around 200 grams calls 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.770
 he has good tour for you 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.390
 can grill it and it gets very bad past it 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 inside normally to the point is a 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.770
 Dude, we can not do it. 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.680
 well past your cut smaller than that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.590
 around two fingers or so 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 this size so I have what the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.980
 people call it a medallion and this medallion 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.810
 will serve 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.019
 I need two of them to be able to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.390
 serve a smaller person than that 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.510
 would be about half of this 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:42.269
 medallion almost a finger and that is a finger 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.959
 It's what we know as escalope 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.420
 The escalope we have in Brazil too. 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.920
 the steak and you're going to say that be is a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.570
 a little thinner than that 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 really the steak that we see the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.620
 staff doing a supermarket a little 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.750
 thinner but this already a steak figure 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.670
 very reasonable for us to be able to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.739
 take a beak then we pull this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.739
 meat a little thinner 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.350
 so we'll take our thing 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.920
 if we are small because our flesh is 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.810
 thin 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.140
 now when I have a bigger load one 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 duck a soft dump it will come out a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.680
 bit bit larger bit 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 another important thing is people 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.420
 recognize the people in which direction they are 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.750
 the fibers of the meat and here we 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.000
 can see the fibers of this meat 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.100
 We're never going to cut her off the table. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.740
 the direction of the fibers we sit as 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.870
 cut against the fibers 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.700
 at the time I went to clean the meat is over 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 left over some pieces that will not 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.320
 in this crux that I was taking the steak 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.110
 and these pieces here by his format 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.910
 I can not do this too but I 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.370
 I can use it to draw 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.140
 this guy is not going outside I shot her a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.530
 strip I call mc mc if you 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.709
 go to a bar in a bar they will call 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.720
 this is bait and in your house 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.420
 you can also call the format brings 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.140
 trombone off is exactly what we 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.670
 let's do it 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.890
 in another video with this meat is 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.390
 left over, I'm going to finish now 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.220
 clean this face so we can see the 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:27.090
 result that we have to go it 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:28.950
 cleans it later while it yields or 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.720
 We are already cutting you soon the enem 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.979
 Do not even stop working. 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.840
 our little bitch escalope the medallion and 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.700
 the turn 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.190
 now just get these high loads 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.810
 for a grill another a frying pan that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.370
 You will have your houses ready for 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.979
 eating but this subject for a 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.050
 video because that's how you do it 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.050
 cut the beef
