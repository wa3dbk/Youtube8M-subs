00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
something that I've always found very

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
something that I've always found very
fun<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.640> sit<00:00:26.880> around<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.240> friends<00:00:27.510> who

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that this year we're going to see mobile

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.509 
that this year we're going to see mobile
games<00:00:50.760> being<00:00:51.000> marketed<00:00:51.330> as<00:00:51.540> more<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
games being marketed as more of a

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.460 
games being marketed as more of a
hardcore<00:00:53.519> form<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.570> gaming<00:00:55.019> for<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.260> first

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
hardcore form of gaming for the first

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.109 
hardcore form of gaming for the first
time<00:00:55.710> ever<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.369> think<00:00:56.549> we're<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.970> see<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
time ever I think we're going to see a

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.680 
time ever I think we're going to see a
lot<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.390> real<00:00:58.350> games<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:59.129> games<00:00:59.369> with<00:01:00.089> a<00:01:00.299> much

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
lot more real games or games with a much

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.009 
lot more real games or games with a much
more<00:01:00.900> real<00:01:01.559> game<00:01:01.949> style<00:01:02.460> being<00:01:03.330> ported<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
more real game style being ported to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
more real game style being ported to
tablets<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> phones<00:01:05.100> things<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
tablets and phones things like that and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.850 
tablets and phones things like that and
I<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.110> we're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I also think we're going to see a lot of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
I also think we're going to see a lot of
technology<00:01:08.580> that's<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.119> focused<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
technology that's going to be focused on

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.500 
technology that's going to be focused on
maintaining<00:01:10.410> quality<00:01:11.010> while<00:01:11.820> increasing<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
maintaining quality while increasing the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.100 
maintaining quality while increasing the
mobility<00:01:13.280> prediction<00:01:14.280> number<00:01:14.850> two<00:01:15.360> now<00:01:16.050> we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
mobility prediction number two now we

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
mobility prediction number two now we
know<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.560> Microsoft<00:01:17.310> has<00:01:17.490> quite<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
know that Microsoft has quite a bit of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.970 
know that Microsoft has quite a bit of
backtracking<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.410> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> it's

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
backtracking to do and I think that it's

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.610 
backtracking to do and I think that it's
definitely<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.730> happen<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.150> e3

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
definitely going to happen at e3

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.620 
definitely going to happen at e3
especially<00:01:22.620> in<00:01:22.800> terms<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.250> DRM<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.300> games

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
especially in terms of DRM and use games

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.560 
especially in terms of DRM and use games
now<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:26.850> almost<00:01:27.150> sure

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
now the other thing that I'm almost sure

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
now the other thing that I'm almost sure
is<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> happen<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> community<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
is going to happen in the community is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.460 
is going to happen in the community is
we're<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.690> this<00:01:30.930> increased

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
we're going to see this increased

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.060 
we're going to see this increased
optimism<00:01:32.190> about<00:01:32.520> Sony<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.480> ps4<00:01:34.070> purely

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
optimism about Sony and the ps4 purely

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
optimism about Sony and the ps4 purely
because<00:01:35.280> while<00:01:36.270> Microsoft<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.050> busy

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
because while Microsoft is busy

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.910 
because while Microsoft is busy
backtracking<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.470> fixing<00:01:40.470> things<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
backtracking and fixing things that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
backtracking and fixing things that
they've<00:01:41.070> said<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> past<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.480> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
they've said in the past we're going to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.260 
they've said in the past we're going to
see<00:01:42.750> Sony<00:01:43.050> stay<00:01:43.380> completely<00:01:43.890> silent<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
see Sony stay completely silent and it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.660 
see Sony stay completely silent and it
will<00:01:45.390> be<00:01:45.510> considered<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.500> sort<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.370> won

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
will be considered that they sort of won

this argument without doing anything

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.140 
this argument without doing anything

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
even though in reality they're just

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.170 
even though in reality they're just
being<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:51.810> shady<00:01:52.290> about<00:01:52.710> what<00:01:53.180> their

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
focusing more on one of their original

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
if one of those shows over the price and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.800 
if one of those shows over the price and
the<00:03:12.370> other<00:03:12.579> one<00:03:12.730> doesn't<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.540> one<00:03:13.660> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the other one doesn't then the one that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.150 
the other one doesn't then the one that
doesn't<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.650> one<00:03:14.769> that's<00:03:14.829> gonna<00:03:14.950> look

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
doesn't is the one that's gonna look

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.009 
doesn't is the one that's gonna look
like<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.459> little<00:03:15.790> bit<00:03:15.880> weird<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.480> shady<00:03:16.690> right

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
like a little bit weird and shady right

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.890 
like a little bit weird and shady right
I<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:17.950> both<00:03:18.190> are<00:03:18.400> going<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.700> show<00:03:18.910> up<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
I think both are going to show up with a

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.069 
I think both are going to show up with a
base<00:03:20.230> price<00:03:20.579> now<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.880> also<00:03:22.209> think<00:03:22.750> that

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
base price now I also think that

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.039 
base price now I also think that
Nintendo<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.400> going<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.209> use<00:03:25.510> this

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
Nintendo is going to use this

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.860 
Nintendo is going to use this

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.210 
that is this game just got canned and
maybe<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.840> did<00:03:56.019> maybe<00:03:56.500> that's<00:03:56.799> what<00:03:57.010> they're

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
maybe it did maybe that's what they're

you<00:03:59.319> know<00:03:59.410> what<00:03:59.590> we're<00:03:59.739> just<00:03:59.890> not<00:03:59.980> making<00:04:00.130> this

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
you know what we're just not making this

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.509 
you know what we're just not making this
game<00:04:00.579> but<00:04:01.150> if<00:04:01.540> they<00:04:02.440> were<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.709> tell<00:04:03.069> us<00:04:03.310> a

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
I think they'd win it guys and obviously

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.430 
I think they'd win it guys and obviously
by<00:04:10.610> win<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:11.240> mean<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.480> more<00:04:12.080> people

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
by win it I just mean that more people

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.930 
by win it I just mean that more people
in<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.770> community<00:04:13.190> would<00:04:13.310> be<00:04:13.430> talking<00:04:13.850> about

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
in the community would be talking about

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.130 
in the community would be talking about
the<00:04:14.210> games<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.840> were<00:04:15.140> featured<00:04:15.530> at<00:04:15.740> e3<00:04:15.950> so

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
the games that were featured at e3 so

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.540 
the games that were featured at e3 so
honestly<00:04:18.140> i<00:04:18.230> think<00:04:18.260> i<00:04:18.620> think<00:04:18.739> sony<00:04:19.310> has<00:04:19.520> a

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:19.550 
honestly i think i think sony has a

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.140 
honestly i think i think sony has a
really<00:04:19.910> good<00:04:20.000> shot<00:04:20.450> at<00:04:20.750> winning<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.760> think

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
really good shot at winning this I think

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.340 
really good shot at winning this I think
that<00:04:23.300> they<00:04:23.420> have<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.570> really<00:04:23.840> good<00:04:24.050> shot<00:04:24.110> at

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
that they have a really good shot at

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.410 
that they have a really good shot at
being<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.800> ones<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.430> really<00:04:25.640> came<00:04:25.970> forward

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
being the ones that really came forward

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.040 
being the ones that really came forward
as<00:04:26.600> an<00:04:26.870> actual<00:04:27.230> game<00:04:27.590> console<00:04:28.720> Nintendo<00:04:29.720> I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
as an actual game console Nintendo I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.950 
as an actual game console Nintendo I
think<00:04:30.680> because<00:04:30.860> they've<00:04:31.370> already<00:04:31.960> released

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
think because they've already released

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.430 
think because they've already released
the<00:04:33.340> only<00:04:34.340> thing<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.640> they<00:04:34.760> can<00:04:34.820> do<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.630> bring

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the only thing that they can do is bring

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.700 
the only thing that they can do is bring
up<00:04:36.620> new<00:04:36.950> IP<00:04:37.130> which<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.120> totally<00:04:38.600> fine<00:04:38.630> or<00:04:39.080> even

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.010
