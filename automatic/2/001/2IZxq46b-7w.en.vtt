and that's something that be cool i
thought<00:01:40.960> i'd<00:01:41.080> be<00:01:41.200> maybe<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.560> t4x<00:01:42.190> but<00:01:42.820> who<00:01:42.910> knows

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
thought i'd be maybe a t4x but who knows

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.320 
thought i'd be maybe a t4x but who knows
it<00:01:43.330> could<00:01:43.360> switch<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.110> up<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.770> 3300<00:01:45.310> as<00:01:46.180> I

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
it could switch it up so the 3300 as I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.110 
it could switch it up so the 3300 as I
said<00:01:46.540> it's<00:01:46.660> very<00:01:46.930> very<00:01:47.260> very<00:01:47.560> similar<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.370> your

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
said it's very very very similar to your

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.120 
said it's very very very similar to your
3230<00:01:49.930> 124<00:01:50.860> megapixels<00:01:51.520> um<00:01:51.960> yeah<00:01:53.130> that's

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
3230 124 megapixels um yeah that's

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.010 
3230 124 megapixels um yeah that's
that's<00:01:54.430> really<00:01:54.820> about<00:01:54.880> what<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.630> norm<00:01:55.840> is

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that's really about what the the norm is

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's really about what the the norm is
they<00:01:56.500> put<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.800> export<00:01:57.220> speed<00:01:57.700> for<00:01:58.030> processor

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
they put the export speed for processor

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.840 
they put the export speed for processor
which<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.320> great<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.800> this<00:02:00.400> will<00:02:00.580> probably

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
which is great and this will probably

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.490 
which is great and this will probably
perform<00:02:01.240> better<00:02:01.510> in<00:02:01.600> low<00:02:01.840> light<00:02:02.080> but<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.290> lot<00:02:02.470> of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
perform better in low light but a lot of

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.900 
perform better in low light but a lot of
your<00:02:02.650> cameras<00:02:02.950> out<00:02:03.100> there<00:02:03.130> won't<00:02:03.610> be<00:02:03.760> as<00:02:03.880> bad

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
your cameras out there won't be as bad

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.700 
your cameras out there won't be as bad
as<00:02:04.300> you<00:02:04.420> think<00:02:04.690> even<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.680> shoot

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
as you think even if you have to shoot

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.520 
as you think even if you have to shoot
at<00:02:05.980> 1600<00:02:06.850> yeah<00:02:07.060> I've<00:02:07.300> seen<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.570> been<00:02:08.229> hands-on

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
at 1600 yeah I've seen it been hands-on

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.589 
at 1600 yeah I've seen it been hands-on
before<00:02:08.950> I've<00:02:09.039> had<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.220> 30<00:02:09.489> with<00:02:09.640> d<00:02:09.729> 3100<00:02:10.119> before

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
before I've had a 30 with d 3100 before

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.240 
before I've had a 30 with d 3100 before
when<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.780> first<00:02:11.050> started<00:02:11.170> out<00:02:11.440> years<00:02:11.650> ago<00:02:11.800> and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
when I first started out years ago and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.640 
when I first started out years ago and
it<00:02:12.879> didn't<00:02:13.120> look<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.360> greatest<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.750> 1600<00:02:14.470> but

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
it didn't look the greatest at 1600 but

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.930 
it didn't look the greatest at 1600 but
if<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.099> how<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.220> use<00:02:15.340> flash<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.849> good

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
if you know how to use flash and good

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.290 
if you know how to use flash and good
lighting<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:17.140> will<00:02:17.349> be<00:02:17.560> ok<00:02:18.120> another<00:02:19.120> thing

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
lighting you will be ok another thing

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.059 
lighting you will be ok another thing
that<00:02:19.330> they're<00:02:19.599> doing<00:02:19.629> is<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.379> no<00:02:20.560> low-pass

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
that they're doing is the no low-pass

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.910 
that they're doing is the no low-pass
filter<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.599> way<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.110> supposed<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.590> um

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
filter so that way it's supposed to um

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.449 
filter so that way it's supposed to um
you<00:02:24.220> know<00:02:24.550> take<00:02:25.150> add<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:26.590> clarity<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.400> it

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
you know take add more clarity to it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.580 
you know take add more clarity to it
because<00:02:27.700> there's<00:02:27.849> no<00:02:28.060> extra<00:02:28.810> filter<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.290> front

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
because there's no extra filter in front

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.290 
because there's no extra filter in front
of<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.830> sensor<00:02:30.069> or<00:02:30.310> anything<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.819> that's<00:02:31.000> one

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
of the sensor or anything so that's one

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.610 
of the sensor or anything so that's one
of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.480> huge<00:02:31.660> things<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.019> they're<00:02:32.140> pushing

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
of the huge things that they're pushing

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.660 
of the huge things that they're pushing
and<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.459> fact<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.969> that<00:02:33.999> they<00:02:34.599> are<00:02:34.810> putting<00:02:35.290> in

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and the fact is that they are putting in

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.160 
and the fact is that they are putting in
60<00:02:36.670> p<00:02:36.909> for<00:02:37.180> video<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.719> at

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
60 p for video so at

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.949 
60 p for video so at
old<00:02:38.290> 1080p<00:02:38.890> HD<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.209> 60<00:02:40.569> frames<00:02:40.870> per

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
old 1080p HD you can get 60 frames per

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.440 
old 1080p HD you can get 60 frames per
second<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:42.459> basically<00:02:42.700> gives<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:43.090> true

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
second which basically gives you true

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.440 
second which basically gives you true
slow<00:02:43.750> motion<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.380> that's<00:02:44.500> great<00:02:44.860> awesome<00:02:45.459> but

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
slow motion and that's great awesome but

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.150 
slow motion and that's great awesome but
this<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.750> really<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.050> no<00:02:47.290> other<00:02:47.440> nikon<00:02:47.950> line

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
this is really a no other nikon line

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.740 
this is really a no other nikon line
they're<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.790> starting<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.390> put<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
they're just starting to really put that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.210 
they're just starting to really put that
in<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.319> cannons<00:02:50.709> been<00:02:50.860> doing<00:02:51.130> this

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
in now and cannons been doing this

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.680 
in now and cannons been doing this
forever<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:53.520> why<00:02:54.520> in<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.300> don't<00:02:55.540> know

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
forever so why in that I don't know

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.750 
forever so why in that I don't know
maybe<00:02:55.989> they<00:02:56.319> should<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.590> done<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.890> more<00:02:57.640> or

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
maybe they should have done it more or

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.040 
maybe they should have done it more or
less<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.390> know<00:02:58.510> maybe<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> newer

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
less and you know maybe in a newer

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.270 
less and you know maybe in a newer
camera<00:02:59.380> coming<00:02:59.590> up<00:02:59.800> they<00:02:59.950> should<00:03:00.010> throw

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
camera coming up they should throw

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400 
camera coming up they should throw
something<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.730> there<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.060> well<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:02.200> that's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
something in there as well so that's

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.290 
something in there as well so that's
what<00:03:02.709> I'm<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.130> that's<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:03.520> really<00:03:03.790> what<00:03:04.150> is

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
what I'm so that's what really what is

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.800 
what I'm so that's what really what is
new<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:04.840> mean<00:03:04.959> I'm<00:03:05.110> looking<00:03:05.380> here<00:03:05.519> as<00:03:06.519> well

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
new and I mean I'm looking here as well

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.390 
new and I mean I'm looking here as well
and<00:03:07.810> i<00:03:08.019> pretty<00:03:08.170> much<00:03:08.290> covered<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.769> five<00:03:09.130> frames

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
and i pretty much covered it five frames

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.820 
and i pretty much covered it five frames
per<00:03:09.640> second<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.230> isn't<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> sports

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
per second you know this isn't a sports

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.580 
per second you know this isn't a sports
camera<00:03:12.220> or<00:03:12.310> anything<00:03:12.730> i<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:14.200> wouldn't<00:03:14.380> use

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
camera or anything i really wouldn't use

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.110 
camera or anything i really wouldn't use
a<00:03:14.620> lot<00:03:14.830> of<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.040> special<00:03:15.430> effects<00:03:15.670> modes<00:03:15.910> are

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
a lot of the special effects modes are

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.020 
a lot of the special effects modes are
not<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.360> greatest<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:16.989> um<00:03:17.620> yeah<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.790> those

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
not the greatest but um yeah so those

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.520 
not the greatest but um yeah so those
are<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.269> things<00:03:19.390> that's<00:03:19.569> great<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.049> this<00:03:20.350> is
