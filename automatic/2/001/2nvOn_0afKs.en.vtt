00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.290
 I move away from me 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 OK 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.789
 I feel a hurry 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.449
 hello that such a youtube today I bring you a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.579
 new tutorial that he was treated the 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.910
 duct the tutorial to take the 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.870
 star and the magic lighthouse well let's start 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.059
 I've searched in forums on youtube for what 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.809
 serves the lighthouse and the star is really 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.650
 they do not say they do not really say today I'm going to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.050
 teach how is how 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.780
 what use is what it is how 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.730
 get the star and how the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.250
 lighthouse there is also look how it is 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.530
 castell lighthouse and has not left either 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.650
 come out very very few very few videos 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 pages that say how kraft and alfaro are 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.550
 you say they follow us because they do not know 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.190
 can change that can only be 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.610
 Same tivo as the star nothing 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.140
 what to see is the lighthouse can be changed and 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.480
 what is the name of the star can be 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.510
 get and how do you get 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.630
 we removed first that we all need 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 get in the underworld there are about 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.110
 black skeletons 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.370
 once this is black what 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.540
 every very little every many skeletons of 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.540
 that's what it's called 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.580
 gives you the heads you already have a part in 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.990
 its since I have two already defeated the dragon 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.990
 why does this happen? 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.670
 but that watch because sometimes this happens 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.270
 I have returned I have been able to do it very well 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 is regenerating 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.440
 yes or yes you have to put good if you have to 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.300
 be in castle they have to put 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.680
 rock you go and if it did not explode all because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.680
 Break all the blocks in this block 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.540
 how is it called for example 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.450
 his mother 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.450
 all right 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.340
 as you see I have killed him 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.940
 and it gives me the star 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.410
 gives me the star of the underworld 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.950
 let's put 6 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.950
 one 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.550
 without zombies, if they bother me 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 milk 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.720
 As you can see I got the star and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.720
 now as if craft ea 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 the lighthouse is very easy we need 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.239
 obsidian the star and crystal the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.239
 option you can get 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.349
 the option is can be achieved by chopping 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.220
 throwing water on the lava and you can 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.820
 explain with the diamond politician well 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.270
 how the lighthouse is punished is very easy to give 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.270
 the option 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.400
 there 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.910
 the middle star the option there 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.910
 lack 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.860
 in the middle option below as I see 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.650
 we have the lighthouse 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.460
 so that if time can be done 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.470
 pyramids with the lighthouse of son bou bonus 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.770
 that had the game this lighthouse is at 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.770
 split version 1.4 104 was 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.170
 they can be three pyramid towers 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.850
 three and seven times seven 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.000
 99 and 13 for 13 and much more 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.590
 the penalties can be with any 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 block but block of ore by 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 example with gold with iron with diamond 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.080
 and wait for anyone and it's very let's say 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.770
 that doing this is very expensive and for you 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.990
 give very few things is fine always me 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.540
 I would make an iron iron pyramid 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.590
 with six much 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.240
 all right 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.490
 once when they have gone, the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.990
 pyramids have to have unlocked and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.900
 never hollow always and always solid 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.110
 well let's start for example if you 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.230
 they put the 3 for 3 have 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.980
 have these powers for example from the 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.980
 speed and hurried sometimes we need 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.969
 even if late stain for example 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.270
 how do you have to put it or place it 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:19.310
 example who speed 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.440
 in his rival 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.390
 for example they want speed and 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.050
 speed 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.910
 the speed and once they have put and 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.640
 they have to for example pay you with 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.080
 our blocks with him our leader and 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.080
 as you see you move away 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.290
 and they have a veil and they have speed 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.660
 all right 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.170
 now if they want 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.170
 Hurry quickly do the same 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.790
 and in a hurry and as you can see they can bite a lot 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.790
 faster 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.520
 7 x 7 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.520
 you have 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.440
 if you have 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:12.840
 they have here 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.840
 resistance and click give it pay 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.919
 they have resistance 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:23.720
 if they want there is another one that is to jump 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.720
 jump impulse get paid 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.940
 and as you can see, they jump a lot higher 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.180
 I think you can do a whole block 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:42.110
 it's almost all good 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.110
 in the other pyramid 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:50.840
 they already have the strength 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.580
 you give him the choose 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.039
 force 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.039
 pagÃ¡n that has much more force 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.860
 in the effort in the last pyramid 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:12.540
 so I think it also fair 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:17.450
 they already have feedback 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.450
 look no regeneration they give 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.960
 and as you see come three generation 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.960
 but let's say to do this 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.520
 let's say that to do this is you need 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.660
 many minerals a lot of material and I think 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.520
 that it is better to make the positions that 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.440
 I want it to be cheaper, much more 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.690
 economic 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.630
