00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
all right this is the Fellowes laminator

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.690 
all right this is the Fellowes laminator
and<00:00:05.750> there's<00:00:06.750> laminating<00:00:07.470> pouches<00:00:07.799> back<00:00:08.250> here

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
and there's laminating pouches back here

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.549 
and there's laminating pouches back here
that's<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.300> 5<00:00:09.570> mil<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.440> 7<00:00:10.920> 7<00:00:11.730> mil<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.330> I

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
that's a 5 mil it's a 7 7 mil here I

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.829 
that's a 5 mil it's a 7 7 mil here I
like<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.710> put<00:00:13.920> something<00:00:14.160> back<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.570> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
like to put something back here and a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.050 
like to put something back here and a
similar<00:00:16.230> level<00:00:16.470> as<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.830> output<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.820> then

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
similar level as the output because then

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480 
similar level as the output because then
the<00:00:18.410> laminated<00:00:19.410> sheet<00:00:19.650> comes<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the laminated sheet comes out and it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420 
the laminated sheet comes out and it
doesn't<00:00:20.699> curl<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.890> try<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> keep<00:00:23.279> that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
doesn't curl so I just try to keep that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
doesn't curl so I just try to keep that
box<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> laminated<00:00:25.050> sheet

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
box right there so the laminated sheet

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
box right there so the laminated sheet
just<00:00:25.410> falls<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.880> back<00:00:27.150> here

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
just falls right on it and back here

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.860 
just falls right on it and back here
there's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.830> scene<00:00:28.830> where<00:00:28.980> there's<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> power

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.330 

power<00:00:33.870> button

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.300 

then<00:00:39.240> there's<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> software<00:00:40.620> power<00:00:40.920> button

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
then there's a software power button

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.020 
then there's a software power button
that<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> turn<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:44.580> then<00:00:44.880> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that we have to turn on and then the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.590 
that we have to turn on and then the
first<00:00:45.239> thing<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.630> have<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> choose<00:00:46.080> is

first thing that we have to choose is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
first thing that we have to choose is
focus<00:00:48.650> focus<00:00:51.230> then<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.800> better

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
focus focus then we go a little better

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.710 
focus focus then we go a little better
is<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.840> mill<00:00:55.080> now<00:00:55.650> cold<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.030> three<00:00:57.960> mill<00:00:59.720> 510

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720

is the mill now cold or three mill 510
over<00:01:01.470> here<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.920> other<00:01:01.949> side<00:01:02.160> there's

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
over here on the other side there's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.510

flashing and some rollers going and
there's<00:01:18.960> gonna<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> progress<00:01:19.800> bar<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
there's gonna be a progress bar as it

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.590 
there's gonna be a progress bar as it
warms<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.550> this<00:01:23.850> machine<00:01:24.300> so<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
might not take as long to warm up when

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.749 
might not take as long to warm up when
it's<00:01:27.210> done<00:01:27.450> warming<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.950> hand<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.550> gone

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
to make sure that the sealed edge goes

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.330 
to make sure that the sealed edge goes
in<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.050> not<00:02:37.200> want<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.620> edge<00:02:37.920> here

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
in first we do not want this edge here

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.920 
in first we do not want this edge here
that's<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.670> sealed<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.239> go<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.540> first

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that's not sealed to go in first

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.690 
that's not sealed to go in first
just<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:43.069> try<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.130> Center<00:02:44.730> it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
just put this in try to Center it

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.430 
just put this in try to Center it
to<00:02:46.970> push<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> little<00:02:47.780> ways<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.319> then

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
to push it in a little ways and then

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.690 
to push it in a little ways and then
you'll<00:02:48.620> feel<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.069> little<00:02:49.250> bit<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.520> vibration

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
you'll feel a little bit of vibration

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.229 
you'll feel a little bit of vibration
and<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.890> going<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.160> draw<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.790> rest<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
and it's going to draw the rest of the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:05.260 
and it's going to draw the rest of the
way

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.699 

and<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.630> why<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.380> something

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
and this is why I like to have something

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.130 
and this is why I like to have something
at<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.730> other<00:03:08.849> side<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.420> bowed<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:10.020> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
at the other side that's bowed at the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.830 
at the other side that's bowed at the
same<00:03:10.349> height<00:03:10.590> as<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.130> ledge<00:03:11.400> here<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.660> that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
same height as this ledge here so that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.380 
same height as this ledge here so that
when<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.489> lamination<00:03:14.489> comes<00:03:14.790> out<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.180> very

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
when the lamination comes out it's very

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.920 
when the lamination comes out it's very
hot<00:03:15.690> still<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.670> if<00:03:18.300> you<00:03:18.450> don't<00:03:18.599> have<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
hot still and if you don't have a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.860 
hot still and if you don't have a
surface<00:03:19.440> right<00:03:19.650> here<00:03:19.680> then<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> tends<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.489> curl

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
