okay what we were looking out back there
the<00:02:16.460> reason<00:02:16.760> why<00:02:16.850> I'm<00:02:16.940> talking<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.780> was

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
the reason why I'm talking here is was

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.990 
the reason why I'm talking here is was
way<00:02:18.260> too<00:02:18.320> noisy<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.070> close<00:02:19.280> by<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.520> machine

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
way too noisy to close by the machine

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.840 
way too noisy to close by the machine

it's 450 450 Cummings engine makes a lot

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's 450 450 Cummings engine makes a lot
of<00:02:25.880> noise<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.510> basically<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.100> tub

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
of noise but basically that is a tub

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.510 
of noise but basically that is a tub

around our homes and around our

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.600 
around our homes and around our
buildings<00:03:06.050> come<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.740> over<00:03:07.040> let's<00:03:07.250> look<00:03:07.490> at

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
buildings come on over let's look at

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.210 
buildings come on over let's look at
that<00:03:07.730> machine<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.120> little<00:03:08.450> bit<00:03:08.570> closer

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.200 

this<00:03:13.210> is<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:14.020> device<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.920> churns<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:15.820> cuts

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
this is the device that churns and cuts

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.530 
this is the device that churns and cuts
the<00:03:16.540> wood<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.920> falls<00:03:18.400> down<00:03:18.760> through<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.270> top

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
the wood that falls down through the top

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.690 
the wood that falls down through the top
right<00:03:20.080> here<00:03:20.380> are<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.620> teeth<00:03:20.950> they're

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
right here are the teeth they're

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270 
right here are the teeth they're
attached<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> device<00:03:22.930> called<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.890> hammer

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
attached to a device called a hammer

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.230 
attached to a device called a hammer
these<00:03:25.060> go<00:03:25.420> around<00:03:25.570> at<00:03:25.930> about<00:03:26.020> 2400

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
these go around at about 2400

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.820 
these go around at about 2400
revolutions<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.360> minute<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.840> as<00:03:29.230> they<00:03:29.560> go

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
revolutions a minute and as they go

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.850 
revolutions a minute and as they go
around<00:03:30.010> they<00:03:30.490> they<00:03:31.000> chip<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.260> wood<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
around they they chip into that wood and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.060 
around they they chip into that wood and
create<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.580> mulch<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.990> mulch<00:03:35.020> then<00:03:35.680> falls

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
create the mulch the mulch then falls

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.010 
create the mulch the mulch then falls
through<00:03:36.520> a<00:03:36.550> screen<00:03:36.970> which<00:03:37.180> I'll<00:03:37.360> show<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.660> in

through a screen which I'll show you in

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.780 
through a screen which I'll show you in
a<00:03:38.110> minute<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.590> pulls<00:03:39.040> down<00:03:39.310> into<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
a minute and pulls down into the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.300 
a minute and pulls down into the
conveyer<00:03:40.180> belt<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.750> goes<00:03:41.050> out<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:41.830> what

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
conveyer belt that goes out that's what

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:55.420 
conveyer belt that goes out that's what
creates<00:03:42.760> mulch
