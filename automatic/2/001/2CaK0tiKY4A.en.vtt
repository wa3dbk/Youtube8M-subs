00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
reason why I like the buried starting

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
reason why I like the buried starting
room<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.909> first<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.810> all<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.290> just

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
room so much is first of all it just

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
room so much is first of all it just
looks<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.189> nice<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.939> looks<00:01:57.149> interesting

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
looks really nice and looks interesting

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.359 
looks really nice and looks interesting
can<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.899> spawn<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> big

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can you spawn then you have this big

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
can you spawn then you have this big
hole<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> map<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:01.079> slide<00:02:01.350> down

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
hole in the map and you can slide down

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.180 
hole in the map and you can slide down
to<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
to the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.250 
to the
actual<00:02:02.490> buried<00:02:02.820> map<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.390> course<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> can

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
actual buried map of course you can

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.440 
actual buried map of course you can
return<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> starting<00:02:05.250> room<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.330> the

of course it can only you only have one

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.520 
of course it can only you only have one
opportunity<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> if<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> jump<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
opportunity to get it if it jump on that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.110 
opportunity to get it if it jump on that
ledge<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:35.010> don't<00:02:35.190> buy<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.550> time<00:02:35.760> then<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
ledge we don't buy it in time then it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.060 
ledge we don't buy it in time then it
breaks<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.260> never<00:02:37.350> get<00:02:37.710> it<00:02:37.770> again

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
breaks and you can never get it again

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.280 
breaks and you can never get it again
but<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.120> it's<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:40.170> really

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
but it's there and it's really really

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.250 
but it's there and it's really really
interesting<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:41.580> surprisingly<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.840> der

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
interesting so surprisingly I have der

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710 
interesting so surprisingly I have der
riese<00:02:43.560> from<00:02:43.980> roll<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.610> war<00:02:44.880> zombies<00:02:45.330> coming

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
riese from roll that war zombies coming

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
riese from roll that war zombies coming
in<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> number<00:02:46.500> 2<00:02:46.740> position<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
in at the number 2 position and the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.760 
in at the number 2 position and the
reason<00:02:48.300> why<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.080> map<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.650> is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
reason why I have this map here is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.450 
reason why I have this map here is
because<00:02:50.300> it's<00:02:51.300> really<00:02:51.720> easy<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.350> survive<00:02:52.980> in

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
because it's really easy to survive in

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.280 
because it's really easy to survive in
this<00:02:53.760> story<00:02:54.060> okay<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.780> actually<00:02:55.080> look<00:02:55.230> at

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
this story okay if you actually look at

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.410 
this story okay if you actually look at
this<00:02:55.440> map<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:56.520> doesn't<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.000> anything

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
this map it doesn't have anything

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.480 
this map it doesn't have anything
special<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.990> starter<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.830> the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
special in the starter you have the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.100 
special in the starter you have the
Gewehr<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> wall<00:03:00.330> which<00:03:00.630> really<00:03:00.870> isn't

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
Gewehr on the wall which really isn't

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.170 
Gewehr on the wall which really isn't
anything<00:03:01.470> too<00:03:01.770> special<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
anything too special you have one of the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
anything too special you have one of the
worst<00:03:03.330> wall<00:03:03.630> guns<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> wall<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.620> car<00:03:04.890> 98k

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
worst wall guns on the wall the car 98k

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.970 
worst wall guns on the wall the car 98k
and<00:03:05.880> then<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.660> two<00:03:06.959> doors<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.500> open<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
and then you have two doors to open and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500 
and then you have two doors to open and
that's<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> starting<00:03:09.180> room<00:03:09.270> has

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that's all that the starting room has

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.380 
that's all that the starting room has
not<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.520> does<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.670> look<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:12.209> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
not really does it look really that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.820 
not really does it look really that
crazy<00:03:12.690> nice<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:13.260> looks<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> regular

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
crazy nice it just looks like a regular

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.050 
crazy nice it just looks like a regular
zombie<00:03:14.400> map<00:03:14.640> but<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.780> said<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.620> easy

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
zombie map but like I said it's so easy

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.880 
zombie map but like I said it's so easy
so<00:03:18.060> incredibly<00:03:18.540> easy<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.020> survive<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.739> this

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
so incredibly easy to survive in this

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.550 
so incredibly easy to survive in this
starting<00:03:20.280> room<00:03:20.610> for<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.750> three<00:03:22.080> four<00:03:22.110> or

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
starting room for like three four or

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.740
