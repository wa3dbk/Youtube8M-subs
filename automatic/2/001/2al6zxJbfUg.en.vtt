00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.850
 yes 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.109
 how are we all have new question 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.949
 take option and trico at night 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.949
 we go 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.570
 question very good question why go 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.280
 not our time is going to depend a lot on 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.339
 the things we do during the day 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.440
 maybe we're fined from work and 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.570
 we have to carry out our exercise to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.649
 late at night then you say 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.600
 I'm not going to take a nitric oxide but 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.850
 but what is happening or what is it that 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.899
 program has probably happened to you is 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.269
 I can not sleep face or I can not no 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.399
 I can fall asleep are one of the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.399
 morning two in the morning and again and you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.110
 you really can not sleep for all the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.220
 clicked energy that is going to give you the beta 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.760
 eliminate the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.920
 bullfighting and who knows how much more mother 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.920
 bring in the nitric option that is 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.890
 taking then 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.340
 you must take an option and I do not think 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.610
 bring neither beta eliminates nor taurine falls 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.470
 in an incongruity not for that reason we 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.009
 we take nitric oxide to get 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.320
 that energy makes punches to those desires of 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.210
 to the gym with everything but many times 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.909
 there are meats that say you know that I do not 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.619
 like that feeling when I like having the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.229
 feeling of the ethical options but in 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.240
 strength in with in concentration in 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.640
 resistance in the vascularity of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.940
 click veins so like you 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.310
 they were looking for but they do not like rock 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.520
 they like to have that anxiety for the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.850
 exercise this extra energy after the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.450
 exercise that really lasts longer 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.269
 and more and more time then here is from 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.799
 that you see and that you say is that I'm going to 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.290
 train eight or nine at night 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.080
 then I want to fall asleep 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 I want to get home to dinner knows my 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 good protein myc latina and reconcile the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.409
 I dream to get out 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.620
 I'm glad I'm not like that 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:36.540
 mother and I stay sleep fucking rust 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.970
 nitric of canada 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.549
 that's not bone density is not the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.470
 option point indicated an option 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.500
 electric in that way that brings beta 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.099
 eliminate taurine, the best recommendation is 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.819
 take it on the internal mornings 6 7 a 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.519
 the morning 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.150
 It is excellent if you train at 10 12 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.689
 the morning 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.849
 is excellent but if internal 8 not to the 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:05.170
 night is going to give you a fucking insomnia of the 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.230
 so fucking like what and perfect 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.870
 you're going to a density is going to give you a 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.670
 incredible need to leave running 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.910
 let's see not mames 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 another actress also comes pretty 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.530
 quite strong another one that can do 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.300
 would be the pong swing of promer even 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 they put on your label that you 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.880
 only during the morning 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.650
 really 16 what the fuck do you take this 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.310
 at night you will not be able to sleep 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.709
 it smells things really like that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.650
 so what are the three options 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.530
 what can I give you for a nitric oxide 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.530
 night that will give you strength but 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.620
 nothing resistance concentration 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.190
 vascularity is going to depend on which one you 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.600
 choose then my first option that you 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.030
 I'm going to give 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.870
 is going to be an exploit of psn that's going to be 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.740
 my first choice of nitric oxide for 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 the night my next option that I'm going 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.100
 to give is going to be is that it is bad is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.770
 difficult to choose but to be 3 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.840
 assault the most of form is another very 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.010
 good option option and tico by the 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.110
 night and as a last option it is worth 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:33.560
 difficult but it 's between one no network 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 devils one more pipi network and pool knox 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.630
 of betancourt bulldogs of betancourt lo 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.740
 I recommend a lot as an option and trico 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.950
 for strength but eye I did feel that I 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.040
 gave energy too I did feel then 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.630
 will depend a lot on your tolerance to 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.820
 stimulants will have a better time 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.530
 so much more and if you are that you did not give me 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.450
 no fucking energy but it gave me strength 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.730
 greater resistance medium vascularity 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.250
 then it is forward an option and trico 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.830
 for the night but I think with these 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.380
 four options that I finish 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.170
 to any of those is going to work 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.860
 for a night training all the 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.620
 range that brings beta eliminates taurine or 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.720
 any stimulant you can not 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.840
 take the night you will not be able to sleep here 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.310
 just like that you will not be able to sleep 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:30.080
 then there is the question answered 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.820
 about ethical option at night I do not know 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.500
 forgot any questions any question 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.419
