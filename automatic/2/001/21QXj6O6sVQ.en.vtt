00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.400
 proposal for parties like many of you 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.559
 they know unfortunately I caught the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.590
 chicken pox so I don't think so 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.720
 being able to record video tutorials is one 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.540
 smokey eyes with a very central point 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.029
 bright is completely absent the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.279
 glitter is therefore suitable for all those 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.669
 people who hate him but who actually 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.800
 still want a touch of light for 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.800
 the eyes and the eyes and very intense 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.970

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.080
 I apply black pencils in the beginning 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.700
 of the eye that eventually leaving the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.700
 liberal central part

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.520
 soft white and the purpose ie towards 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.290
 the beginning and towards the end I think the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.850
 most important in this trick e 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.250
