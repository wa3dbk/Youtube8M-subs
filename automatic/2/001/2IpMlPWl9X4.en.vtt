gearlive.com well for now this is just
the<00:03:49.250> unboxing<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.420> unit<00:03:50.750> itself<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.829> can

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the unboxing of the unit itself you can

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.979 
the unboxing of the unit itself you can
see<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.190> TiVo<00:03:52.430> logo<00:03:52.910> as<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.599> see<00:03:53.810> there's

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
see the TiVo logo as you can see there's

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.009 
see the TiVo logo as you can see there's
no<00:03:54.170> isn't<00:03:55.069> have<00:03:55.160> as<00:03:55.280> colorful<00:03:55.670> tebow<00:03:55.940> face<00:03:56.209> now

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
no isn't have as colorful tebow face now

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.349 
no isn't have as colorful tebow face now
I<00:03:57.049> believe<00:03:57.769> that's<00:03:58.010> because<00:03:58.160> these<00:03:59.000> lights

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
I believe that's because these lights

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.080 
I believe that's because these lights
here<00:03:59.750> on<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.590> sides<00:04:00.829> represent<00:04:01.699> all<00:04:01.910> those

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
here on the sides represent all those

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.559 
here on the sides represent all those
tebow<00:04:02.509> colors

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
tebow colors

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.459 
tebow colors
the<00:04:03.689> red<00:04:03.959> green<00:04:05.150> really<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.269> orange<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:06.930> blue

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
the red green really was orange and blue

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.069 
the red green really was orange and blue
so<00:04:08.219> I<00:04:08.579> think<00:04:08.849> one<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> yellow<00:04:09.389> red<00:04:10.049> green

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
so I think one of the yellow red green

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.369 
so I think one of the yellow red green
yellow<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.739> blue<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:12.209> since<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.900> box<00:04:13.139> will<00:04:13.349> be

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
yellow and blue so since the box will be

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.720 
yellow and blue so since the box will be
lighting<00:04:13.650> up<00:04:13.829> with<00:04:14.010> those<00:04:14.099> various<00:04:14.430> colors

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
lighting up with those various colors

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.460 
lighting up with those various colors
anyway<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.450> guess<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:15.959> went<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.229> a<00:04:16.289> more

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
anyway I guess they went for a more

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.310 
anyway I guess they went for a more
subdued<00:04:16.699> Apple<00:04:17.699> desk<00:04:17.910> look<00:04:18.419> then<00:04:18.810> on<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> back

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
subdued Apple desk look then on the back

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.770 
subdued Apple desk look then on the back
so<00:04:20.190> you're<00:04:20.459> going<00:04:20.759> to<00:04:20.849> need<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> cable<00:04:21.209> card

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so you're going to need a cable card

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.800 
so you're going to need a cable card
it's<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.620> Tebow<00:04:22.949> Romeo<00:04:23.520> plus<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.449> pro

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
require cable card they only work with

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.469 
require cable card they only work with
cable<00:04:27.449> you<00:04:27.990> cannot<00:04:28.259> plug<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.740> an<00:04:28.949> antenna<00:04:29.759> you

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
cable you cannot plug in an antenna you

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.110 
cable you cannot plug in an antenna you
have<00:04:30.599> two<00:04:30.780> USB<00:04:30.960> 2.0<00:04:31.710> ports<00:04:32.039> here<00:04:32.250> as<00:04:32.400> well<00:04:33.060> as

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
have two USB 2.0 ports here as well as

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.779 
have two USB 2.0 ports here as well as
an<00:04:33.210> eSATA<00:04:33.570> port<00:04:33.990> for<00:04:34.169> external<00:04:34.500> storage<00:04:34.919> HDMI

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
an eSATA port for external storage HDMI

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.029 
an eSATA port for external storage HDMI
of<00:04:35.910> course<00:04:36.210> there's<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.229> resolution<00:04:37.500> button<00:04:37.919> I

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
of course there's a resolution button I

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.230 
of course there's a resolution button I
guess<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.280> can<00:04:38.400> just<00:04:38.430> keep<00:04:38.669> pressing<00:04:38.970> that

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
guess you can just keep pressing that

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.850 
guess you can just keep pressing that
until<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.110> get<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.410> desired

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
until it's you get the desired

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.260 
until it's you get the desired
resolution<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.699> you<00:04:41.849> want

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
resolution that you want

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.939

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.610 
inputs or outputs a digital audio
optical<00:04:47.270> you've<00:04:48.270> got<00:04:48.449> your<00:04:48.720> cable<00:04:49.110> connection

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
and also that connects to your MOCA

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.290 
and also that connects to your MOCA
network<00:04:52.020> if<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.259> have<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:52.740> or<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.550> just<00:04:54.210> go

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
network if you have one or you just go

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.810 
network if you have one or you just go
with<00:04:54.419> Ethernet<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.949> course<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.580> side

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
with Ethernet and of course on the side

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.719 
with Ethernet and of course on the side
here<00:04:57.240> basically<00:04:57.990> ACN<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.250> said<00:04:59.430> as<00:04:59.520> far<00:04:59.699> as

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
here basically ACN and I said as far as

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.670 
here basically ACN and I said as far as
ports<00:05:00.150> go<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.660> that's<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.960> unit<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:01.590> you

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
ports go and that's the unit for you

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.560 
ports go and that's the unit for you
again<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.039> looks<00:05:02.190> great<00:05:02.460> we'll<00:05:03.240> get<00:05:03.449> it

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
again it looks great we'll get it

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.850 
again it looks great we'll get it
plugged<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:03.990> we'll<00:05:04.199> give<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.440> tour<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.770> the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
plugged in we'll give you a tour of the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.129 
plugged in we'll give you a tour of the
interface<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:05.970> for<00:05:06.210> now<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.419> is<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.750> t-bone

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
interface but for now that is a t-bone
