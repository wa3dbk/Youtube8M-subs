00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
 five points and seven tenths 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.680
 but somewhere 230 just enough will be me 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.680
 thought 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.520
 and he sees even further how much it will be 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 springboard record is similar although there is no green 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.510
 the same band of benefits goes where it jumps 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 really to enter fans and breaking 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.440
 the record will not be about any body brand 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.150
 there could be no question so far 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.270
 flight is a record of course everything is correct 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.290
 250 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.580
 for the first time in history we saw a leap on 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:51.750
 250 meters pleased goran i nurses well and 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.300
 Of course Peter project proves 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.829
 that he is the strongest he is the champion 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.829
 world flight 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.600
 he is the first who traded 250 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 meters he entered forever today in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 story potter project 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.170
 and then what kind of compensation the wind was 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 interesting to see in my nothing 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.860
 of the ultimate 11 gate and something in 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 area minus 7 compensation points yet 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.280
 Repeat times we look and you can many times 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 watch 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 looks gorgeous this flight remains 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 mark is left behind point 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 hills and here's where somewhere already 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.820
 simply contour bias begins 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.820
 flew away 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 is right 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.850
 so well now firstly you need to carefully 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.369
 see if he touched hands no 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.850
 not touched all the normal record will be 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.080
 counted one hundred percent from this 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.209
 plan to gorgeous flight looks well and here 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.950
 from here it can be seen that he flies this 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:21.739
 world record mark but also look 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.550
 Walter Hofer seem pleased jumped from 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.550
 him a little heart such a flight 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.420
 botany 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.630
 and of course now the mood is fine 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.450
 he arrives all the same record held 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.030
 the last jump and so here is beautiful 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.890
 but still took place tomorrow, we can wait 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.670
 be another record 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.010
 appetite comes with eating and this is a wiki 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 in Sumy meal will continue 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.390
