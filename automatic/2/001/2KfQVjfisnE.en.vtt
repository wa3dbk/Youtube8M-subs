blocks approximately four inches by 4
inches<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.650> designed<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.370> machine<00:00:11.759> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
inches we designed a little machine to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.480 
inches we designed a little machine to
make<00:00:12.090> these<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.420> like<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> plunge<00:00:13.799> router<00:00:13.920> with

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
make these up like a plunge router with

make these up like a plunge router with
the<00:00:14.700> vacuum<00:00:15.330> chuck<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> block<00:00:16.650> will

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the vacuum chuck that the block will

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.790 
the vacuum chuck that the block will
stick<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.960> holds<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.590> good

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
stick into holds on there really good

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.390 
stick into holds on there really good
and<00:00:19.920> tight<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:21.350> took<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> cut<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.250> many

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and tight I took and I cut out as many

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
and tight I took and I cut out as many
blocks<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.150> needed<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
blocks as I needed and like about a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.070 
blocks as I needed and like about a
hundred<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> ten<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.269> them<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> whole

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
hundred and ten of them to do the whole

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
hundred and ten of them to do the whole
house<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.710> wrote<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.130> off<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> edges<00:00:29.609> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
house and I wrote it off the edges so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.750 
house and I wrote it off the edges so
they<00:00:30.150> were<00:00:30.210> nice<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.949> rounded<00:00:34.640> put<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
they were nice and rounded put the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
they were nice and rounded put the
blocks<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.300> trim<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.860> end<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
blocks in the trim in the end of the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.250 
blocks in the trim in the end of the
chuck<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.030> there's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.390> vacuum<00:00:39.690> pump<00:00:39.899> that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
chuck and there's a vacuum pump that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100 
chuck and there's a vacuum pump that
holds<00:00:40.559> them<00:00:40.680> down<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.930> go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
holds them down so that when they go

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.319 
holds them down so that when they go
into<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> router<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.829> machine<00:00:44.430> they<00:00:44.820> stick<00:00:45.120> on

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
into the router a machine they stick on

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
into the router a machine they stick on
good<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
good and to get them off you got to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.029 
good and to get them off you got to
actually<00:00:47.370> squeeze<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> holes<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:49.710> release

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
actually squeeze the holes to release

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.750 
actually squeeze the holes to release
something<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> stick<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.270> good

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
something they stick on there so good

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.310 
something they stick on there so good
it's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.090> hollowed-out<00:00:54.449> piece<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.079> wood

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it's just a hollowed-out piece of wood

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.819 
it's just a hollowed-out piece of wood
with<00:00:55.699> some<00:00:56.699> foam<00:00:57.059> window<00:00:57.690> strip<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
with some foam window strip around it to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
with some foam window strip around it to
hold<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.340> place<00:01:00.020> works<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.469> for

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
hold it in place works really good for

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.240 
hold it in place works really good for
that<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> machine<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
that now the machine is actually a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
that now the machine is actually a
radial<00:01:05.250> arm<00:01:05.460> saw<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.150> old<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.110> saw<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.380> off

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
radial arm saw but old one saw it off

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
radial arm saw but old one saw it off
and<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:07.950> mounted<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> router<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and we mounted a router on it and you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600 
and we mounted a router on it and you
can<00:01:09.570> adjust<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> depth<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> router<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
can adjust the depth of the router a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370 
can adjust the depth of the router a
little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> screw<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.170> set

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little bit with a screw so you can set

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
little bit with a screw so you can set
any<00:01:13.530> any<00:01:14.310> depth<00:01:14.700> you'd<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
any any depth you'd like to go with the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.910 
any any depth you'd like to go with the
blacks<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.490> any<00:01:18.360> type<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> pattern

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.199 

once<00:02:23.440> that's<00:02:23.650> done<00:02:24.010> pull<00:02:24.550> them<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.730> let<00:02:25.090> them

with some rubber gloves on or something

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.340 
with some rubber gloves on or something
so<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.210> just<00:02:36.240> stop<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.110> there

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
so you can just stop them right in there

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:48.290 
so you can just stop them right in there
and<00:02:37.530> there<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.370> finished<00:02:38.700> block

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300

and there they are around the doors

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.320 

now<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.740> way<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.130> works<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.060> router

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
now the way this works is the router
