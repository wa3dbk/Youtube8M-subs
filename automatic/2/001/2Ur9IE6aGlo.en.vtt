00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it and I'm pretty excited about it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
it and I'm pretty excited about it
from<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.180> I've<00:01:45.270> read<00:01:45.390> online<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.960> very

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
from what I've read online it's very

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.670 
from what I've read online it's very
short<00:01:47.780> apparently<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:48.930> two<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> three

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
short apparently it's like two to three

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
short apparently it's like two to three
hours<00:01:50.009> maybe<00:01:50.430> closer<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.090> two<00:01:51.240> hours<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.020> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
hours maybe closer to two hours so it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.060 
hours maybe closer to two hours so it's
very<00:01:52.470> short<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.119> apparently<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.450> very<00:01:54.540> good

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
very short but apparently it's very good

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.319 
very short but apparently it's very good
which<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.369> mean<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> coming<00:01:57.000> from<00:01:57.090> Naughty

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
which I mean it's coming from Naughty

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.510 
which I mean it's coming from Naughty
Dog<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> would<00:01:58.170> expect<00:01:58.530> nothing<00:01:58.890> less<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
Dog so I would expect nothing less so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
Dog so I would expect nothing less so

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
mean it's just as engaging as last of us

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.370

was<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.330> really<00:03:27.360> pulls<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.230> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
was and it's it really pulls you in and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.410 
was and it's it really pulls you in and
they<00:03:28.980> did<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.520> little<00:03:29.760> differently<00:03:30.150> than<00:03:30.330> I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
they did it a little differently than I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.830 
they did it a little differently than I
thought<00:03:30.720> they<00:03:31.730> were<00:03:32.730> going<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.240> I<00:03:33.270> guess<00:03:33.570> just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
thought they were going to I guess just

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.570 
thought they were going to I guess just
for<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.020> fact<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.320> everything<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.130> had<00:03:35.250> read

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
for the fact that everything I had read

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.780 
for the fact that everything I had read
about<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.990> DLC<00:03:37.410> pack<00:03:37.590> online<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.460> pushed

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
about the DLC pack online really pushed

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
about the DLC pack online really pushed
this<00:03:39.000> whole<00:03:39.180> prequel<00:03:39.720> thing<00:03:39.990> and<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.290> thought

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
this whole prequel thing and I thought

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
this whole prequel thing and I thought
was<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.860> be<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.040> prequel<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.270> but

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
was going to be a prequel and this but

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.310 
was going to be a prequel and this but
it's<00:03:43.020> it's<00:03:43.830> continually<00:03:44.550> jumping<00:03:45.000> back<00:03:45.320> back

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
it's it's continually jumping back back

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.830 
it's it's continually jumping back back
