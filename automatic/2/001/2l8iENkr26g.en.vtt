00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.199
 of passion fruit is primarily the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.260

 here is the hole I'll put and you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 You have to complete the rest with 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.770
 to be more or less like this, folks 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.239
 and now you should put on the gauge 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.010
 you put it on the display and it's just knocking 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.829

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 I would not hit much now it's the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:10.170
 personal power a beat is tapped 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 and now he leaves aside what he does not 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 As for now we are going to plan is the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.080
 queen 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.880
 I'll check the recipe. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:40.450

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:51.040
 of sugar and hand put two spoons 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:59.860

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.440
 project you hit 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.470
 so it was only an hour to put in the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.470
 everything is the seed everything 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.440
 I just think nothing 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.490
 I always found the accident I do not know if 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.490

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:07.550

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.760
 now the staff will have to assemble a 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:36.519
 I eat with butter here already I already 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.519
 I put the goal 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.709
 now let's take it to the oven 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.530
 remembering the oven must be pre- 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.780
 heated to 180 degrees for 10 minutes 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.860
 well folks if you do not have to wait 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.730
 at least 40 and 30 minutes in the oven and 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.400
 if you want to make the syrup easy and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.980

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.390

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.040
 two tablespoons of icing sugar 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.829
 There is no icing sugar so I go 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:19.789
 use normal sugar the staff is already good 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:24.190

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.190
