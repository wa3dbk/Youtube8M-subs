I had just gotten the iron and I it was

I had just gotten the iron and I it was
my<00:07:59.220> first<00:07:59.490> time<00:07:59.610> trying<00:07:59.880> it<00:08:00.090> out<00:08:00.210> on<00:08:00.390> her<00:08:00.600> hair

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 
my first time trying it out on her hair

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.800 
my first time trying it out on her hair
so<00:08:01.680> I<00:08:01.710> really<00:08:02.190> didn't<00:08:02.580> know<00:08:02.850> what<00:08:03.150> I<00:08:03.300> was<00:08:03.480> doing

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.810 
so I really didn't know what I was doing

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.570 
so I really didn't know what I was doing
with<00:08:03.990> it<00:08:04.110> I<00:08:04.230> was<00:08:04.380> just<00:08:04.530> playing<00:08:04.800> around<00:08:04.950> but

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 
with it I was just playing around but

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.610 
with it I was just playing around but
I'm<00:08:05.850> sure<00:08:06.060> next<00:08:06.360> time<00:08:06.510> I<00:08:06.660> probably<00:08:07.080> will<00:08:07.350> take

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 
I'm sure next time I probably will take

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.830 
I'm sure next time I probably will take
more<00:08:08.100> time<00:08:08.160> on<00:08:08.520> it<00:08:08.550> and<00:08:08.790> not<00:08:08.820> do<00:08:09.150> it<00:08:09.180> as<00:08:09.330> fast<00:08:09.570> I

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 
more time on it and not do it as fast I

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.270 
more time on it and not do it as fast I
just<00:08:10.080> didn't<00:08:10.350> really<00:08:10.530> know<00:08:10.650> how<00:08:10.770> to<00:08:10.830> use<00:08:11.040> it<00:08:11.190> at

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 
just didn't really know how to use it at

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.310 
just didn't really know how to use it at
the<00:08:11.340> time<00:08:11.520> because<00:08:11.670> it<00:08:11.850> was<00:08:11.970> brand<00:08:12.450> new<00:08:12.540> and<00:08:12.780> it

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320 
the time because it was brand new and it

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.890 
the time because it was brand new and it
was<00:08:13.440> my<00:08:13.590> first<00:08:13.740> time<00:08:13.920> using<00:08:14.130> it<00:08:14.400> on<00:08:14.490> her<00:08:14.670> so<00:08:14.970> but

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 
was my first time using it on her so but

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.680 
was my first time using it on her so but
thanks<00:08:16.170> for<00:08:16.290> the<00:08:16.320> advice
