00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
the first thing that's talking about

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.050 
the first thing that's talking about
what<00:02:31.830> around<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> things<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:32.790> talking

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
what around the things I was talking

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.210 
what around the things I was talking
about<00:02:33.120> was<00:02:33.360> how<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:34.230> TV<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.709> kind<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.040> locked

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
about was how this TV is kind of locked

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.090 
about was how this TV is kind of locked
away<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> there's<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.290> we're<00:02:38.010> gonna

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
away and so there's a we're gonna

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100 
away and so there's a we're gonna
pretend<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.790> Plexiglas<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.990> was

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
pretend this is Plexiglas here that was

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.400 
pretend this is Plexiglas here that was
how<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> imagined<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.750> guess<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.290> would

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
how I imagined it and I guess it would

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.600 
how I imagined it and I guess it would
be<00:02:43.500> covered<00:02:43.770> up<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.370> bulletproof

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
be covered up here and it's bulletproof

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.970 
be covered up here and it's bulletproof
glass<00:02:44.940> segments<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> outside<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.650> nobody

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
glass segments on the outside so nobody

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.310 
glass segments on the outside so nobody
can<00:02:47.130> steal<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.459> TV<00:02:47.940> because<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.110> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
can steal that TV because it's this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.650 
can steal that TV because it's this

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
some printed pieces which I thought

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.040 
some printed pieces which I thought
could<00:04:07.769> represent<00:04:08.540> different<00:04:09.540> kinds<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.840> video

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
and these would also be video games and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.830 
and these would also be video games and
Justin<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.830> prints<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:14.700> those<00:04:14.910> 1<00:04:15.660> by<00:04:15.780> 2

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
Justin have prints for those 1 by 2

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.190 
Justin have prints for those 1 by 2
tiles<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:17.030> then<00:04:18.030> these<00:04:18.270> are<00:04:18.330> two<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.870> same

doubt<00:05:50.730> about<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.510> do<00:05:52.020> remember<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.710> I

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
I think Eclipse graphics was the

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.190 
I think Eclipse graphics was the
provider<00:05:56.880> of<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.150> for<00:05:57.600> Philly<00:05:57.780> breakfast

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
provider of that for Philly breakfast

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.740 
provider of that for Philly breakfast
super<00:05:59.160> cool<00:05:59.340> print<00:05:59.610> and<00:05:59.880> I<00:06:00.030> have<00:06:00.150> those<00:06:00.330> three

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
super cool print and I have those three

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.800 
super cool print and I have those three
prints<00:06:01.140> all<00:06:01.260> secured<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:01.860> there<00:06:02.040> quite<00:06:02.280> nicely
