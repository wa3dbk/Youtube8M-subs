00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 dear friend but we can say that I have passed 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.370
 all summer talking only with mine 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.660
 family 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.700
 but tomorrow is my first day of high school 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.700
 and I want to make a change in my life 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.430
 they say that if you make yourself a friend the first one 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 day then go great and novice 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 save toads by force if the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.279
 professor of letters and the only friend 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.699
 what I do today then the thing is 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.699
 depressing 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 sixteen years old 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 it seems that the fun is like that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.570
 welcome to the island of losers 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 like football enjoy sir 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.440
 aggressive boxwood of agrestini but that makes 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.440
 quiet normal 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.560
 if people knew how crazy you are 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.250
 believe that someone would still talk 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.820
 with you come we do madmen 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.800
 together you will do when the ends 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.940
 school I would like to become a writer but not 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 you know what to write 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:29.860
 write about us they call the slut 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:31.690
 the falcon easy to save less crimes 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 ladies and gentlemen who are under the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.780
 average 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.740
 because we all always choose 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.549
 people who treat us like nothing 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.670
 we accept the love we believe of 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.670
 deserve 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.980
 you look at things to boast and there 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.630
 includes don't show up not 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.630
 I thought someone might notice me 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.490
 some people say these things 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.800
 they do not happen I know that one day 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 they will become a story 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.750
 but it is now that we are alive 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.200
 and at this moment 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.170
 I swear 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.170
 we are infinite
