00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.740 

today<00:00:01.020> I'm<00:00:01.110> working<00:00:01.380> on<00:00:01.439> BMW<00:00:01.800> x3<00:00:02.510> the<00:00:03.510> code

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
today I'm working on BMW x3 the code

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.490 
today I'm working on BMW x3 the code
that<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.990> got<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.500> one<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:05.130> p0<00:00:05.430> 4<00:00:06.210> 4<00:00:06.450> 2<00:00:06.690> which

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
that I got on this one is p0 4 4 2 which

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.770 
that I got on this one is p0 4 4 2 which
means<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> small<00:00:08.790> evap<00:00:09.480> leak

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
means that you have a small evap leak

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.370 
means that you have a small evap leak
the<00:00:10.710> evap<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.340> an<00:00:11.460> evaporative<00:00:12.030> system

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
the evap is an evaporative system

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.879 
the evap is an evaporative system
containment<00:00:13.380> unit

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
containment unit

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.000 
containment unit
basically<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.880> contains<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> gases<00:00:16.049> that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
basically it contains the gases that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.630 
basically it contains the gases that
escape<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> take<00:00:17.970> tank<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
escape from the take tank when the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.769 
escape from the take tank when the
temperatures<00:00:20.640> warm<00:00:20.850> outside

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
temperatures warm outside

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.859 
temperatures warm outside
like<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.439> example<00:00:23.420> sometimes<00:00:24.420> I'll<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
like for example sometimes I'll have a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.359 
like for example sometimes I'll have a
gas<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.920> something<00:00:26.779> while<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:28.050> filming

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
gas can or something while I'm filming

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.569 
gas can or something while I'm filming
if<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.519> take<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> gas<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:31.279> set<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.550> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
if I take this gas can I set it out in

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.780 
if I take this gas can I set it out in
the<00:00:32.790> Sun<00:00:33.110> when<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.230> come<00:00:34.469> back<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:35.130> maybe<00:00:35.520> 30

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the Sun when I come back in maybe 30

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
the Sun when I come back in maybe 30
minutes<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.360> an<00:00:36.450> hour<00:00:36.540> it'll<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.559> distended

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
minutes or an hour it'll be distended

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
minutes or an hour it'll be distended
it'll<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.850> blown<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> balloon<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it'll be blown up like a balloon it is a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.500 
it'll be blown up like a balloon it is a
little<00:00:41.399> bit<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.030> pull<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.329> off

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
little bit now and I pull this off

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
little bit now and I pull this off
listen<00:00:43.190> no<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.309> don't<00:00:44.460> hear<00:00:44.610> anything

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
listen no you don't hear anything

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
listen no you don't hear anything
anyway<00:00:45.570> I'll<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.870> Shh<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.190> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
anyway I'll go up Shh and then when it

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
anyway I'll go up Shh and then when it
cools<00:00:47.550> down<00:00:47.670> it'll<00:00:48.120> implode<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.079> let<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cools down it'll implode if I let the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
cools down it'll implode if I let the
gas<00:00:49.860> pressure<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:52.170> makes<00:00:52.350> gasoline

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
gas pressure out but what makes gasoline

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.790 
gas pressure out but what makes gasoline
so<00:00:53.100> volatile<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.910> its<00:00:54.629> ability<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> evaporate

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so volatile is its ability to evaporate

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260 
so volatile is its ability to evaporate
it's<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> gas<00:00:56.460> vapors<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it's actually the gas vapors that you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.160 
it's actually the gas vapors that you
burn<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.719> car<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.469> liquid<00:00:59.160> form<00:00:59.670> gap

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
burn in your car not the liquid form gap

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.510 
burn in your car not the liquid form gap
so<00:01:01.170> anyway<00:01:01.469> those<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.680> harmful<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so anyway those are harmful for the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.039 
so anyway those are harmful for the
environment<00:01:02.840> they<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:04.939> hydrocarbons

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
environment they are hydrocarbons

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.070 
environment they are hydrocarbons
they're<00:01:07.049> HCS<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.479> don't<00:01:09.659> want<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
they're HCS and so we don't want that to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
they're HCS and so we don't want that to
go<00:01:10.200> into<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.310> environment<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.030> save<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
go into the environment so we save it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
go into the environment so we save it
where<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> save<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> charcoal<00:01:14.610> will

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
where we save it is charcoal will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
where we save it is charcoal will
actually<00:01:15.450> absorb<00:01:15.600> those<00:01:16.110> vapors<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.740> hold

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
actually absorb those vapors and hold

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
actually absorb those vapors and hold
them<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.310> you'll<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.670> your<00:01:18.240> gas<00:01:18.420> tank<00:01:18.570> back

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
them so you'll have your gas tank back

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
them so you'll have your gas tank back
here<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.890> you'll<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> charcoal

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
here then you'll have a charcoal

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
here then you'll have a charcoal
canister<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.170> you'll<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> purge

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
canister and then you'll have a purge

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
canister and then you'll have a purge
valve<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.299> charcoal<00:01:24.630> canister<00:01:24.869> will

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
valve the the charcoal canister will

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.010 
valve the the charcoal canister will
absorb<00:01:25.590> those<00:01:25.950> fumes<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
absorb those fumes and then when you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
absorb those fumes and then when you
start<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.560> card<00:01:28.829> they'll<00:01:29.220> go<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
start up your card they'll go up in a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 
start up your card they'll go up in a
hose<00:01:30.710> I'll<00:01:31.710> even<00:01:31.890> show<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
hose I'll even show you where it is on

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.660 
hose I'll even show you where it is on
this<00:01:32.850> car<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.990> I'll<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.619> hose<00:01:34.829> into<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this car but I'll go up a hose into the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
this car but I'll go up a hose into the
intake<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.380> they'll<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.650> sucked<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
intake and they'll get sucked in by the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.050 
intake and they'll get sucked in by the
car<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.540> burn<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.960> fuel<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
car and then burn this fuel so that the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.969 
car and then burn this fuel so that the
car<00:01:42.270> basically<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.049> saves<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.680> till

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
car basically just saves them up till

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.319 
car basically just saves them up till
it's<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> drive<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.990> burn<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:47.329> so

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it's time to drive and then burn them so

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.280 
it's time to drive and then burn them so
on<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.110> evap<00:01:49.500> purge<00:01:49.829> solenoid<00:01:50.670> is

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
on this one the evap purge solenoid is

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
on this one the evap purge solenoid is
right<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.210> can<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> little

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
right down there can you see that little

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
right down there can you see that little
hose<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.500> pointing<00:01:55.890> wiggling<00:01:56.520> my

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
hose that I'm pointing wiggling my

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.810 
hose that I'm pointing wiggling my
finger<00:01:56.909> by<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.640> there's<00:01:59.640> an

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
finger by that's the one there's an

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
finger by that's the one there's an
electronic<00:02:00.299> solenoid<00:02:01.079> underneath<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.649> there

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
electronic solenoid underneath of there

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
electronic solenoid underneath of there
and<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:02.700> another<00:02:03.000> hose<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.719> goes<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
and then another hose that goes to the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
and then another hose that goes to the
intake<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.670> start<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> car<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
intake so when you start up the car and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.630 
intake so when you start up the car and
conditions<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.170> right<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:08.039> computer<00:02:08.489> will

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
conditions are right your computer will

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.630 
conditions are right your computer will
signal<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> open<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.050> it'll<00:02:10.560> slurp<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
signal that to open and it'll slurp it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.270 
signal that to open and it'll slurp it
up<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> big<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.930> into

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
up like a big go up in here into

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.390 
up like a big go up in here into
manifold<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.970> burn<00:02:14.600> those<00:02:14.900> gas<00:02:15.140> papers<00:02:15.680> know

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
manifold and burn those gas papers know

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.350 
manifold and burn those gas papers know
a<00:02:16.430> problem<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.020> environment<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.360> that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
a problem to the environment so that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.960 
a problem to the environment so that
being<00:02:20.930> said<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.100> has<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> leak<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.790> that

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
being said this one has a leak in that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.559 
being said this one has a leak in that
system<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:24.050> what<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.380> code<00:02:24.530> 442<00:02:25.160> means<00:02:25.569> so

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
system that's what the code 442 means so

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.070 
system that's what the code 442 means so
I<00:02:27.319> checked<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> system<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.180> check<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
I checked out the system I check the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.900 
I checked out the system I check the
connections<00:02:30.620> under<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> hood<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.520> checked<00:02:31.760> in

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
connections under the hood I checked in

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
connections under the hood I checked in
there<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.270> gas<00:02:32.450> tank<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.080> check<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.500> cracks

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
there in the gas tank I check for cracks

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.860 
there in the gas tank I check for cracks
in<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.100> EVAP<00:02:34.489> canister<00:02:34.520> you<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.480> maybe<00:02:35.660> got

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
in the EVAP canister you know maybe got

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.199 
in the EVAP canister you know maybe got
hit<00:02:36.050> by<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> rock<00:02:36.260> or<00:02:36.650> something<00:02:37.209> everything's

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
hit by a rock or something everything's

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.110 
hit by a rock or something everything's
okay<00:02:38.980> when<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.010> went<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.340> check<00:02:40.550> out<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.940> gas

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
okay when I went to check out the gas

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.540 
okay when I went to check out the gas
cap<00:02:41.480> also<00:02:42.140> there's<00:02:42.470> no<00:02:42.620> fuel<00:02:42.890> release<00:02:43.280> thing

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
cap also there's no fuel release thing

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.390 
cap also there's no fuel release thing
you<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.850> push<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.330> it's<00:02:44.540> just<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you just push it it's just like the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.970 
you just push it it's just like the
cupboards<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:47.709> entertainments<00:02:48.709> then<00:02:48.830> or

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
cupboards on your entertainments then or

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.520 
cupboards on your entertainments then or
something<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.489> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.880> click<00:02:50.530> so

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
something it just kind of click so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.460 
something it just kind of click so
here's<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> gas<00:02:52.190> cap<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:53.900> found<00:02:54.230> to

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
here's the gas cap and what I found to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.550 
here's the gas cap and what I found to
be<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:55.239> that<00:02:56.239> you've<00:02:56.570> got<00:02:56.750> gas<00:02:56.959> spilling

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
be so is that you've got gas spilling

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.640 
be so is that you've got gas spilling
out<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.769> around<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.780> when<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.050> open<00:03:00.500> it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
out all around here and when you open it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.040 
out all around here and when you open it
it<00:03:01.400> opens<00:03:01.790> really<00:03:02.030> easy<00:03:02.360> easier<00:03:02.780> than<00:03:02.959> it

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
it opens really easy easier than it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.500 
it opens really easy easier than it
should<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.730> not<00:03:04.819> lubricated

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
should but you see it's not lubricated

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.509 
should but you see it's not lubricated
there's<00:03:05.840> no<00:03:05.959> grease<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.500> but<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.100> just

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
there's no grease on that but it's just

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.729 
there's no grease on that but it's just
shiny<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.030> gas<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.660> touch<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:09.709> your

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
shiny with gas you touch it with your

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.559 
shiny with gas you touch it with your
finger<00:03:10.220> smell<00:03:10.610> your<00:03:10.760> finger<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.180> smells<00:03:11.420> like

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
finger smell your finger it smells like

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.830 
finger smell your finger it smells like
gas<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.680> gas<00:03:12.890> caps<00:03:13.220> leaking<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.450> know<00:03:14.540> W

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
gas so this gas caps leaking you know W

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.150 
gas so this gas caps leaking you know W
does<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.140> cool<00:03:15.350> little<00:03:15.560> things<00:03:15.769> like<00:03:15.920> that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
does the cool little things like that

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.090 
does the cool little things like that
where<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.640> set<00:03:16.819> your<00:03:17.200> little<00:03:18.200> gas

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
where you can just set your little gas

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.979 
where you can just set your little gas
cap<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:19.579> there<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.000> like<00:03:20.540> that

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
cap in there I like that

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.800 
cap in there I like that
anyway<00:03:21.950> well<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.850> way<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.120> is<00:03:23.329> supposed<00:03:23.480> to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
anyway well the way this is supposed to

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.130 
anyway well the way this is supposed to
work<00:03:24.019> would<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:24.980> put<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.810> tighten<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.959> and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
work would you put it in tighten it and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.370 
work would you put it in tighten it and
then<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:29.239> does<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> little<00:03:29.660> click<00:03:29.989> at<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.260> end

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
then it does a little click at the end

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.440 
then it does a little click at the end
when<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:30.950> first<00:03:31.190> tighten<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.120> doesn't

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
when you first tighten this it doesn't

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.080 
when you first tighten this it doesn't
make<00:03:32.600> much<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.049> click<00:03:33.350> go<00:03:33.920> back<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.760> forth

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
make much of a click go back and forth

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.030 
make much of a click go back and forth
and<00:03:35.299> then<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.540> makes<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.780> good<00:03:35.930> click<00:03:36.260> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
and then it makes a good click and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
and then it makes a good click and
that'll<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.519> tight<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:38.630> like<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.959> say<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.320> put

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that'll get tight but like I say you put

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.520 
that'll get tight but like I say you put
it<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.829> BAM<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.850> think<00:03:41.060> I'm<00:03:41.239> done<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.290> didn't

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
it on BAM I think I'm done but it didn't

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.979 
it on BAM I think I'm done but it didn't
click<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.190> also<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.120> spring<00:03:44.329> and<00:03:44.600> it's<00:03:44.750> just

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
click and also the spring and it's just

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.130 
click and also the spring and it's just
weak<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.820> leaking<00:03:47.269> it's<00:03:47.900> really

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
weak so this is leaking it's really

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.960 
weak so this is leaking it's really
simple<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.620> replace<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.400> one<00:03:49.579> it's<00:03:49.790> not<00:03:49.850> a

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
simple to replace on this one it's not a
