00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 on the day of the game well, Serafimovich 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.759
 turned out the window is interesting and pretty then 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 that we now watched these games this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 what is called near football in daima 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.580
 just a hundred and thirty five times in my 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 we rest on the fact that despite this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.810
 what can be seen in the plot Dima for not on 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 tremendous work is being done about it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.559
 I think nothing can be unfortunate 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.840
 a large stadium area 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.690
 territory lawlessness and now military 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 Summary, in principle, watched and ending 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 otherwise after the game when asked 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.420
 Slutsky was asked but sports on the second 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.249
 the time came out late is something like 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.679
 would have influenced the game he speaks 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:49.079
 war as in war all means are good 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:53.370
 we're only talking about the war and the football 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.749
 was still a wonderful Spartacus mil 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.760
 advantage of two years with how 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.069
 it was thought to come play Spartak but by 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.579
 the situation at the moment is longer 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.080
 bench more options to 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 somehow vary the composition in the second 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 half, however, the team when the score is 20 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 Well, in general, yes, the last half hour was sitting on 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.020
 Spartak is to blame for its goal 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.470
 himself in the data for Spartacus not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.630
 stability is not in this game drops 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 here in one game such a drop 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.550
 allowed swings in games for example 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.980
 hysterical and then with growth in Spartak 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.160
 This is not a long Scaletta too 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.050
 continues here is the first 60 minutes at 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.930
 which spartak dominated and when there 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.950
 say army trainer about what we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.800
 there are some 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.530
 had the opportunity Spartak was rage and 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.960
 because for him the teams that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.540
 practically misses the top three 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.300
 winners win. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.760
 it it always was it all come true 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.950
 these fans here you play cisco and we 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.510
 forgive you all these you can cover it 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.940
 must even touch the mountain you will enter 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.180
 handling once the coaches told us 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.390
 here it is necessary to play 60 minutes 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.940
 play 90 minutes like this and then talked 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 and here it is impossible to play like this Spartak 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.220
 played 30 minutes can not Spartak gave 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.019
 completely against himself having been afraid that he 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.350
 at the leader at cisco and which now 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.260
 single-handedly people 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.590
 long generally there in a large margin they 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.550
 frightened and also coaching replacements 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.350
 did so they didn't have players in 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.330
 the middle of the field which would take 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 hooked the game away a little 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.920
 lapel and it turned disorderly 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.400
 fighting off boris there just stand waiting 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.720
 something and for 89 minutes my desk now 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 wheelbarrow fans damn 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.330
 I said sit Soviet sport say 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.500
 they combine the bill because everything goes 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.320
 only one way 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 they can't even beat the ball away 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.660
 disgrace but i 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.130
 if you take intact but in the game yes well 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 probably a billion to pay for it 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.350
 who's there someone announced for football we 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.430
 in the second half saw a lot 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.050
 whole chain 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.120
 emotional can be said even nervous 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.380
 disruption player Spartacus it touched in 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.450
 even Andrei Dikan in the end 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 who threw a sword at the referee about what 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.440
 this person is already here we knew iron 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.540
 nerves it was reasonably well here 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.790
 we would sit with you like a picture 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.920
 you can't catch this electric chair 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.690
 it turns out the team loses back and forth 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.590
 and here cisco wins and suddenly on 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.650
 last minute 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.690
 gives a penalty yes he did not see there what is there 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.970
 happened there it is necessary very precisely 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.250
 watch what was with bokketti you before 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.890
 it seemed to return him there he could not 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.240
 pulled but the fact of this moment 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.070
 when dry wagner missed that good girl 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.530
 a big little bit 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.930
 slowed down and here on him just there not 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.420
 there is no doubt and here 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.300
 when you are 20 villas and you are justified and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.220
 the seasons are already successful for you and suddenly 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.130
 this is a last- minute penalty all 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.680
 blame the whole circle and then I will say big 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.970
 Spartacus makes a mistake she 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.730
 today only speaks of in judges 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.880
 and it turns out that they tell the players that 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.890
 In this good fellows and players the past 30 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.810
 minutes just ugly i play no 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.700
 Arnoldych is not the first time talking about 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.070
 Necessary to appoint neutral 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.960
 judges well tobi i mean foreigners on 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.960
 matches like spartak cisco like you 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.180
 think that's possible and voltage 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.970
 This kind of policy is starting with me 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.300
 sprang up the Italian judged Spartak in 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.850
 Tavrida personal contact with a and I found him 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.090
 gazaev there has driven infected through 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.890
 amazing is mean of course 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.550
 it would be better to raise their own 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.290
 but if it really goes that way and there is distrust 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.570
 our destinies have almost everyone on 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.520
 key match do not be afraid 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.740
 invite a foreigner so that later 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.260
 there were these conversations now because all 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.220
 will understand that this did not work 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.900
 somewhere in the corner with a briefcase at all 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.430
 in principle, we have now lately 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.930
 accepted 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.790
 Referee scores per match 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.320
 it does not seem to close officially 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.440
 spread it right that's why 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.070
 it all will lead it all closed i much 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.100
 talked slay and it doesn't and 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.680
 they are better than this 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.930
 better than Vilkov whose judge was insulted 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.260
 un it ate it and so we are with you 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.300
 We think it means that there is something here on 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.090
 the most important thing is that they rise 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.370
 quality of refereeing and the fact that I 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.130
 it seems the leadership of the judiciary 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.430
 I didnâ€™t put it exactly with my hands 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.950
 caught here I was holding the necessary 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.080
 yellow card once did not rest a month 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.960
 the second time did not give rest in any 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.880
 the side here is what they say about 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.000
 one side whistles and the other not 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.370
 whistling and it turns out that not even 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.140
 playing along but somewhere skips alone and 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.890
 same moments and it turns out double 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.750
 standards are what we are talking about 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.060
 move on to fun and at the same time 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.290
 can be scary and from the Russian 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.250
 Football to English is known that 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.460
 English Premier League match between 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.840
 liverpool and chelsea again nabedokuril 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.900
 luis suarez who 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.790
 Chelsea defender Ivanovic bite of 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.350
 shoulder you say in your football 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.960
 practice happened such things when 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.360
 you or the players of your team bit 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.060
 sleep do not spit spit down 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.820
 Of course not, but probably examples from others 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.670
 sports come football maker 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.060
 tyson who mug such deals do 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:36.130
 someone night this is wildness and which 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.850
 but even nothing to discuss but wild 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.340
 man started 8 games from there sat by 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.890
 what someone called out there and proved everything 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.480
 because someone else bit off someone there 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.640
 I played back in the world championship Nalanda 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.210
 Negro cathine crap in any bite 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:55.470
