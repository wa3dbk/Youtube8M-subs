00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:13.610
 Yes it is a Hi or evening learning the two parties after school 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:17.509
 This time in Part 2 of aka liquor in the previous Following management's part 2 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.990
 Well I will talk in an example and one word 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:26.119
 The word Well theme hate 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:29.890
 Well I'd be classified as adjective Well term damage is actually rather than an adjective 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.950
 It's hard to end up asking for such hard things 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 I will talk about the word that I hate 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.680
 so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 The fact is that I did not notice myself 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 When I was in university, I was pretty close to myself and people in Kanto and people in Kansai 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.090
 After all, people who speak the language of Kyushu rarely like this person anymore 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 Because 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.480
 That rare water rare water 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.230
 It was unusual 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.800
 After all that with a still very interested in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.830
 Aren't you talking about adjectives all about science ? 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.490
 I 'm going to sleep already and I 'm going to be a pressurized car or Yoshiya 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.810
 Because I say in the way 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.470

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.260

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.950
 I mean 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.300

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.820
 Speaking of what it is 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.100

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.360
