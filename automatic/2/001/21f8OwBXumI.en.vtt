okay<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:27.959> go<00:02:28.110> around<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.470> press<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.890> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
okay as we go around the press like I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.740 
okay as we go around the press like I
said<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.520> really<00:02:29.849> old<00:02:29.880> press<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.540> see

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
said this is a really old press so see

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that that's like a sensor that's I think

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.990 
that that's like a sensor that's I think
that's<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> squeegee<00:02:34.590> sensor<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.849> not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
that's the squeegee sensor and it's not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.720 
that's the squeegee sensor and it's not
functioning<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:37.500> tell<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.010> stop<00:02:40.730> up

jiggle and fall these the front ends of
these<00:03:27.349> clamps<00:03:27.650> are<00:03:27.890> able<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.250> be<00:03:28.370> raised<00:03:28.700> so

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
these clamps are able to be raised so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.449 
these clamps are able to be raised so
that<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.319> slide<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:32.230> flash<00:03:33.230> unit<00:03:33.739> although

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
that you can slide a flash unit although

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.220 
that you can slide a flash unit although
this<00:03:34.610> flash<00:03:34.910> unit<00:03:35.300> is<00:03:35.390> not<00:03:35.569> really<00:03:35.840> designed

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
this flash unit is not really designed

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.990 
this flash unit is not really designed
for<00:03:36.410> this<00:03:36.620> automatic<00:03:37.160> press<00:03:37.400> but<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.730> works

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
for this automatic press but it works

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.009 
for this automatic press but it works
and<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.560> flash<00:03:39.799> unit<00:03:40.069> is<00:03:40.510> gets<00:03:41.510> slid<00:03:41.840> right

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
and the flash unit is gets slid right

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.309 
and the flash unit is gets slid right
under<00:03:42.410> here<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:45.019> way<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.500> do<00:03:45.650> flash

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
under here and that way you can do flash

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.789 
under here and that way you can do flash
okay<00:03:49.360> so<00:03:50.360> there<00:03:50.569> it<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.319> press<00:03:51.620> is

okay so it's pretty cool and this is
actually<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.120> machine<00:04:38.450> like<00:04:38.630> this<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.050> designed

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
actually a machine like this is designed

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.580 
actually a machine like this is designed
to<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:41.750> actually<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.710> shirt<00:04:43.640> loader<00:04:44.590> who

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
operates the panel and that would really

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.770 
operates the panel and that would really
be<00:04:49.310> right<00:04:49.460> here<00:04:49.730> it's<00:04:49.850> supposed<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.180> be<00:04:50.360> here

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780
