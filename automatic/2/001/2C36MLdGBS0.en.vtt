00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
before I got this one it was Betsy

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.180 
before I got this one it was Betsy
Johnson<00:05:39.200> all<00:05:40.200> every<00:05:40.530> war<00:05:40.620> was<00:05:40.770> Betsy<00:05:40.980> Johnson

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190

i'll have that perfume so much but the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.280 
i'll have that perfume so much but the
Ulta<00:05:43.920> up<00:05:44.340> I<00:05:44.820> guess<00:05:45.300> all<00:05:45.510> ultra<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:45.960> stopped

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
Ulta up I guess all ultra is stopped

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.830 
Ulta up I guess all ultra is stopped
selling<00:05:46.650> Betsey<00:05:46.920> Johnson<00:05:47.480> so<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.510> had<00:05:48.810> to

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
selling Betsey Johnson so I had to

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.570 
selling Betsey Johnson so I had to
settle<00:05:49.530> with<00:05:49.590> this<00:05:49.860> which<00:05:50.100> it<00:05:50.250> smells

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
settle with this which it smells

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.580 
settle with this which it smells
somewhat<00:05:51.180> like<00:05:51.390> Betsey<00:05:51.720> Johnson<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:52.320> think

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
somewhat like Betsey Johnson I think

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.230 
somewhat like Betsey Johnson I think
that's<00:05:52.710> why<00:05:52.830> I<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.310> but<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.120> has<00:05:54.210> just

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
that's why I like it but it has just

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.160 
that's why I like it but it has just
like<00:05:54.480> this<00:05:54.630> hint<00:05:54.930> of<00:05:55.050> vanilla<00:05:55.850> but<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:56.970> like

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
like this hint of vanilla but it's like

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.380 
like this hint of vanilla but it's like
perfect<00:05:58.170> fragrant<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.370> don't<00:06:00.000> even<00:06:00.090> really

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
perfect fragrant I don't even really

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.000 
perfect fragrant I don't even really
know<00:06:00.600> how<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.780> describe<00:06:00.930> it<00:06:01.260> but<00:06:01.590> it<00:06:01.770> has<00:06:01.890> his

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
know how to describe it but it has his

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.370 
know how to describe it but it has his
hint<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.340> vanilla<00:06:02.490> kind<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.360> like<00:06:03.480> Betsy<00:06:04.230> was

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
hint of vanilla kind of like Betsy was

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.750 
hint of vanilla kind of like Betsy was
like<00:06:04.560> that<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:04.980> so<00:06:05.520> good<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:07.980> good<00:06:08.010> so<00:06:08.250> this

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
like that it's so good so good so this

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.470
