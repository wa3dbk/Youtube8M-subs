00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
Gatling gun that wasn't movable didn't

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439 
Gatling gun that wasn't movable didn't
budge<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.440> anything<00:00:55.649> nothing<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.579> hey<00:00:56.789> what

budge or anything nothing like hey what
if<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.660> did<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> motorized<00:00:58.680> Gatling<00:00:59.340> gun<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.510> I

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
if I did a motorized Gatling gun so I

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
if I did a motorized Gatling gun so I
grabbed<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.859> battery<00:01:02.070> boxes<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
grabbed one of my battery boxes and a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
grabbed one of my battery boxes and a
motor<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.470> integrated<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.640> together<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
motor and integrated it all together to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.140 
motor and integrated it all together to
make<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.200> sweet<00:01:08.119> deal<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:12.570> cool

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
make this sweet deal this is really cool

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
make this sweet deal this is really cool
one<00:01:15.150> thing<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> didn't<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.350> having<00:01:16.619> such

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
one thing I didn't like was having such

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
one thing I didn't like was having such
a<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.070> battery<00:01:17.340> box<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.509> then

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
a big battery box on the back but then

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
a big battery box on the back but then
I'm<00:01:18.659> thinking<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.619> hey<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.490> could<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> big

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
I'm thinking like hey it could be a big

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.679 
I'm thinking like hey it could be a big
it's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> big<00:01:21.390> ammo<00:01:21.840> box<00:01:23.180> right<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> big

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
it's a big ammo box right it's a big

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's a big ammo box right it's a big
ammo<00:01:24.900> box<00:01:25.229> or<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> ammo<00:01:26.040> belt<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.790> chain<00:01:27.259> going

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
ammo box or the ammo belt or chain going

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.010 
ammo box or the ammo belt or chain going
to<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.880> better<00:01:31.610> yep<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:33.869> got

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to it that is better yep and so it's got

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.719 
to it that is better yep and so it's got
this<00:01:34.259> which<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> looks<00:01:35.640> like

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
this which actually kind of looks like

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.080 
this which actually kind of looks like
an<00:01:35.909> ammo<00:01:36.060> belt<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.680> flip<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.820> start

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
an ammo belt I flip it up to start

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230 
an ammo belt I flip it up to start
turning<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.520> effort<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.670> motor<00:01:41.909> start

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
turning it effort to motor start

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920 
turning it effort to motor start
motorizing<00:01:42.710> do<00:01:43.710> note<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> very<00:01:45.450> hard

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
motorizing do note this is a very hard

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
motorizing do note this is a very hard
to<00:01:46.079> figure<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.530> pose<00:01:46.740> without<00:01:47.159> friction

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to figure to pose without friction

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
to figure to pose without friction
adders<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.659> recommend<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.680> put

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
adders I do recommend that you put

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
adders I do recommend that you put
friction<00:01:50.460> adders<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.390> decide<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
friction adders in this if you decide to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.350 
friction adders in this if you decide to
do<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.740> friction<00:01:53.250> adders<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.149> leg

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
do this put friction adders in the leg

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260 
do this put friction adders in the leg
joints<00:01:54.990> alright<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:57.000> very

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
joints alright you will not be very

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
joints alright you will not be very
sturdy<00:01:57.799> one<00:01:58.799> thing<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.219> makes<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.579> look<00:01:59.759> even

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
sturdy one thing that makes it look even

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.950 
sturdy one thing that makes it look even
better<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.020> fact<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:04.969> um<00:02:05.969> he<00:02:06.570> shakes

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
better is the fact that um he shakes

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.760 
better is the fact that um he shakes
when<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.910> flip<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:10.319> he<00:02:10.440> shakes

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
when it's on flip it up that he shakes

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.600 
when it's on flip it up that he shakes
when<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:12.000> those

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
when it's on at those

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.300 
when it's on at those
really<00:02:13.420> hard<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.690> pose<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.190> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
really hard to pose so I'm going to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.980 
really hard to pose so I'm going to
probably<00:02:15.490> grab<00:02:15.790> some<00:02:16.030> money<00:02:16.210> friction<00:02:16.660> adders

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
probably grab some money friction adders

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.870 
probably grab some money friction adders
I<00:02:17.170> have<00:02:17.470> another<00:02:17.710> mock<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.430> working<00:02:18.610> on

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
I have another mock that I'm working on

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.770 
I have another mock that I'm working on
that<00:02:18.940> has<00:02:19.270> my<00:02:19.600> some<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> my<00:02:20.080> friction<00:02:20.470> hours<00:02:20.770> so

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that has my some of my friction hours so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.300 
that has my some of my friction hours so
sometimes<00:02:22.780> if<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.530> don't<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:23.830> him

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
sometimes if you don't get him

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.250 
sometimes if you don't get him
you<00:02:24.640> almost<00:02:24.790> gotta<00:02:25.090> lean<00:02:25.330> forward<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.840> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
you almost gotta lean forward just a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.480 
you almost gotta lean forward just a
little<00:02:26.320> bit<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.800> gotta<00:02:27.040> bring<00:02:27.190> his<00:02:27.340> gun

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
little bit then you gotta bring his gun

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.840 
little bit then you gotta bring his gun
up<00:02:30.450> yeah<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:32.470> how<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> video<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.790> is

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
up yeah see how in the video it is

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.320 
up yeah see how in the video it is
turning<00:02:34.750> really<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:36.160> slow<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.180> can

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
turning really really slow and you can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.070 
turning really really slow and you can
see<00:02:37.510> each<00:02:37.660> individual<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:39.100> real<00:02:39.820> life

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
see each individual thing in real life

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.200 
see each individual thing in real life
right<00:02:41.080> now<00:02:41.110> as<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:42.100> speaking<00:02:42.130> as<00:02:42.820> I'm

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
right now as I'm speaking as I'm

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.890 
right now as I'm speaking as I'm
recording<00:02:43.360> this

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
recording this

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.920 
recording this
it<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.440> spinning<00:02:44.770> much<00:02:45.340> faster<00:02:45.400> now<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.750> may

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
it is spinning much faster now it may

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.630 
it is spinning much faster now it may
spend<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.710> if<00:02:47.890> you've<00:02:48.070> got<00:02:48.100> older

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
spend like that if you've got older

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.120 
spend like that if you've got older
batteries<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.390> yours<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.200> mine<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.680> spinning

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
batteries and yours but mine is spinning

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.560 
batteries and yours but mine is spinning
really<00:02:51.340> fast<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.030> actually<00:02:52.180> look<00:02:52.540> like

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
really fast and I actually look like

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.740 
really fast and I actually look like
it's<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.680> shooting<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.480> another

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it's really shooting so and another

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.199 
it's really shooting so and another
thing<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.230> note<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.610> battery<00:02:58.030> box

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
thing to note I have the battery box

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.150 
thing to note I have the battery box
thing<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:59.110> that<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.280> because<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:02.160> camera

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
thing up that is because this camera

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.100 
thing up that is because this camera
we're<00:03:03.310> using<00:03:03.520> is<00:03:03.820> switching<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.420> around<00:03:04.480> in

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
we're using is switching it around in

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.680 
we're using is switching it around in
the<00:03:05.860> camera<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:06.490> going<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.060> way<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.209> want<00:03:07.600> it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
the camera it's going the way I want it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.390 
the camera it's going the way I want it
to<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.110> way<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:11.350> in<00:03:11.440> real<00:03:11.680> life<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.250> I'm

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
to this way but in real life as I'm

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.180 
to this way but in real life as I'm
speaking<00:03:12.550> it's<00:03:13.090> going<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.140> going<00:03:14.770> that

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
speaking it's going this it's going that

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.120 
speaking it's going this it's going that
way<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.790> way<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:18.010> you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
way not that way so when you if you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.840 
way not that way so when you if you
decide<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.610> do<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:18.880> flip<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.570> down<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.850> then

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
decide to do this flip it down and then

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.600 
decide to do this flip it down and then
it'll<00:03:22.120> spin<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:23.200> way<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.410> want<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.890> now<00:03:24.340> in

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
it'll spin the way you want it to now in

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.780 
it'll spin the way you want it to now in
the<00:03:24.730> video<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.390> not<00:03:25.480> spinning<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.230> way<00:03:26.790> so

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
the video it's not spinning that way so

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.199 
the video it's not spinning that way so
um<00:03:28.000> yeah<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:29.160> definitely<00:03:30.160> recommend<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.910> try

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
um yeah I definitely recommend you try

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.560 
um yeah I definitely recommend you try
doing<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.750> Mach<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:33.430> super<00:03:33.880> duper<00:03:34.000> easy<00:03:34.180> as

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
doing this Mach it's super duper easy as

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.560 
doing this Mach it's super duper easy as
long<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.019> have<00:03:35.140> hero<00:03:35.680> factory<00:03:36.250> parts<00:03:36.670> as

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
long as you have hero factory parts as

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.949 
long as you have hero factory parts as
long<00:03:37.810> as<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.050> have<00:03:38.170> hero<00:03:38.440> factory<00:03:38.709> parts<00:03:39.430> a

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
long as you have hero factory parts a

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.229 
long as you have hero factory parts a
battery<00:03:40.959> box<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.470> motor<00:03:41.920> you're<00:03:42.820> pretty<00:03:43.120> much

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
battery box a motor you're pretty much

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.930 
battery box a motor you're pretty much
set<00:03:43.660> now<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.470> don't<00:03:44.920> have<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.160> do<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.580> just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
set now you don't have to do with just

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.699 
set now you don't have to do with just
your<00:03:46.180> factory<00:03:46.690> parts<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.140> could<00:03:47.320> make<00:03:47.500> like

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
your factory parts you could make like

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.100 
your factory parts you could make like
this<00:03:48.000> ultra<00:03:49.000> figure<00:03:49.390> out<00:03:49.540> of<00:03:49.720> some<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.019> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
this ultra figure out of some of the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.800 
this ultra figure out of some of the
other<00:03:50.320> parts<00:03:50.739> Lego<00:03:51.010> has<00:03:51.340> but<00:03:52.209> I'm<00:03:52.360> otherwise

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
other parts Lego has but I'm otherwise

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.860 
other parts Lego has but I'm otherwise
