00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
think i have about fourteen hundred or
so<00:00:12.929> kills<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.740> i<00:00:14.700> managed<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> pull<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.630> this

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
so kills and i managed to pull out this

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.660 
so kills and i managed to pull out this
30<00:00:17.539> killstreak<00:00:18.539> gameplay<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.220> nuclear

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
30 killstreak gameplay and get a nuclear

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
30 killstreak gameplay and get a nuclear
medal<00:00:21.150> which<00:00:21.300> gave<00:00:21.510> me<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> new<00:00:21.810> player<00:00:22.080> card

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
medal which gave me a new player card

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.330 
medal which gave me a new player card
and<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.670> emblem<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.650> it's<00:00:25.650> pretty<00:00:25.859> cool<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and an emblem and it's pretty cool I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.179 
and an emblem and it's pretty cool I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.099 
guess it's called a nuclear med away
apparently<00:00:29.939> there's<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.269> after<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.869> read

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.780 
apparently there's one after it I read
about<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.410> 35<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.860> better<00:00:35.070> kill

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
about where you get a 35 or better kill

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.600 
about where you get a 35 or better kill
streak<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.320> unstoppable<00:00:37.890> metal

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
streak and you get an unstoppable metal

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.440
