halo franchise I'm you know there's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.200 
halo franchise I'm you know there's
definitely<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> lot<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> things<00:00:50.850> they're<00:00:51.090> going

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
definitely a lot of things they're going

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.299 
definitely a lot of things they're going
to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.390> familiar<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:52.050> again<00:00:52.410> feels<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to be familiar people again feels like a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.729 
to be familiar people again feels like a
halo<00:00:53.550> game<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.809> expanded<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.410> lot<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
halo game but it's expanded a lot of

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.709 
halo game but it's expanded a lot of
significant<00:00:56.460> ways<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
significant ways that I think one of the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
significant ways that I think one of the
biggest<00:00:57.870> differences<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.620> people<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
biggest differences for people is going

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
biggest differences for people is going
to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> local<00:00:59.670> basically<00:01:00.030> graphics<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.770> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
to be the local basically graphics or we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.429 
to be the local basically graphics or we
have<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.340> new<00:01:02.899> some<00:01:03.899> new<00:01:04.049> ways<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
have kind of a new some new ways of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.530 
have kind of a new some new ways of
rendering<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> graphics<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
rendering the graphics from the it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 
rendering the graphics from the it's
kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> an<00:01:06.900> evolution<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> engine<00:01:07.860> some

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
kind of an evolution of the engine some

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490 
kind of an evolution of the engine some
of<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:09.420> rebuilt<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> ground<00:01:10.170> up

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of it we we rebuilt from the ground up

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740 
of it we we rebuilt from the ground up
some<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.760> part<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> sort<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
constantly evolving nature of the engine

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
constantly evolving nature of the engine
but<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> bunch<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.450> new<00:01:15.570> game<00:01:15.780> features

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's not so much a broadening exercise
it's<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> find<00:01:56.820> new<00:01:57.119> ways<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.500> to

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's really a way to find new ways to to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's really a way to find new ways to to
tell<00:01:58.710> stories<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.790> have<00:02:00.240> people

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
tell stories and to have people

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.789 
tell stories and to have people
experience<00:02:00.990> gameplay<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.619> when<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
experience gameplay I think when you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
experience gameplay I think when you
have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.610> let's<00:02:02.790> say<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.030> an<00:02:03.119> eight

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
demand a giant investment in time and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.370 
demand a giant investment in time and
effort<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:45.090> people<00:02:45.330> who<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.990> know<00:02:46.020> if<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
effort for people who you know if you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.600 
effort for people who you know if you
have<00:02:46.470> other<00:02:46.590> things<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.920> do<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.280> maybe<00:02:47.430> have

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
have other things to do and maybe have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.550 
have other things to do and maybe have
jobs<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.240> go<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.780> stuff<00:02:48.990> like<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.200> but

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
jobs to go to and stuff like that but

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.230 
jobs to go to and stuff like that but
it's<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.460> definitely<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> new<00:02:51.060> way<00:02:51.210> to

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
it's a it's definitely a new way to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.150 
it's a it's definitely a new way to
distribute<00:02:51.780> gameplay<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.500> fiction<00:02:52.860> for<00:02:53.040> us

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
distribute gameplay and fiction for us

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.310 
distribute gameplay and fiction for us
so<00:02:53.790> creating<00:02:54.360> those<00:02:54.450> story<00:02:54.780> elements<00:02:55.170> does

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
so creating those story elements does

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720 
so creating those story elements does
that<00:02:55.410> mean<00:02:55.530> you've<00:02:55.680> pulled<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:56.130> different

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that mean you've pulled in different

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430 
that mean you've pulled in different
disciplines<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.540> terms<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.080> movie

makers<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.950> storytellers<00:02:59.520> into<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.820> studio

makers and storytellers into the studio

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
makers and storytellers into the studio
I<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.840> they're<00:03:00.960> generally<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.560> video<00:03:02.010> game

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
I think they're generally the video game

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.040 
I think they're generally the video game
industry<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.730> starting<00:03:03.060> draw<00:03:03.330> from<00:03:03.540> Hollywood

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
industry is starting draw from Hollywood

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.720 
industry is starting draw from Hollywood
and<00:03:04.200> vice<00:03:04.350> versa<00:03:04.800> there<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.250> know<00:03:05.340> sometimes

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
and vice versa there you know sometimes

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.550 
and vice versa there you know sometimes
people<00:03:05.850> get<00:03:06.150> hired<00:03:06.420> into<00:03:06.720> Hollywood<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.380> of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
people get hired into Hollywood out of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.110 
people get hired into Hollywood out of
the<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:08.010> video<00:03:08.250> game<00:03:08.490> industry<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> think

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the the video game industry and I think

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.250 
the the video game industry and I think
it's<00:03:09.240> because<00:03:09.360> there's<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.750> lot<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.900> things<00:03:10.140> in

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it's because there's a lot of things in

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.990 
it's because there's a lot of things in
common<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.920> technologies<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.790> same

for<00:03:12.240> example<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.530> storytelling<00:03:14.220> is

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
for example but storytelling is
