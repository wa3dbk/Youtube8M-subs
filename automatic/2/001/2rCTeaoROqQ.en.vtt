00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.470 
especially this thought this set is
extremely<00:02:40.530> small<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.849> cruises<00:02:42.060> three

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
extremely small and it cruises three

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880 
extremely small and it cruises three
minifigures<00:02:42.900> rather<00:02:43.200> than<00:02:43.440> one<00:02:43.709> or<00:02:43.739> two

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
minifigures rather than one or two

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.979 
minifigures rather than one or two
because<00:02:44.400> usually<00:02:44.580> these<00:02:44.910> size<00:02:45.300> sets<00:02:45.780> come

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
because usually these size sets come

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.640 
because usually these size sets come
with<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.920> maximum<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.790> two<00:02:48.030> set<00:02:48.650> minifigures

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
with it a maximum of two set minifigures

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.170 
with it a maximum of two set minifigures

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and then on here I can get it back on so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.890 
and then on here I can get it back on so
we<00:02:57.239> do<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.629> this<00:02:57.870> gun<00:02:59.150> with<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.330> hook<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
we do get this gun with the hook on it

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
we do get this gun with the hook on it
and<00:03:01.400> also<00:03:02.400> some<00:03:02.819> handcuffs<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:04.430> probably<00:03:05.430> put

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and also some handcuffs to probably put

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.059 
and also some handcuffs to probably put
on<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.290> does<00:03:07.560> swivel<00:03:08.010> around

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069
