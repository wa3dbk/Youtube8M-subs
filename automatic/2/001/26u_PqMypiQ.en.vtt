we're<00:00:00.420> gonna<00:00:00.510> go<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> streamlined<00:00:01.589> dolphin

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
we're gonna go a streamlined dolphin

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.579 
we're gonna go a streamlined dolphin
kick<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.850> back<00:00:03.410> specifically<00:00:04.410> we're

kick on the back specifically we're

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.920 
kick on the back specifically we're
gonna<00:00:04.650> look<00:00:04.950> for<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.339> pressing<00:00:06.000> motion<00:00:06.480> from

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
gonna look for that pressing motion from

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.640 
gonna look for that pressing motion from
Kelsey's<00:00:07.440> chest<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.540> her<00:00:09.540> back<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.200> nice

pressing motion that's gonna transfer

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.680 
pressing motion that's gonna transfer
energy<00:00:12.750> or<00:00:13.469> power<00:00:13.740> down<00:00:14.130> into<00:00:14.490> her<00:00:14.580> kick<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.570> we

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
energy or power down into her kick so we

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
energy or power down into her kick so we
call<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> Blacko<00:00:16.770> dolphin<00:00:17.310> kick

it's a nice rhythmic movement we want an
even<00:00:30.390> amount<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.050> energy<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.800> pressure<00:00:32.240> going

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
even amount of energy or pressure going

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.590 
even amount of energy or pressure going
up<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.130> see<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.730> little<00:00:36.270> bit<00:00:36.480> of

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
up and down you see just a little bit of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.570 
up and down you see just a little bit of
movement<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.560> hands<00:00:37.950> up<00:00:38.070> at<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.340> top<00:00:38.550> of
