00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.820
 is always difficult because you end up 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.200
 his stages some competition 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.789
 mat in the legs not swimming at night 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.650
 someone your competitions much half 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.920
 won 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.230
 18 years there are 9 they have won and that 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.390
 seventeen league goals makes them 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.550
 smaller also does not smell inside it is one 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.060
 flower that plays wax from a 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.499
 241 from and 532 occupancy 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.980
 they do well how this closed 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.980
 downtown 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.480
 they have a striker running that strong 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 is that body she has we very much 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.080
 experience in the team and we have to 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.880
 pay attention because is a team that are 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.670
 own pace can training it is one 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.770
 team that can lean back but yes 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.860
 and then in footballers and time out 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.020
 can grab and we need to worry about 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.770
 tomorrow night like that actually in the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.560
 previous two machine and tim that chose 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.449
 myself for stamp I then have here 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.220
 that is just the treasure then skill and none 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.780
 make a temple then you can also do a die 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 qualify I already have to see fill 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.740
 and belgium in europe we do n't want anyone 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.570
 underestimating if there is today 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.980
 that third for being under it then it is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.050
 because we are no better or those countries 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.300
 then we also need a little bit and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.010
 accepted I read chosen but must 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.330
 then our coefficients work but us 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.320
 coefficient is so layers we can now 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.680
 besides get there we are all 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.810
 responsible for and we have with 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.799
 all there could be the coefficients 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.080
 to push up 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.520
 everyone so we will do everything we can 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.180
 so that we must do and the first 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.190
 macho and the second much me 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 Who knows me knows that I always have a whole 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.030
 much respect talks about the opponent 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.480
 and I often see that in it 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.370
 Belgium 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.560
 yes it is an opponent we don't 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.650
 know it's country poland restaurante 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 of which show whether balor is 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.520
 And then we think about his job too 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.130
 but we are already very much out of the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.750
 erase scissors in those preliminaries and or 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.860
 that now by venus mars or by 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.510
 Icelanders 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.670
 and we must do our work in which 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.010
 i think like a tomorrow or temples inside 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.700
 our much about those two games while 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.580
 matte we can have a look at 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 our a sunday also what one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.640
 did not stand well in the 1st half was one 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.290
 bit difficult but we corrected it 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.030
 to the rest and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.820
 to come back to the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.250
 correct i think i have a good tire that 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.620
 tries to find solutions 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.590
 Flexibility is at the top in it 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.580
 football and I think if I put them next 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.739
 put each other flat and and silla that have 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.570
 both so much disguised 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.810
 they are technically strong they have 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.950
 stature they have intellect they can 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.170
 to score 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.060
 I was there next to every other floor 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.760
 put in first class 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.040
 we are real off as a duo that if I am 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.030
 and let slaves play that cell with that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.330
 can get very far 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 but we do n't have a lot with it 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.299
 looking at the positions for me is it 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.130
 idea of ​​football always a lot 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.060
 more importantly I remember that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.280
 I returned here two years ago 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.450
 my baby and well played up 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.790
 finally on 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.970
 yes , only seven and half and half and 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.739
 Half was a bit new but they did 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.140
 at the brilliant in that position and 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.610
 same down and assiste after the other and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.470
 empty played in the back of nasas 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.280
 Impress someone else's impression 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.049
 leather 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.840
 so as a coach, that flexibility is involved 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.220
 We could work and we fell on it 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.280
 you do not go them at some point 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.290
 start thinking more like if they were 9 or even 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.910
 not as 11 you think as a player 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.110
 the team and think there today 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.239
 most important thing is i have about 10 i have 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.549
 played against a team last year 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.769
 the Monday after that we lost him there 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.579
 stood braking newspapers 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.319
 I have a great attacking duo all our stays 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.069
 you never again 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:00.150
 it reflects it there 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.829
 we now lost to 5 2 and I got it 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.120
 about foxes in boijl 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.370
 He never knew any more talks about that 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.370
 Mommy can take you over the valve 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.819
 day would not have been wise now 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.200
 his injury 2nd something else are two 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.299
 beautiful players let me know that 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.789
 but courtney grain for that 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.060
 most and for most a story of it 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.340
 team crow and Marie return to it 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.530
 Business day job read and hear types go 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.340
 why a35 no longer has a place for two players 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.130
 I t could for me than anything else out 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.110
 so are you who conditions place 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.090
 is to win is place to win 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.039
 and live to do everything to many buddy 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.169
 to win and play very high 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.810
 but I have never said that we 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.080
 this year at 352 skin love-doll at 442 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.310
 smeer i know how that we how that we 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.900
 animated should bring football in 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.880
 possession and what we have to do and 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 moreover, they do a lot of things in it 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.330
 action with that team a lot 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.789
 options also played on Sunday 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.830
 Annie chain close to flat in the first 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.270
 half second half he has a little more 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.740
 He has all the space between and let 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.810
 be closed to him than can be in that space 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.210
 go with twice sat and the result 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.180
 but on but it just stood up 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.099
 much better and how strange that sounds to me 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.360
 had played with two 9th but on 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:16.620
 they started to divide certain moments 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:23.070
 like en what are the take if you then 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.520
 focus back to the first half but 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.590
 our silla has been hurt and sick 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.150
 is and what park god has in mind 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.669
 bring because you come later Sure 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.889
 is then compared kompletter even 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.300
 admit then you can not be further 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.229
 and prepare both of us once 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.539
 to play together 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.409
 mark carney i have said there to poland 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.080
 and I stick with that 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.090
 I am going to grow those two and one is against it 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.650
 play each other that the road does not have then 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.539
 You always got those in the bank who replied 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.880
 and I don't do that I'm going to solutions 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.620
 search if they are both good that is 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.360
 their absolute condition 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.550
 look for solutions to help them 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.680
 play and that is my job as a coach then 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.110
 weeks then I do and can do continuously 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.820
 maybe later 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.430
 I would just like something beautiful 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.100
 tiara and day 3 formidable central 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.240
 Distributors have perhaps we have to 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.650
 then search for a solution again 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.610
 maybe we can with the further 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.520
 play 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.740
 many many three times with two that of the 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.330
 all view to the top of the poor 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.890
 neighborhood fantastic and field that we are 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.630
 with decent and accelerate to 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.100
 europe league that it should do me in 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.120
 the way room spot gets it 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.370
 izaro 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.230
 I ca n't do that with anything 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.540
 approach and my players keep within 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.160
 to be competitive in the playoffs 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.410
 who had our time and that 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.270
 August and canals come two more three 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.430
 players will be in the perfect 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.790
 changes the system perfect 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.800
 where for my system though i 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.420
 football how we want to play football 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.230
 we cannot play football indirectly 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.550
 to skip 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.740
 how are we going to change that side with that 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.080
 players how do we go depth passes because 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.540
 how are we going to move side of the ball and 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.580
 and you have to drag it and I think 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.790
 that we are on our way to a very beautiful one 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.080
 cart with the balance left foot right 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.560
 good balance attack and distribution 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.630
 younger than 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.920
 younger than usual but this is our this 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.710
 is our objective 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.930
 I think we are on the right track but 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.120
 that will be confirmed every week 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.970
 by either growing or maybe by one 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.610
 times less result we are not one 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.990
 everyone but we want we want whole 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.210
 get far into it 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.860
 we want a passage what can that be 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.300
 it fails because the fourth much is possible 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.870
 maybe if we continue 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.760
 a very tough preliminary round but we 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.250
 must sinner to also in the competition 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.880
 we want we want a good season 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.470
 game 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.410
 We know that we had lost players 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.810
 we don't talk about it anymore because we 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.550
 all energy data and we turn to the
