00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
video this piece this super piece here

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
video this piece this super piece here
which<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.079> makes<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.310> bit

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.319 
which is makes it look a little bit
longer<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:35.119> with<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
longer if this would be and with that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.069 
longer if this would be and with that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
Eva clutch would be definitely not so

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.899
