00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:04.190
 the spectators welcome to a new issue of CP TV 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.840
 Matter thing, my colleague Thomas Hafen had the new Blackberry 8800 today 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.669
 brought 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.899
 what is the difference to its predecessors 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.170
 that is already the look of the other he looked like Dr 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.579
 Percent Consumer Blackberry Curve so will this black paint too 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.929
 thinner than that 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.699
 other Blackberry's with this full-fledged keyboard and he had 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.329
 no 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.470
 Clegg also wanted to go back for 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.249
 Looks chic from the yet good in the hand 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.110
 July in the hand with Dr 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.550
 I am not so satisfied with processing 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.990
 and that is a minimum wage shaky creak so i know i just have to 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.400
 at this one and he lays or east 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.059
 but a common problem is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.330
 so supply 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.390
 professional device it is too nice for me said Crack Boll im 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990
 Compared to this little scollo what you used to have 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.600
 like Stani navigation with this at Attica control this is very good so you 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.460
 can boulder here with the track 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.650
 why by the EM 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.950
 Navigate applications 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.170
 for gross motor skills that make it less suitable for a bit of emotions 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 Daum then have to meet there too 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 Heat with radio networks from which one can use 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.980
 the Blackberry 8800 supports all major gsm networks worldwide 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.640
 supports GPRS and Edge 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.970
 and Bluetooth, however, no meanwhile no w-lan Bayer is that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 problem 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.680
 that is not a problem for the percent for the normal purpose so then 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 She manages to get her Song Black on board in supposed communication 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.140
 for it so loose problem because the emails Mr. compressed to be transmitted 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.250
 And you do not need a high bandwidth, but it's also on the internet 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.120
 Webbrowser installed if you surf the internet 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.830
 would like to 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 then of course it would be nice to have registrations Holborn keep it up 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.920
 Lewin tests or could open in a wlan hotspot upset Minty 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.900
 BS receiver is also integrated percent can be because the device 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.660
 now also use as a navigation device 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.740
 So in principle already that it is also near soft on it 90 percent 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.010
 Blackberry Maps 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.370
 this is pulling 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.319
 So how can it be done? 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.439
 quite as his location set 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.320
 around 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.860
 if you navigate there in the diocese percent responds relatively slow 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 so navigation cab is not enough 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.379
 It sends it with other modes Media functions from about the camera 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.650
 the camera had not built in such a way percent needed in the bus 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.709
 it will be levels 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.920
 A business device and many companies prohibit keeping the camera in this 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.729
 Companies 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.169
 So big hurdle to me as relevant area 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:40.080
 You can, however, use the 8800 baker as an mp3 player 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.269
 can save his songs on an IQ sd card 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.769
 the company 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.989
 the biggest card 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.689
 this pretty small one is pretty clear that it is difficult with the town hall me 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.909
 can show it here 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909
 Zotti had a very small card, that's the card 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.079
 around 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.650
 after all, outlines Tymoshenko has responded to criticism before Werder Card 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.089
 Stud under the acute means one must them that this urgently needs 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.229
 Turn Blackberry off 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.959
 now you can see the cows the the migros the card also in running 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.749
 switch 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:11.889
 Yes and 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.129
 Who would you see as a target group now? 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.409
 Target audience is sure as usual in the blackberry listening the 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.230
 Business traveler the business user who is traveling a lot is on the go 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.469
 want to edit his e-mails his appointments 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.639
 Tasks so nothing has changed has changed a lot 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.669
 Of course leaves can be combined with one 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.379
 Blackberry Enterprise Server Comac then like the others too 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.999
 But he also offers the possibility of ten normal pop3s 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:38.519
 Concept around 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.820
 set up and let them from there in March 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.419
 It should not only be used for large companies but also for us 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.259
 suitable for small businesses that do not operate their own enterprise servers 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.079
 most exciting question at the end 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.719
 what does the device cost and which network operators offer the St 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.650
 that makes it so surprising to have from 160 euros 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.899
 depending of course on the contract 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.779
 To contract costs about 60 euros 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.589
 and that's how the Mobber Vodafone has it 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.379
 So the second largest 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.179
 good grannies then thank you i owed you an execution 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.849
 the viewers also thank Delft for watching DSi pay-tv 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.319
 until the next market
