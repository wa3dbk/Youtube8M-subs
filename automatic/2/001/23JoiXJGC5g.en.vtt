00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 missing in stuffing eto he takes a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.080
 i cut fi so with small cubes 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.090
 it keeps its shape well so the cubes 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.850
 turn out neat and not 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.970

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.550
 I am covering the second cake 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.340
 stuffing if you like going by satisfying 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.460
 You can also add finely chopped 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.670
 smoked meat 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.010
 fry for a couple of minutes on low heat 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.070
 left the most difficult after 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.950
 one side will roast deftly turn over 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.580
 cooking dish to be fried and 2 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.730
 cake 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.620
 can i give you simple advice if you donâ€™t 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.680
 enough experience to perform 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.020
 this somersault is not spilling stuffing can 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.930
 instead of roasting put the dish in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.390
 an oven for two or three minutes of course 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.959
 crisp does not work but will 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.000
 also delicious and another moment when 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 will spice up the stuffing salt 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.580
 a little fetax has a gentle word 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.550
 salty taste and for someone it can 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.570
 be quite enough now cut 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.070
 your cake into 4 pieces and serve to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.090
