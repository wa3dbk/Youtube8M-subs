00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
have less gray hair now I mean I think

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.550 
have less gray hair now I mean I think
it's<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> angle<00:00:14.450> maybe<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.230> stress

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's just the angle maybe but if stress

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.470

gives<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.010> more<00:00:17.190> gray<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:18.090> would<00:00:18.240> make<00:00:18.449> sense

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
gives you more gray it would make sense
