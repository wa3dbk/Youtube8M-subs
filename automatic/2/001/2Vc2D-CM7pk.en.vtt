little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.290> extra<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:46.740> time<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.220> then

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
little bit extra this time and then

for<00:03:34.219> the<00:03:34.280> fourth<00:03:34.549> method<00:03:34.879> I'm<00:03:35.030> using<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.450> little

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
for the fourth method I'm using a little

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.330 
for the fourth method I'm using a little
blue<00:03:35.930> earring<00:03:36.379> and<00:03:36.560> stamping<00:03:36.859> off<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.159> back

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
blue earring and stamping off the back

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.009 
blue earring and stamping off the back
of<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.579> with<00:03:37.760> my<00:03:37.879> wire<00:03:38.120> cutters<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.659> then<00:03:38.840> with

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
of it with my wire cutters and then with

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.179 
of it with my wire cutters and then with
the<00:03:39.139> ring<00:03:39.349> I'm<00:03:39.530> going<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:39.739> repeat<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.040> whole

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
the ring I'm going to repeat the whole

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.800 
the ring I'm going to repeat the whole
process<00:03:40.609> but<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.209> time<00:03:41.359> we're<00:03:41.510> going<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.659> add

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
process but this time we're going to add

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.360 
process but this time we're going to add
a<00:03:42.019> little<00:03:42.319> loop<00:03:42.469> right<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:42.980> middle<00:03:43.159> of<00:03:43.280> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
a little loop right in the middle of the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.979 
a little loop right in the middle of the
ring<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:43.790> it'll<00:03:43.969> be<00:03:44.060> front<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.420> center<00:03:44.780> this

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
ring so it'll be front and center this

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.360 
ring so it'll be front and center this
is<00:03:45.439> where<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.709> earring<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.069> going<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.249> be

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
is where the earring is going to be

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.739 
is where the earring is going to be
attacked<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:46.969> the<00:03:47.030> loop<00:03:47.209> gives<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.540> just<00:03:47.569> a

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:47.749 
attacked and the loop gives it just a

to be receiving the hard knuckle ring so

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.800 
to be receiving the hard knuckle ring so
I<00:05:19.700> thought<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.240> was<00:05:20.390> maybe<00:05:20.630> the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
I thought that that was maybe the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.330 
I thought that that was maybe the
hardest<00:05:21.170> one<00:05:21.350> that<00:05:21.530> people<00:05:21.800> might<00:05:22.010> not<00:05:22.040> really

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
hardest one that people might not really

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.040 
hardest one that people might not really
want<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.790> attempt<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:23.570> I<00:05:23.600> figured<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:24.020> I

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
want to attempt so I figured that I

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.900 
want to attempt so I figured that I
would<00:05:24.200> give<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.530> away<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.800> one<00:05:25.010> of<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.190> guys<00:05:25.340> so

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
would give it away to one of you guys so

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.370 
would give it away to one of you guys so
I<00:05:25.940> hope<00:05:26.030> you<00:05:26.150> guys<00:05:26.240> enjoyed<00:05:26.630> it<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.140> will
