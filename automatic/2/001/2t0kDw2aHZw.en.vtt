00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.080 
features that we wanted to see
implemented<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.989> future<00:02:17.379> cameras<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.090> what's

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
implemented in future cameras and what's

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.030 
implemented in future cameras and what's
so<00:02:19.450> encouraging<00:02:20.080> for<00:02:20.230> me<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.500> at<00:02:20.680> six<00:02:20.920> months

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
so encouraging for me is at six months

so encouraging for me is at six months
down<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> line<00:02:21.459> we're<00:02:21.910> seeing<00:02:22.180> these

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
down the line we're seeing these

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.150 
down the line we're seeing these
features<00:02:22.810> implemented<00:02:23.709> now<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.069> this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
features implemented now in this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.650 
features implemented now in this
production<00:02:24.610> camera<00:02:24.970> which<00:02:25.209> was<00:02:25.390> shooting

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
production camera which was shooting

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.920 
production camera which was shooting
with<00:02:25.690> today<00:02:26.910> shooting<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.030> candlelight<00:02:28.540> it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
with today shooting and candlelight it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.449 
with today shooting and candlelight it
was<00:02:29.110> really<00:02:29.590> impressed<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.069> see<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.430> really

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
was really impressed to see we really

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.789 
was really impressed to see we really
didn't<00:02:30.970> need<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.150> increase<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.080> ISO<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
didn't need to increase the ISO of the

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.970 
didn't need to increase the ISO of the
camera<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.640> images<00:02:33.910> were<00:02:33.970> very<00:02:34.269> clean<00:02:34.510> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
camera the images were very clean I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
camera the images were very clean I
think<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> really<00:02:36.190> interesting<00:02:36.610> inclusion<00:02:37.599> on

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
think a really interesting inclusion on

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.089 
think a really interesting inclusion on
this<00:02:37.840> camera<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> fact<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.980> can

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
this camera it's the fact that you can

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.100 
this camera it's the fact that you can
actually<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.730> stills<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:41.079> a

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
actually take stills with it and for a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.259 
actually take stills with it and for a
lot<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.230> people<00:02:41.670> they<00:02:42.670> wouldn't<00:02:42.970> care<00:02:43.090> about

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
lot of people they wouldn't care about

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.479 
lot of people they wouldn't care about
this<00:02:43.540> as<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> function<00:02:44.110> but<00:02:44.230> actually<00:02:44.650> it's

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
this as a function but actually it's

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.550 
this as a function but actually it's
incredibly<00:02:46.000> useful<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.569> do<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.720> lot<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.870> product

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
incredibly useful I do a lot of product

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.650 
incredibly useful I do a lot of product
based<00:02:47.799> shoots<00:02:48.250> where<00:02:48.610> all<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.269> want<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.569> be

no<00:03:03.430> problems<00:03:03.910> with<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.329> camera<00:03:04.660> we<00:03:05.200> could

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
no problems with this camera we could

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.250 
no problems with this camera we could
change<00:03:05.739> locations<00:03:06.459> quickly<00:03:07.109> monitoring<00:03:08.109> the

change locations quickly monitoring the
shots<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.950> easy<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:10.269> could<00:03:10.450> use<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.750> on

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
shots was easy and it could use it on

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.809 
shots was easy and it could use it on
different<00:03:11.500> rigs<00:03:11.799> in<00:03:12.100> various<00:03:12.609> situations

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
different rigs in various situations

different rigs in various situations
this<00:03:13.780> camera<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.590> ideal<00:03:15.370> for<00:03:15.639> everything<00:03:16.209> you

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
this camera is ideal for everything you

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.020 
this camera is ideal for everything you
did<00:03:16.510> with<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.959> DSLR<00:03:17.739> or<00:03:18.010> epicenter<00:03:18.639> before

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
did with you DSLR or epicenter before

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.440 
did with you DSLR or epicenter before
because<00:03:19.630> though<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:21.250> has<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.700> much<00:03:21.970> more

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
because though it has so much more

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.410 
because though it has so much more
features<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.950> we<00:03:24.160> somehow<00:03:24.579> managed<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.389> to

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
features so we somehow managed it to

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.140 
features so we somehow managed it to
keep<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.019> modular<00:03:26.440> approach<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.850> form

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
keep the modular approach and the form

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.470 
keep the modular approach and the form
factor<00:03:28.480> almost<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> same<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.819> still<00:03:31.180> can

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
factor almost the same so you still can

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.090 
factor almost the same so you still can
shoot<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.079> your<00:03:32.290> pockets

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
shoot out of your pockets

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.220 
shoot out of your pockets
