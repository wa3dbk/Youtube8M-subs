00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hi girls in today's video what 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.859
 I'm going to do is teach the three 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.649
 costumes that you can do to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.679
 halloween but these costumes are not 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.960
 the costumes that you have to look for thousand 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.759
 things to be able to make them the costumes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 who has been planning one or two months 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.449
 these costumes are the costumes that you 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 you do an hour before you have to go to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.609
 a site and you have thought about it and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.900
 Suddenly I got myself looking by 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.189
 internet a lot of costumes from 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.870
 inspiration to inspire a little bit in what 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 what I wanted to do and I've seen that all 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.129
 the costumes are super elaborate 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.590
 you have to buy success that and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.200
 it takes a while to think about buying 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 things are going, you need time and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 you need more effort but the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 costumes that I wanted to show you today 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.050
 they are disguises that that not any 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.110
 we have at home are super easy to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.789
 make it take literally half an hour if 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.350
 is what you have to go to the party that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.359
 be invited if you have to go out to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 some place disguised if you do not know that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.700
 put on I think these costumes are 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 super easy are super super easy 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 I wanted to give you these ideas in case 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.180
 is in that situation and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.969
 you need a quick idea and nothing is going 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.979
 to start the first round which is the most 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.020
 easy is to simply disguise ourselves 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.140
 basketball player or player 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.240
 basketball you can put any type 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.939
 of uniform that you have of some sport 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.920
 and it's that easy for me what I'm going to do 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 is to make a tall ponytail and we're going to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.189
 need the shirt of that sport 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 some sports shorts and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.080
 a rubber band of hair and that's how you can 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.090
 see this costume can be any 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.810
 thing I have put on clothes in the husband 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.459
 and it suits me very well and that if you do not know 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.069
 you have no idea what to put or 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.319
 just look in the form of some 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.250
 sport that you have done and you were already 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.250
 of athlete 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.740
 that disguise is also very easy for 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.150
 they are using in the bicrim or 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.760
 you can use a foundation 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.740
 the truth does not matter what you use and 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.170
 then I will go with a black eyeliner 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.850
 and I'm going to delineate my eyes by making myself 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.130
 a line a little bit fat than 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.720
 normal and a little rabito like 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.640
 I 'm always going to fill in a little 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 eyebrows I'm going to blur the color 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.510
 but this is totally optional and it 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.430
 I had happened to tell you that I like it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.590
 give me a translucent powder in the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:40.340
 eyelid before going with the line to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.050
 that is not transparent and how I want 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 make eyes a little like the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.010
 of a doll found me at home 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.540
 false eyelashes so I got the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.370
 I'm putting but if you do not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 you have maybe maybe not 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.600
 you just have to put a bunch of 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.140
 mascara on lashes of 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.240
 up and then with a black eyeliner 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.920
 liquid I'm clogging the glue 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.550
 so that you can see the lashes a lot more 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.800
 natural 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.260
 I'm not going to apply a little bit of rouge 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.540
 in pink and with this I will not write 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.640
 I'm going to put a lot to be 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.920
 note a lot the color is halloween like this 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.960
 that we really do not have to go with 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.100
 natural makeup or anything like that 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.990
 but we have to take a 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.820
 stronger than normal makeup for 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.950
 it shows so I'm getting 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.260
 pretty blush and then a little bit 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.000
 tanning 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.989
 for the lips has been opted for a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.989
 Vaseline with color 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.500
 and we're done with makeup 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.690
 let's go with the hair I'm going to divide everything 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.260
 the hair in two pieces and I'm going to braid 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.260
 each side 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.420
 and if you have not heard about 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.300
 that we are moving we are 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.520
 enjoying cowboy ground cowboy or 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.950
 cowgirl and what we're going to need is 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.200
 some jeans a shirt to 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.200
 pictures some boots and a hat 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.310
 and we already have the end this can not be 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.050
 as much for boys as for girls 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.640
 just the same things and really 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.460
 mystics do not have to have 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.440
 false eyelashes or two braids but now 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.440
 You see how easy it is to recreate 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.020
 and we go quickly with the last look and 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.790
 for this I'm going to base myself on 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.740
 makeup on the whole face because I want 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.599
 have the face without any imperfection 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.830
 I'm going to apply a little powder 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.470
 translucent on the eyelids 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.720
 and I go with the outlined this delineated 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.730
 it really does not need to be perfect 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.800
 we just have to make sure 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.750
 lilia is not very close to the eyelashes and 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.040
 that no piece of skin remains 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.170
 discovered 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.570
 let's take the line to the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.230
 tear and we will surround the eye by 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.230
 full 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.220
 once we have our eyes completely 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.860
 delineated let's go with a shadow 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.810
 matte black and we're not going to put it that much 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.420
 over the delineated like a little 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.550
 above the eyelid and we're going to 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.800
 blur the color 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.680
 Last step with eyes a little 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.960
 eyelash mask 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.759
 the next step is totally optional 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.100
 also but I wanted to define myself a 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:22.870
 tiny on the cheekbones to give it a 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.870
 more structured look to the face 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.970
 we go with the hair and for this later 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.710
 we're going to need smooth hair so 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.389
 I'm going to smooth it with an iron and what 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.400
 first thing I'm going to do is decently give me 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.350
 the hair and I go with the iron 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.060
 my trick to straighten my hair with the 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.460
 iron is to pass me the iron very 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.900
 slowly for each strand for only 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.900
 have to pass it once 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.140
 we finish making our hair and we are going to 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.030
 make us the line very very very next and 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.150
 this is going to be a combed mix of 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.750
 mixture of rock do not know very well but 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.610
 it's a little disheveled I do not know I think 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.830
 which is perfect for the look and for 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.710
 then we're going to need some pants 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.320
 blacks a black shirt some boots 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.750
 black with a hundred in a black one 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.990
 black jacket we are going to that you have to 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.150
 dress whole black and with also 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.000
 fits well with tacks or studs 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.520
 golden and you have golden accessories and 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.170
 this is the final look 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.820
 let's say it's a mixture of emotion 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.370
 I want and this same look can 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.560
 do both boys and girls because it is 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.710
 that whole of black and outlined in the 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.710
 eyes 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.670
 and we're done with the video as 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.890
 you have seen in the costumes are hyper 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.290
 easy to do for people who are 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.610
 in another world like me normally and it 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.200
 you forget that the cinema has to be done 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.060
 disguise and at the last moment you are crazy 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.460
 thinking that is going to put I think that 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.960
 these misfortunes are perfect and they do not 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.730
 forget if you are ever recreated 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.740
 some of the looks to send me a 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.410
 picture by twitter or instagram because I 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.240
 I would love to see how he has stayed and not 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.340
 you forget to label that yes so that 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.170
 can comment and can see the photo and 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.060
 I do not expect you to have a pretty 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.570
 week and see you in the next video 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.570
 see you later
