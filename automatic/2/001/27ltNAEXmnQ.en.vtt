00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:01.939
 well 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.230
 per cent in spite of that complicated mechanisms here on the shoulder because 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
 outline azerbayán red up here do not add up more 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.349
 forward and backward 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.289
 360 degrees 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.999
 the elbow turns 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.259
 forward and backward but not 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.070
 turn sideways 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.179
 neither has articulation 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.529
 that the plan can make tours 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.149
 the head turned a little 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.029
 can be put looking up 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.250
 down 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.050
 and good after 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.360
 the joint is very justito also p 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.260
 pretty pretty just the possibility because it's good 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 osx who is releasing this over time 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.990
 the possibility is good as duty as a friend thanks to these huge feet 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.370
 that has nothing to do with the cartoon perez the figure is like that 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.500
 and good that I am going to say is that the pacifier 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.269
 is not the best figures really is the hottest of regulars in 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.300
 As far as molds are concerned aesthetically it's not pretty like Beijing 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.070
 especially with weapons 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.790
 very very pretty 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 but it is the typical figure that sword to put them 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.950
 and if you're reading this extra time 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 because this 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.080
 is the typical figure for 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.080
 transform it and leave peace and 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.800
 that looks 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.150
 As if it's pretty 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.250
 but when playing with her 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 what has been said 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 has few joints the arms the shoulders are easily released 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 the plastic is pretty good it's hard 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.510
 but good posts what are 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.970
 this sense the plan 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.720
 It is a normal figure 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.030
 regular 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.159
 It is not bad but neither does the entity lend them much less 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.670
 country many other figures that are worthwhile to buy them distant this 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.290
 felt the country proxecto aoglp schaars optimal for entering megatron home 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.599
 in its center 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.659
 but if you have bought all of them, it is not superfluous to have a sentinel 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.789
 as we say 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.619
 in the rival we say to holed mop to complete the guard of the liter if 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.479
 is that you have for others 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.839
 board members 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.739
 of that guard 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.809
 so ninth place 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 I think I've already commented basically 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.749
 this has been a nursery 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.969
 quite improvised I had not planned to do it so I do not know if gil 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.680
 what I said is well said mandisoví as a conquest I leave you 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.889
 this little widow's minier 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.999
 sentinel therefore the line for my mind 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.459
 I am stars min 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.219
 I say goodbye
