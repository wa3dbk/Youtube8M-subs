00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:18.649 

as<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.550> can<00:01:07.670> tell

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.459 

it's<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.530> pretty<00:01:19.740> good<00:01:19.950> shape<00:01:20.310> 4-h<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:21.719> been

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
it's in pretty good shape 4-h has been

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.620 
it's in pretty good shape 4-h has been
driven<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.070> though<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:24.060> why<00:01:24.329> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
driven a lot though so that's why it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.700 
driven a lot though so that's why it's
got<00:01:25.170> kind<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.740> heat<00:01:26.039> wear<00:01:26.280> inside<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.750> might

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
got kind of heat wear inside but I might

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
got kind of heat wear inside but I might
eventually<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.460> later<00:01:29.759> because

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
eventually get to that later because

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
eventually get to that later because
it's<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.570> those<00:01:30.689> older<00:01:31.049> cars<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.770> when

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it's one of those older cars back when

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.760 
it's one of those older cars back when
they<00:01:32.130> had<00:01:32.659> they<00:01:33.659> back<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.320> were<00:01:34.350> easier

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
they had they back when they were easier

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.460 
they had they back when they were easier
to<00:01:34.890> repair<00:01:35.329> like<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.539> notice<00:01:36.929> how<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> thing

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to repair like I notice how the thing

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
to repair like I notice how the thing
the<00:01:37.710> stereo<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.520> those<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.819> can

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the stereo is the one those you can

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
the stereo is the one those you can
replace<00:01:39.210> easily<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> might<00:01:41.159> get<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
replace easily so I might get to that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
replace easily so I might get to that
eventually<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.530> my<00:01:43.649> first<00:01:43.860> car

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
eventually but for now it's my first car

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.889 
eventually but for now it's my first car
