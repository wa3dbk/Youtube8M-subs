and<00:01:39.329> create<00:01:40.079> another<00:01:40.290> layer<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.860> grass<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and create another layer of grass so

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
and create another layer of grass so
you'll<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.930> green<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> more

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you'll see this time this green is more

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
you'll see this time this green is more
of<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> metallic<00:01:44.399> finish<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.060> again<00:01:45.540> by

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
of a metallic finish and again by

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.179 
of a metallic finish and again by
layering<00:01:46.049> everything<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> gives<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.009> more

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
layering everything up it gives a more

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
layering everything up it gives a more
of<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.340> three-dimensional<00:01:48.210> effect<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of a three-dimensional effect so now the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.649 
of a three-dimensional effect so now the
grass<00:01:50.280> looks<00:01:50.579> much<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.149> brighter<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
grass looks much more brighter and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.630 
grass looks much more brighter and
three-dimensional<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
three-dimensional and we can make it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.310 
three-dimensional and we can make it
even<00:01:53.970> more<00:01:54.000> 3-dimensional<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:54.990> drawing

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
even more 3-dimensional by drawing

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.190 
even more 3-dimensional by drawing
daisies<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.950> dot<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.790> white<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
daisies so dot some white and then use a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
daisies so dot some white and then use a
bobby<00:01:58.530> pin<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> dotting<00:01:59.549> tool<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.939> you're

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bobby pin as a dotting tool and you're

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.719 
bobby pin as a dotting tool and you're
just<00:02:00.840> pretty<00:02:01.079> much<00:02:01.290> making<00:02:01.770> five<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.490> dots

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
just pretty much making five little dots

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.790 
just pretty much making five little dots
for<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> petals

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
for the petals

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.950 
for the petals
okay<00:02:05.830> so<00:02:06.070> that<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.370> super<00:02:06.580> easy<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.120> just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
okay so that was super easy and just

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.690 
okay so that was super easy and just
keep<00:02:08.170> repeating<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.740> same<00:02:08.770> steps<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.430> you<00:02:09.490> can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
keep repeating the same steps so you can

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.820 
keep repeating the same steps so you can
decide<00:02:09.970> how<00:02:10.000> many<00:02:10.210> daisies<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.990> want<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.470> each

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
decide how many daisies you want on each

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.500 
decide how many daisies you want on each
meal<00:02:12.130> maybe<00:02:12.370> some<00:02:12.700> yields<00:02:13.060> could<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.300> one

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
meal maybe some yields could have one

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
meal maybe some yields could have one
daisies<00:02:13.870> some<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.320> up<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.650> next<00:02:15.580> step<00:02:15.880> taking

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
daisies some get up to next step taking

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.330 
daisies some get up to next step taking
a<00:02:16.240> toothpick<00:02:16.600> I'm<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.200> dragging<00:02:17.440> each<00:02:17.890> petal

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
a toothpick I'm just dragging each petal

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.670 
a toothpick I'm just dragging each petal
into<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.850> center<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.840> creates<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.380> very

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
into the center and this creates a very

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.010 
into the center and this creates a very
pretty<00:02:21.240> three-dimensional<00:02:22.240> floral<00:02:22.720> effect

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
pretty three-dimensional floral effect

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.800 
pretty three-dimensional floral effect
so<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> recommend<00:02:24.490> doing<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.060> plan<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
so I recommend doing this plan the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.990 
so I recommend doing this plan the
polish<00:02:26.320> has<00:02:26.590> dried<00:02:26.650> about<00:02:27.280> half<00:02:27.490> way<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:27.760> you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
polish has dried about half way so you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
polish has dried about half way so you
don't<00:02:28.150> want<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.390> polish<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.840> completely<00:02:29.320> dry

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
don't want to polish me completely dry

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.190 
don't want to polish me completely dry
it<00:02:29.950> off<00:02:30.190> or<00:02:30.430> too<00:02:30.760> wet<00:02:31.000> grabbing<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> bobby<00:02:31.960> pin

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
it off or too wet grabbing the bobby pin

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.990 
it off or too wet grabbing the bobby pin
again<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.860> start<00:02:33.100> dotting<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.580> yellow<00:02:33.850> in

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
again just start dotting the yellow in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.210 
again just start dotting the yellow in
the<00:02:34.090> center<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.660> daisies<00:02:35.130> adding<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the center of the daisies adding the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.740 
the center of the daisies adding the
yellow<00:02:36.460> is<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.030> completes<00:02:37.600> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
yellow is what really completes it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.510 
yellow is what really completes it
because<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.230> creates<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.650> beautiful<00:02:38.920> spring

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
because it creates that beautiful spring

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.480 
because it creates that beautiful spring
contrasting<00:02:40.210> effect<00:02:40.650> let<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.770> dry<00:02:41.950> completely

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
contrasting effect let it dry completely

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.160 
contrasting effect let it dry completely
and<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:43.150> add<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.390> topcoat<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:44.110> seal

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and then add a topcoat to seal

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.870 
and then add a topcoat to seal
everything<00:02:44.500> off<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.220> doesn't<00:02:45.250> chip<00:02:45.640> or

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
everything off so it doesn't chip or

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.720 
everything off so it doesn't chip or
fade<00:02:46.090> easily<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:48.130> what<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.520> guys<00:02:48.670> are

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
fade easily I know what you guys are

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
fade easily I know what you guys are
thinking<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.420> guys<00:02:49.510> are<00:02:49.570> thinking<00:02:49.810> bubs<00:02:50.200> what

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
thinking you guys are thinking bubs what

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.470 
thinking you guys are thinking bubs what
I<00:02:50.560> put<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.740> other<00:02:50.980> halfs<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.730> be<00:02:51.850> really<00:02:52.150> honest

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
I put my other halfs to be really honest

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.240 
I put my other halfs to be really honest
with<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.690> guys<00:02:52.720> in<00:02:53.140> my<00:02:53.530> experience<00:02:54.100> working

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
with you guys in my experience working

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.740 
with you guys in my experience working
on<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.700> other<00:02:54.850> hand<00:02:55.120> isn't<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.570> much

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
on the other hand isn't that much

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.120 
on the other hand isn't that much
different<00:02:56.170> from<00:02:56.320> working<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.709> your<00:02:56.950> better

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
different from working on your better

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.440 
different from working on your better
hubs<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.730> that's<00:02:57.880> because<00:02:58.150> you're<00:02:58.300> just

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
hubs and that's because you're just

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.420 
hubs and that's because you're just
making<00:02:58.750> stripe<00:02:59.080> motions<00:02:59.500> as<00:02:59.890> when<00:03:00.160> flowers

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
making stripe motions as when flowers

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.160 
making stripe motions as when flowers
you're<00:03:00.880> just<00:03:01.090> dotting<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.930> don't<00:03:02.080> need

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
you're just dotting it so you don't need

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.500 
you're just dotting it so you don't need
as<00:03:02.380> much<00:03:02.620> control<00:03:03.070> trust<00:03:03.670> me<00:03:03.820> trust<00:03:04.120> me<00:03:04.360> guys

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
as much control trust me trust me guys

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.540 
as much control trust me trust me guys
is<00:03:04.690> not<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.110> bad

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
is not that bad

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.800 
is not that bad
finally<00:03:06.550> my<00:03:06.790> spring<00:03:07.090> wheels<00:03:07.300> are<00:03:07.480> complete

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
finally my spring wheels are complete

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.360 
finally my spring wheels are complete
and<00:03:08.050> I<00:03:08.350> really<00:03:08.590> does<00:03:08.769> paint<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.190> perfect

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
and I really does paint a perfect

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.220 
and I really does paint a perfect
picture<00:03:09.580> for<00:03:09.880> spring<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:10.930> kind<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.140> a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
picture for spring and it's kind like a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
picture for spring and it's kind like a
painting<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.709> do<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.130> sky<00:03:12.370> hearse<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.880> then

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
painting you do to sky hearse and then

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.759 
painting you do to sky hearse and then
the<00:03:13.150> grass<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.630> then<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> flowers<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.650> has

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769
