00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
one flash you got to use some triggers

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.540 
one flash you got to use some triggers
like<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.500> 622<00:00:52.500> CE<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like this here this is the 622 CE you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.770 
like this here this is the 622 CE you
know<00:00:54.440> our<00:00:55.440> TTL<00:00:56.100> trigger<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:57.000> works<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.539> most

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
know our TTL trigger it works with most

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.630 
know our TTL trigger it works with most
of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> compact<00:00:58.590> flashes<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
of the compact flashes that are out the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
of the compact flashes that are out the
market<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.149> clips<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> hot<00:01:01.170> shoe

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
market just clips down to the hot shoe

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.280 
market just clips down to the hot shoe
and<00:01:01.820> now<00:01:02.820> we're<00:01:02.969> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:03.809> adapter

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and now we're going to see which adapter

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
and now we're going to see which adapter
works<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.220> next<00:01:05.460> adapter<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.060> going

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
works with the next adapter we're going

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.380 
works with the next adapter we're going
to<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> T<00:01:07.950> type<00:01:08.220> adapter<00:01:08.700> looks

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to look at if the T type adapter looks

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890 
to look at if the T type adapter looks
like<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.939> picture<00:01:11.939> mount<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.750> the
