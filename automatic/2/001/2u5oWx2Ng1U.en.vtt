00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.509
 television more than ever very good 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.220
 days as they are today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.440
 topic that I would like more to talk about 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 from him we could put it into practice 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.859
 let's talk about sleeping and what's important 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.289
 what is the dream and suddenly there are some 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 that we think that if we take a nap or 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 we sleep other we are like losing the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 time is important or not important 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 dedicate time to sleep today is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.420
 our dear doctor Alejandro 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.019
 spinoza welcome 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.019
 we are still doing experiments 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 hey doctor what wave with the dream is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 important or not super important and super 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.720
 important is one of those processes in the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.880
 body that are irreplaceable 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.350
 just as one says I can not eat with 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.630
 a human being can not eat can not 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 drinking water can not breathe a being 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.190
 human can not sleep there are rare cases 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.590
 of people who have a concern 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.630
 of nervous system and do not sleep but 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.610
 are very rare things are cases that the 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.440
 truth is that they are from study 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.360
 experiments but really really 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.800
 we humans need 2000 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.620
 because a necessary process in which 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.310
 occurs a series of functions that 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.920
 shoot 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.080
 only especially during sleep 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.580
 like what happens when we sleep because 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.130
 in addition there are even nutritionists who 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.590
 they say that when we sleep we burn fat 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
 and that if you leave like this is the dream a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 moment in which the active body 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.270
 processes that normally are not 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.619
 running so much for example when one 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.479
 sleeps the electrical activity of 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.950
 Brain changes is not the same activity 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.210
 when you were awake you have 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 you need to be thinking like very 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.000
 focused but at night is when 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 connections occur ideally the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.229
 nerve connections that make us 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.610
 to think better to focus it better to have better 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.619
 memory so what we see during the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.690
 day a little result of what happened in 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.730
 the night 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.490
 then while the dream is the time 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.050
 enough and of sufficient quality better 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.060
 processing we have the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.920
 information the nervous system I do not know 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.940
 some of you have had one 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:13.540
 full full night full 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:15.310
 well because the 20 00 hour of the past but 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.600
 you also already is that suddenly we arrived 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.820
 to the grandstand in the morning and you come to 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.650
 work at 7 and it 's good that yes 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.470
 those and the next day as you said very 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.800
 bad really bad if this energy I feel 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800
 very bad 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.020
 if I did not sleep anything until 11 am I'm very 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:43.270
 finite but when they tell me already out the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.220
 program since when you have to 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.650
 come to the program the stress 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.060
 it's clear and the body gets where it does not 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.710
 has to work is a little 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.880
 more but I do not know if it happened to us by 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.040
 example is typical that the mind that does not 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.040
 sleeps the next day starts as bad 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.620
 because because muscles for example 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.689
 they rest during the night especially 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.250
 the visual muscles are if one is 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.659
 Focusing vision throughout the day 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.939
 especially if one is in the 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.579
 computer or reading or making a 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.379
 effort in particular and does not rest 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.319
 he pauses there comes a moment that he 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.139
 fatigue the muscle is not to say one can 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.730
 hold the arm does not have a serious weight 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.560
 that one can not hold a while but 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.849
 hold it for an hour just like that nobody 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.799
 can hold an arm an hour or nobody 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.620
 you can have it if the same thing happens with the 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.169
 eye muscles and they are constantly 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.480
 Focusing on activating changes 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.760
 of light fatigue if you have to rest 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.859
 because the musculature and not only 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.810
 Eye muscles in general 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.180
 renew and that is grace among others 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.159
 things to the famous growth hormone 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.019
 that if you have not seen that children 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.129
 when babies sleep with their Chiquito 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.079
 very much 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.810
 or pregnant women by pregnant women 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.700
 also for pregnant women need 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.889
 because they have to create a series of 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.180
 conditions so that the baby can go 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.549
 growing magical but 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.290
 in particular while you are sleeping 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.480
 when more production growth by 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.480
 They say that babies grow while 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.150
 they sleep that moment where the baby sleeps 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.099
 sleeps 14 hours 16 hours a day is a 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.750
 moment that is so important that a 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.430
 sometimes the growth rate stops 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.259
 for the child do not rest the time 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.910
 enough or of quality but and then 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.460
 why also when you are already having 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.090
 an age you stop sleeping and you start 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.350
 wake up at 6 in the morning because 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.300
 you have gone to bed late is very good 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.310
 question because they say the studies of 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.099
 dream that yes it is true that there is a 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.789
 tendency to decrease the amount of 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.590
 dream 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.330
 as age passes and a person 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.280
 of old people out there begin to 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.530
 sleep less hours but be careful not 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.630
 it means that they sleep as a minor 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.120
 quality the dream that's different a 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.680
 thing of 2000 - hours but the quality the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.199
 depth of sleep is important 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.810
 because just given the depth of 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.009
 sleep is what makes it shoot up in 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.840
 those mechanisms in bodies that a 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.639
 repairman is and what happens with the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.099
 menopause because there are also many 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.900
 women or andropause the men that 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.020
 when they reach that stage it costs them 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.539
 hard work falling asleep 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.340
 notice that part of the dream process 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.199
 It depends on the quality of the quantity of 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.629
 the hormones that it has in the climacteric 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.250
 which it is a long process after 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.599
 when they start alterations 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.220
 hormonal but especially after 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.389
 that women stop venturing what is it 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.900
 that is called menopause the last 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.580
 menstruation in that process usually 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.610
 What happens is that the woman 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.590
 sleeps and then at 2 3 4 the morning it 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.909
 wake up and that what he does is 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.949
 interrupt sleep what does it mean 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.870
 that the dream stops being deep leaves 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.479
 to be repairing and that's why the next day 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.819
 they are worse than malano the body is replenished 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.819
 and it 's a vicious circle because they say that 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.680
 the poison of the climacteric is stress and 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.150
 one of the things that a vicious circle 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.150
 is that the woman does not rest 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.889
 because if he sleeps he rejuvenates the children and 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.479
 it is clear that they are gone now it gets 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.130
 very fashionable people who do these 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.909
 things therapy before aging and everything 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.949
 that they are tried as a 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.440
 decrease human growth 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.520
 it has many benefits we do not 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.990
 I very much agree with that because 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.569
 out of time it can be a bit 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.300
 dangerous but it's true that when you 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.710
 they stop producing stress hormones 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.139
 which is one of the hormones that most 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.729
 generates the process or active process of 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.240
 aging mostly how it is released 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.800
 too much and then the immune system does not 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.569
 is over active then there is not so much 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.770
 inflammation there is not so much oxidation that 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.139
 one of the causes that appear more 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.909
 wrinkles that one is more tired than 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.189
 have less ability to focus if 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.110
 it's true that the dream we're going to 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.969
 people who sleep enough 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.369
 well have a good night's sleep and if you see 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.439
 younger and they look much more because they 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.539
 We just time but it is the same of 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.759
 I dream this night I sleep in a 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.369
 Little party has some effects for the 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.569
 most people if it's not the same 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.099
 look at the morning that night because no 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.020
 the same amount of hormones produced 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.759
 there is a hormonal cycle during the day that 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.039
 you have to respect but still who 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.749
 you need if you can have it put in a 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:07.319
 pause if you recover very well in about 7 

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:09.240
 appointment of a few minutes because he does not sleep 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.679
 what needs to be resolved is all clear 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.939
 become addicted to those pills and try 

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:13.740
 solve the reason why one does not 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.510
 sleep and for that good that look for us 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.160
 we'll see other ways 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.150
 but in a second part as a remedy 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.150
 to sleep but good 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.480
 our exact bedside doctor 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.460
 let's go marisol that i time 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.560
