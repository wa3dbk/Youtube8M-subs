00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.670
 Speak there, everyone, everyone who speaks is the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.740
 flip and in response to the request 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 mateus lopes i bring you game 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.640
 play the game raven's or two's cry 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.080
 reading 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.270
 He wanted to know if I was 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 working perfectly and matheus is 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 working perfectly without any 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.449
 interference of lay or gagging 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.920
 is the game features amazing graphics 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.690
 something very well done even then you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.149
 can see through the video itself the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.020
 realization of the image is very long and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.610
 I can see very far in this game if 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 in the real world would be one kilometer 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.300
 away as it is a game was not said 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 to the mixture 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.039
 how could I have told myself away but it is 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.710
 something very incredible is the game it a game 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 I picked it up a lot like god with 5 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.260
 that is the mockery is also because it is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 that even in the vision of the character you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
 chooses both third person when 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 first person you choose the point of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
 be better to select the movement of the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 The character's sword is also very 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 similar to sky 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.070
 I've heard comments say that this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 is the skype for android i believe not 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.409
 have nothing to do with each other's history 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.479
 it's also different 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 they may have based themselves in order to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.040
 make a really interesting game 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.040
 as the karen was signed here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 again the mob's dead items is 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.649
 quite interesting does not count with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 no lego in cattle on a motorcycle and of course 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.000
