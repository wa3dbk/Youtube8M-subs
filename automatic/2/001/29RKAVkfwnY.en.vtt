but about an inch and a half of water is

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.120 
but about an inch and a half of water is
sufficient<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.690> yes<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.410> can<00:03:32.680> cook<00:03:32.980> this

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
dish in your rice cooker but don't use

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.500 
dish in your rice cooker but don't use
one<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:35.980> those<00:03:36.190> microwave<00:03:36.819> rice<00:03:37.090> cookers

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
one of those microwave rice cookers

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.780 
one of those microwave rice cookers
because<00:03:37.840> it's<00:03:38.020> going<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.440> get<00:03:38.740> damaged<00:03:39.280> anyway

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
because it's going to get damaged anyway

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.089 
because it's going to get damaged anyway
back<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.300> recipe<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.500> dish<00:03:41.800> though

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
back to the recipe for this dish though

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.949 
back to the recipe for this dish though
you<00:03:42.489> will<00:03:42.640> use<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.270> bit<00:03:43.480> more<00:03:43.540> water

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
you will use a little bit more water

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
you will use a little bit more water
because<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.530> fish<00:03:44.770> will<00:03:44.980> soak<00:03:45.220> up<00:03:45.370> all<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
because the fish will soak up all of the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.240 
because the fish will soak up all of the
fluids<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.840> basically<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.560> means<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:48.040> little

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
fluids so basically that means a little

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.460 
fluids so basically that means a little
more<00:03:48.430> than<00:03:48.760> an<00:03:48.849> inch<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.360> half<00:03:49.390> now<00:03:49.989> add<00:03:50.230> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
more than an inch and a half now add the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.470 
more than an inch and a half now add the
