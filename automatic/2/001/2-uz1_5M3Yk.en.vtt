00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 the procedure of the written 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
 You can apply multiplication by two 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.440
 multiply numbers 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 I show that other task 54 times 362 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.119
 the numbers of the task become 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.220
 neatly in the individual boxes 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 divorced 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.000
 a dash under it during the task 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.000
 of the inter resultat 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.000
 we start with one of the first 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.730
 factor the four we multiply with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.350
 the 24 times two are 8 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 the result is noted 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:04.379
 next is the lot with the 16er 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 multiplied 24 are now writing one 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:14.220
 the unit of the result him so the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.710
 four and keep the 2 in mind or if 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.330
 This may also be necessary with the fingers 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.000
 to be stretched or recorded 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.360
 the same process is performed with the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.909
 in the hundreds digit 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:40.729
 four times three are 12 to come 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.729
 two makes four toes write 4 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.550
 and if no further bill takes place 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.550
 can also be noted the same 1 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.160
 Now we come to 10 of the first factor 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.130
 to take that into account , we move forward 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:09.479
 here a place to the left and let 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:14.410
 the one place five times two gives c 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:21.790
 I write a 0 claimed that once 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:27.400
 in the head as I said in the 456 are 30plus 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:33.060
 the 131 writes it up once and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.780
 keep the three in your head five times three 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.150
 are 15 + 3 gives 18 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.740
 this agent did the same 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.740
 be completely written down 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.220
 Further we will use the method in the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:05.870
 written tradition and count 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:05.870
 the two intermediate results together with 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:24.120
 80 plus 4 1 plus 4 58 percent on this 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.140
 wisely we get the result of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.140
 task 54 times 362
