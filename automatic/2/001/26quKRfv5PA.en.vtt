things like that and this guy has some
similar<00:00:38.720> issues<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:39.350> he's<00:00:39.440> not<00:00:39.590> nearly<00:00:39.830> as

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.920 
bad as I thought he was going to be so
I'm<00:00:42.680> not<00:00:42.800> not<00:00:43.130> too<00:00:43.340> happy<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:44.210> mean<00:00:44.510> I'm<00:00:44.600> not<00:00:44.690> too

standard<00:00:56.090> DC<00:00:56.450> you<00:00:56.600> see<00:00:56.840> but<00:00:57.079> maybe<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.469> quite

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
standard DC you see but maybe not quite

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.799 
standard DC you see but maybe not quite
as<00:00:57.980> big<00:00:58.250> as<00:00:58.430> Darkseid<00:00:58.700> should<00:00:59.090> be<00:00:59.239> I<00:00:59.420> don't

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
as big as Darkseid should be I don't

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.900 
as big as Darkseid should be I don't
know<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.050> haven't<00:01:00.350> heard<00:01:00.920> anything<00:01:01.250> about<00:01:01.520> him

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
know I haven't heard anything about him

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.240 
know I haven't heard anything about him
in<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.120> comics<00:01:02.570> in<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.110> version<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.800> him<00:01:04.070> I

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
in the comics in this version of him I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.880 
in the comics in this version of him I
know<00:01:04.990> originally<00:01:05.990> he<00:01:06.170> liked<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.560> regular

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
know originally he liked the regular

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.889 
know originally he liked the regular
dark<00:01:07.130> side<00:01:07.399> before<00:01:07.550> new<00:01:07.850> 52<00:01:08.149> he<00:01:08.600> was<00:01:08.720> supposed

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
dark side before new 52 he was supposed

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.779 
dark side before new 52 he was supposed
to<00:01:08.960> be<00:01:09.080> kind<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.350> big<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.130> maybe<00:01:10.220> they<00:01:10.520> shrunk

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
to be kind of big so maybe they shrunk

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.130 
to be kind of big so maybe they shrunk
them<00:01:10.880> down<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.060> little<00:01:11.300> bit<00:01:11.479> maybe<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.930> toys

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
them down a little bit maybe the toys

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.380 
them down a little bit maybe the toys
just<00:01:12.440> not<00:01:12.619> quite<00:01:12.860> as<00:01:12.920> big<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:13.549> seven<00:01:14.119> inches

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
just not quite as big but seven inches

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.410 
just not quite as big but seven inches
is<00:01:14.570> probably<00:01:15.020> big<00:01:15.229> enough<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.979> get<00:01:16.130> by<00:01:16.420> sculpt

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
is probably big enough to get by sculpt

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420 
is probably big enough to get by sculpt

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
don't know how much of him is reused

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.820 
don't know how much of him is reused
from<00:01:31.880> ammo<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.390> figure<00:01:32.810> because<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:33.680> don't

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
from ammo to figure because I don't

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.010 
from ammo to figure because I don't
collect<00:01:34.100> those<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:34.970> either<00:01:35.270> way<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.720> suits

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
collect those but either way it suits

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.020 
collect those but either way it suits
him<00:01:36.200> pretty<00:01:36.409> well<00:01:36.549> as<00:01:37.549> far<00:01:37.759> as<00:01:37.909> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
him pretty well as far as the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.690 
him pretty well as far as the
proportions<00:01:38.540> go<00:01:38.840> like<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:39.920> said<00:01:39.979> Batman<00:01:40.400> had

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
proportions go like I said Batman had

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100 
proportions go like I said Batman had
small<00:01:41.030> hands<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.450> guy's<00:01:41.630> hands<00:01:41.930> are<00:01:42.079> a

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
small hands this guy's hands are a

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.770 
small hands this guy's hands are a
little<00:01:42.200> bit<00:01:42.530> big<00:01:42.829> I<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.310> especially<00:01:44.240> this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
little bit big I think especially this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.270 
little bit big I think especially this
one<00:01:45.049> but<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.470> looks<00:01:45.590> like<00:01:45.650> both<00:01:45.890> hands<00:01:46.159> are

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
one but it looks like both hands are

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.340 
one but it looks like both hands are
probably<00:01:46.579> too<00:01:46.700> big<00:01:46.909> for<00:01:47.180> him<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:48.110> head

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
probably too big for him and the head

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.050 
probably too big for him and the head
though<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.710> looks<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.250> too<00:01:49.460> big<00:01:49.490> at

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
though it looks like it's too big at

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090 
though it looks like it's too big at
first<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.689> don't<00:01:51.140> think<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.409> heads<00:01:51.619> really<00:01:51.770> all

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
first I don't think the heads really all

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
first I don't think the heads really all
that<00:01:52.399> much<00:01:52.610> too<00:01:52.850> big<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> way<00:01:53.689> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
that much too big it's just the way the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.810 
that much too big it's just the way the
shoulder<00:01:54.170> pads<00:01:54.439> are<00:01:54.680> made<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:55.369> makes<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
shoulder pads are made it makes the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850 
shoulder pads are made it makes the
whole<00:01:56.030> upper<00:01:56.570> body<00:01:56.600> look<00:01:57.079> too<00:01:57.290> big<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:57.710> they

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
whole upper body look too big if they

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.929 
whole upper body look too big if they
were<00:01:57.920> not<00:01:58.640> quite<00:01:59.149> as<00:01:59.420> bulky<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:01.520> doing<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
were not quite as bulky just doing that

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.789 
were not quite as bulky just doing that
I<00:02:01.970> think<00:02:02.149> makes<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.810> world<00:02:03.079> of<00:02:03.350> difference<00:02:03.680> in

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
I think makes a world of difference in

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.170 
I think makes a world of difference in
the<00:02:03.890> look<00:02:04.040> of<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.189> figure<00:02:04.549> just<00:02:04.759> pull<00:02:05.000> them

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
the look of the figure just pull them

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.999 
the look of the figure just pull them
down<00:02:05.210> back<00:02:05.659> a<00:02:05.689> little<00:02:05.960> bit<00:02:06.200> but<00:02:06.680> having<00:02:06.920> them

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
down back a little bit but having them

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.520 
down back a little bit but having them
puff<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.909> like<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:09.019> some<00:02:09.259> kind<00:02:09.470> of

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
puff up like this like like some kind of

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.710 
puff up like this like like some kind of
beetle<00:02:09.860> wings<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.399> don't<00:02:10.850> know<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.269> throws

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
beetle wings I don't know it just throws

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.210 
beetle wings I don't know it just throws
off<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.079> proportion<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.739> actually<00:02:12.920> not

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
off the proportion so it's actually not

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.280 
off the proportion so it's actually not
so<00:02:13.459> bad<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.269> just<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.600> hands<00:02:14.840> are<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.049> little

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so bad it's just the hands are a little

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.130 
so bad it's just the hands are a little
bit<00:02:15.410> too<00:02:15.590> big<00:02:15.860> otherwise<00:02:16.310> he's<00:02:16.549> okay

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
bit too big otherwise he's okay

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
bit too big otherwise he's okay
paint<00:02:18.140> work<00:02:18.290> throughout<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.770> figure<00:02:19.040> is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
paint work throughout the figure is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.040 
paint work throughout the figure is
pretty<00:02:19.489> good<00:02:19.700> there's<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.360> little<00:02:20.569> shading<00:02:20.840> on

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
pretty good there's a little shading on

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.510 
pretty good there's a little shading on
this<00:02:21.230> red<00:02:21.470> part<00:02:21.709> here

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
this red part here

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.000 
this red part here
goldish<00:02:23.060> bronze<00:02:23.390> color<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:24.020> nicely<00:02:24.320> done<00:02:24.710> just

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
goldish bronze color is nicely done just

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.430 
goldish bronze color is nicely done just
about<00:02:25.190> everywhere<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.660> looks<00:02:26.870> really<00:02:27.230> good<00:02:27.380> I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
about everywhere it looks really good I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.080 
about everywhere it looks really good I
think<00:02:27.920> they're<00:02:28.100> shading<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> shoulder

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
think they're shading in the shoulder

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.110 
think they're shading in the shoulder
pads<00:02:29.360> all<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.350> texture<00:02:31.280> painting<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
pads all the texture painting in the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.820 
pads all the texture painting in the
face<00:02:32.360> looks<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:33.080> good<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.440> eyes<00:02:33.560> are

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
face looks really good the eyes are

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.380 
face looks really good the eyes are
painted<00:02:34.160> well<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> teeth<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:34.880> painted<00:02:35.210> well

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
painted well the teeth are painted well

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.290 
painted well the teeth are painted well
the<00:02:36.050> blue<00:02:36.260> lines<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.980> legs<00:02:37.220> are<00:02:37.550> done<00:02:38.000> well

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
the blue lines on the legs are done well

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.150 
the blue lines on the legs are done well
enough<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.470> there's<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:39.740> not<00:02:39.980> much<00:02:40.100> to

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
enough so there's really not much to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.890 
enough so there's really not much to
complain<00:02:40.280> about<00:02:40.550> as<00:02:40.820> far<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.090> paint<00:02:41.360> or<00:02:41.540> sculpt

complain about as far as paint or sculpt

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.630 
complain about as far as paint or sculpt
goes<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.350> just<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.650> proportions<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.370> little

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
goes it's just the proportions a little

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.300 
goes it's just the proportions a little
bit<00:02:43.790> off<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.480> far<00:02:44.660> as<00:02:44.750> articulation<00:02:45.470> goes<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
bit off as far as articulation goes the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.180 
bit off as far as articulation goes the
head<00:02:46.550> has<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.510> ball<00:02:47.840> peg<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.500> goes<00:02:48.680> forward

head has a ball peg that goes forward

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.400 
head has a ball peg that goes forward
and<00:02:49.340> backward<00:02:49.760> but<00:02:50.390> as<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.690> can<00:02:50.810> see<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.260> way

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
and backward but as you can see the way

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.840 
and backward but as you can see the way
it's<00:02:51.590> built<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.130> doesn't<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.520> give<00:02:52.760> you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
it's built it doesn't really give you

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.210 
it's built it doesn't really give you
any<00:02:52.880> range<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.420> motion<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.140> once<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> heads

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
any range of motion so once the heads

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.090 
any range of motion so once the heads
put<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.390> can't<00:02:56.720> get<00:02:57.290> much<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.890> the

put on you can't get much out of the

into<00:03:00.140> place<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.740> most<00:03:00.890> part<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.850> moves

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
into place for the most part it moves

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.880 
into place for the most part it moves
just<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.450> tiny<00:03:02.660> little<00:03:02.930> bit<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.770> have

you<00:03:28.730> essentially<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:30.110> ball<00:03:30.290> hinge

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
you essentially have it's a ball hinge

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.410 
you essentially have it's a ball hinge
so<00:03:30.860> it's<00:03:31.040> forward<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:31.670> backward<00:03:32.000> side<00:03:32.270> to

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
so it's forward and backward side to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420 
so it's forward and backward side to
side<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.959> a<00:03:33.380> thigh<00:03:33.560> swivel<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.160> this<00:03:34.310> is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
side and a thigh swivel so this is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.460 
side and a thigh swivel so this is
actually<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.790> better<00:03:34.940> hip<00:03:35.270> design<00:03:35.690> than<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.290> DC

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
actually a better hip design than the DC

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.980 
actually a better hip design than the DC
you<00:03:36.800> see<00:03:37.040> Figures<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.240> I<00:03:38.270> kind<00:03:38.570> of<00:03:38.630> hope<00:03:38.810> that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
you see Figures so I kind of hope that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.470 
you see Figures so I kind of hope that
they<00:03:39.200> start<00:03:39.560> using<00:03:39.980> these<00:03:40.220> for<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.550> other<00:03:41.000> DC

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
they start using these for the other DC

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.090 
they start using these for the other DC
figures<00:03:41.840> rather<00:03:42.110> than<00:03:42.320> just<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.680> ones<00:03:42.830> on<00:03:43.010> the

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
figures rather than just the ones on the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.949 
figures rather than just the ones on the
motor<00:03:43.430> bodies<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.940> would<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.090> really<00:03:44.450> nice<00:03:44.600> I

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
motor bodies that would be really nice I

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.770 
motor bodies that would be really nice I
don't<00:03:45.350> think<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:45.709> gonna<00:03:45.800> happen<00:03:46.040> though

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
don't think it's gonna happen though

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.870 
don't think it's gonna happen though
single<00:03:47.780> jointed<00:03:48.080> knee<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:49.070> single<00:03:49.400> jointed

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
single jointed knee and a single jointed

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.090 
single jointed knee and a single jointed
ankle<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.660> don't<00:03:51.110> think<00:03:51.410> yeah<00:03:51.709> there<00:03:51.980> is

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
ankle I don't think yeah there is

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.530 
ankle I don't think yeah there is
actually<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.730> an<00:03:52.820> ankle<00:03:53.060> rocker<00:03:53.300> on

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
actually there is an ankle rocker on

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.080 
actually there is an ankle rocker on
this<00:03:53.690> guy<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.230> little<00:03:54.470> bit<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.090> pretty

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
this guy just a little bit so pretty

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.310 
this guy just a little bit so pretty
good<00:03:56.270> figure<00:03:56.510> overall<00:03:56.840> guys<00:03:56.990> it's<00:03:57.200> not

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
good figure overall guys it's not

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.440 
good figure overall guys it's not
perfect<00:03:57.800> but<00:03:58.400> if<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:58.910> dark<00:03:59.209> side<00:03:59.420> or

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
perfect but if you like dark side or

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.290 
perfect but if you like dark side or
Superman<00:04:00.140> or<00:04:00.490> DC<00:04:01.490> figures<00:04:01.910> or<00:04:02.060> mode<00:04:02.180> to

figures<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.840> should<00:04:02.870> probably<00:04:03.170> pick<00:04:03.350> this

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
figures you should probably pick this

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.290 
figures you should probably pick this
guy<00:04:03.680> up<00:04:03.709> he's<00:04:04.040> pretty<00:04:04.070> cool<00:04:04.490> he's<00:04:04.820> not<00:04:05.000> nearly

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
guy up he's pretty cool he's not nearly

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.210 
guy up he's pretty cool he's not nearly
as<00:04:05.450> bad<00:04:05.570> as<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.810> thought<00:04:06.080> he<00:04:06.290> was<00:04:06.440> gonna<00:04:06.560> be<00:04:06.800> and

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
as bad as I thought he was gonna be and

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.460 
as bad as I thought he was gonna be and
having<00:04:07.550> him<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.910> hand<00:04:08.240> makes<00:04:08.959> him<00:04:09.140> even<00:04:09.350> that

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
having him in hand makes him even that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.990 
having him in hand makes him even that
much<00:04:09.620> better<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.280> go<00:04:10.310> ahead<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:10.670> pick<00:04:10.790> him<00:04:10.940> up

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
much better so go ahead and pick him up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.350 
much better so go ahead and pick him up
if<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:12.350> any<00:04:12.530> inkling<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.120> it's

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
if you have any inkling to do so it's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.940 
if you have any inkling to do so it's
not<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.510> bad<00:04:14.720> figure<00:04:15.050> it's<00:04:15.200> not<00:04:15.230> nearly<00:04:15.560> as<00:04:15.709> bad

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
not a bad figure it's not nearly as bad

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.280 
not a bad figure it's not nearly as bad
as<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.609> might<00:04:16.910> have<00:04:17.090> thought<00:04:17.200> thanks<00:04:18.200> for
