00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
23 well in high school and I played with

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.520 
23 well in high school and I played with
my<00:02:57.740> brother<00:02:58.150> my<00:02:59.150> favorite<00:02:59.510> number<00:02:59.720> was<00:02:59.870> 45<00:03:00.320> and

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
my brother my favorite number was 45 and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.250 
my brother my favorite number was 45 and
his<00:03:01.280> favorite<00:03:01.610> number<00:03:01.730> 45<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:02.990> we<00:03:03.080> were<00:03:03.200> on

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
his favorite number 45 but we were on

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.100 
his favorite number 45 but we were on
the<00:03:03.350> same<00:03:03.500> teams<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.700> he<00:03:05.270> had<00:03:05.420> seniority<00:03:05.630> he

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
the same teams so he had seniority he

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.880 
the same teams so he had seniority he
had<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.980> option<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.490> we're<00:03:07.700> 45<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.480> just

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
had the option that we're 45 so I just

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.890 
had the option that we're 45 so I just
figured<00:03:09.890> 23<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.610> half<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.940> 45<00:03:11.330> 22<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> half

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
figured 23 was half of 45 22 and a half

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.160 
figured 23 was half of 45 22 and a half
so<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.200> got<00:03:12.530> grabbed<00:03:12.860> 23<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.780> 23<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:14.989> kind<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
so I got grabbed 23 and 23 it's kind of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.990 
so I got grabbed 23 and 23 it's kind of
stuck<00:03:15.380> with<00:03:15.530> me<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.739> whole<00:03:15.800> time<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.310> went<00:03:16.910> back
