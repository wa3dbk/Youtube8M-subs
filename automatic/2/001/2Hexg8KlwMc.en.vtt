00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 in Italy meat is eaten but in reality 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.980
 here no no but yes good good pasta 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.349
 pizza and salad also the one that looks 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.590
 richest Argentina I always like 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.100
 much the argentine also 30 minutes in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.100
 the contest 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.199
 Brazil and the number 1 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.340
 to export within our 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.340
 exports 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 dale let's make a little tail 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 but we 're going to do it very differently than 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.840
 always because of the tail of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.520
 cuadril is a fairly debated cut not 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 that improves the grill not that better 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.629
 oven turns out to be for me it's a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.340
 cut that generally remains a bit dry 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.199
 inside then this is invented from the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 tail wick but we are always with 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 the plums with the tummy what 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 we make so that the tail does not remain dry 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.549
 we go 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.190
 filling easy easy listening on onion 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.220
 chopped and sautÃ©ed processed if you want 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 extended previously cooked cheese 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.290
 grated if a lot of grated cheese is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.290
 understand let's put 2 eggs 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.810
 Mommy already left the recipe is that she 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.810
 won the eggs contest 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.670
 2 eggs salt pepper we are going to put 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 bread crumb that bread bread lactal 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.149
 that we show her many times of spades 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 bread crumb lactal bread and we're going 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.670
 to put mexico also missed the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.679
 melted butter butter is all 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.539
 this looks what I mix I mix it I mix it 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.759
 The last thing we are going to put is 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.759
 parsley quickly there is good 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.290
 well I'm telling you back to the eggs 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.080
 grated bread or lactal bread crumb bread 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.180
 carrot parsley that more than salt 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.180
 pepper a little mustard 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.620
 you do not remember everything that was 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.940
 well I put it in here if I criticized 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.520
 in a bank quickly I come 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.770
 for here a little bit of this mixture 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.180
 of this mixture if you do not have the sleeve what 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.600
 you can make directly with spoon 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 how to make the cut in the queue to be able to 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.760
 come in with this and good is the way in 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.430
 reality that this looks good and does not 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.230
 exit from the sides but walls 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.240
 put double sense brother no it is not 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.240
 double meaning is not a cut look 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.240
 surgeon 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.490
 thoroughly but what happens one side and for the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.590
 another do not pass because it is going to leave the 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.770
 fill the next thing you're going to do with 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.100
 so you're going to make the hole for 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.720
 that after all the filling what 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.910
 it's going to fill in, you're not going to help 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.510
 fill the tail come and then cut 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.230
 the scissors in the sleeve here inside that 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.820
 you have to press like this 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.860
 the channels and cillian were filled 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.580
 clear it's a bit like a channel and of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.110
 meat is pressed hard and they walk 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.110
 looking for the back of the flesh is 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.890
 tremendous 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.610
 but look, you see how the flesh grew 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.820
 this just means that no 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.940
 you need more exploded from this list 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.050
 so what do we do two or three toothpicks 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.830
 quickly it is very well a provision 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.890
 for her because she is doing very well very well 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.410
 but the pig and here we have a pan 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.450
 which is already hot round and round and 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.780
 after it is well browned this is 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.780
 goes to the oven 45 minutes rodrigo calm 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.480
 colom continue on how to weigh almost 2 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.870
 kilos 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.800
 here I simply have if I have a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.400
 symptom of here look 123 456 potatoes is 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.380
 simply in Cuba 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.050
 if the cut chiquitita does not need 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.090
 to serve her is simply to know had the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.220
 idea just add a little bacon 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.229
 although the heat and the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.990
 summer I think this little tail of 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.410
 cuadril deserved a rich garnish 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.910
 classic you want to see what is made 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.259
 good as I do not just want to show 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.720
 to people how it browns while 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.550
 josefina pulls out the meat see how it goes 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 worshiping was flying over quiet in your 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.130
 home then you put it on a plate and 30 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.979
 quiet minutes with 30 minutes is 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.930
 enough I come here 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.910
 bring me the plate and we are going to cut the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.570
 tail because everyone is intrigued by 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.570
 see how it was 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.229
 that role again 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.150
 it is tremendous 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.860
 it's tremendous says that this diet and it 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.889
