by<00:01:47.600> International<00:01:48.350> Harvester<00:01:48.530> which<00:01:49.490> was

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
by International Harvester which was

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.060 
by International Harvester which was
just<00:01:49.910> loved<00:01:50.300> by<00:01:50.540> all<00:01:50.690> came<00:01:51.350> out<00:01:51.500> originally<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
just loved by all came out originally is

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.330 
just loved by all came out originally is
an<00:01:52.190> H<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.610> then<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.330> model<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.810> super<00:01:54.170> H

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
an H and then in this model is super H

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.740 
an H and then in this model is super H
super<00:01:55.340> H<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.670> had<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.909> little<00:01:56.180> bit<00:01:56.330> more<00:01:56.360> power

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
super H just had a little bit more power

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.010 
super H just had a little bit more power
on<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.230> a<00:01:57.440> little<00:01:58.010> bit<00:01:58.250> more<00:01:58.880> gustl<00:01:59.480> and<00:01:59.630> engine

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
on it a little bit more gustl and engine

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.120 
on it a little bit more gustl and engine
so<00:02:00.230> speed<00:02:01.090> four-cylinder<00:02:02.090> engine<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.920> as<00:02:03.920> you

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
so speed four-cylinder engine and as you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.680 
so speed four-cylinder engine and as you
can<00:02:04.250> see<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.729> still<00:02:04.940> run<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.330> still<00:02:05.540> doing

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
can see it's still run and still doing

can see it's still run and still doing
well<00:02:05.930> my<00:02:06.470> brother's<00:02:06.770> going<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.950> jump<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.400> it

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
well my brother's going to jump on it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.279 
well my brother's going to jump on it
here<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:07.850> as<00:02:07.970> he<00:02:08.149> pushes<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.750> brake<00:02:09.019> there

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
here and as he pushes on the brake there

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.589 
here and as he pushes on the brake there
on<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.590> left<00:02:09.830> tire<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:11.120> almost<00:02:11.420> turn

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
on that left tire I can almost turn

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.600 
on that left tire I can almost turn
around<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.050> complete<00:02:12.170> circle<00:02:12.650> he's<00:02:13.459> going

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
around in a complete circle he's going

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.940 
around in a complete circle he's going
to<00:02:13.700> take<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.769> can<00:02:15.889> hear

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
to take it out there and as you can hear

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.099 
to take it out there and as you can hear
it<00:02:16.219> running<00:02:16.510> I'm<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.689> to<00:02:17.749> take<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.079> a

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
it running I'm going to take it for a

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.300 
it running I'm going to take it for a
little<00:02:18.290> Drive<00:02:18.499> then<00:02:18.769> you'll<00:02:18.859> come<00:02:19.069> back<00:02:19.099> in

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
little Drive then you'll come back in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
little Drive then you'll come back in
and<00:02:19.700> we'll<00:02:19.819> swing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and we'll swing

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.630 
and we'll swing
around<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.890> kind<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.129> see<00:02:21.280> how<00:02:21.400> easy

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
around so you can kind of see how easy

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.119 
around so you can kind of see how easy
it<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.940> turn<00:02:22.360> these<00:02:22.569> trikes<00:02:22.930> these<00:02:23.830> trikes

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
it is turn these trikes these trikes

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.460 
it is turn these trikes these trikes
just<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.700> mean<00:02:25.180> they're<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.840> great<00:02:26.140> for

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
just I mean they're just great for

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.140 
just I mean they're just great for
moving<00:02:26.860> stuff<00:02:27.220> around<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.670> farm<00:02:27.910> I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
moving stuff around the farm I

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.229 
moving stuff around the farm I
particularly<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:29.620> moving<00:02:29.940> our<00:02:30.940> boat

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
particularly like it for moving our boat

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.479 
particularly like it for moving our boat
bale<00:02:31.959> wagons<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.620> some<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> smaller

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
bale wagons and some of the smaller

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.940 
bale wagons and some of the smaller
equipment<00:02:34.209> around<00:02:34.470> tractor<00:02:35.470> itself<00:02:35.769> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
equipment around tractor itself is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.850 
equipment around tractor itself is
fairly<00:02:36.160> heavy<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.970> ranges<00:02:37.360> from<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:37.860> 3,800

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
fairly heavy it ranges from about 3,800

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
fairly heavy it ranges from about 3,800
pounds<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> 6,000<00:02:40.060> pounds<00:02:40.390> playing<00:02:40.690> upon

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
pounds up to 6,000 pounds playing upon

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.360 
pounds up to 6,000 pounds playing upon
whether<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.349> had<00:02:41.530> wheel<00:02:41.769> weights<00:02:42.010> or<00:02:42.220> not

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
whether they had wheel weights or not

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.470 
whether they had wheel weights or not
put<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.930> can<00:02:44.080> take<00:02:44.260> quite<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.069> bit<00:02:45.280> of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
put on it so it can take quite a bit of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.449 
put on it so it can take quite a bit of
weight<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.780> its<00:02:46.989> drawbar<00:02:47.470> -<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.769> believe<00:02:48.280> it's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
weight on its drawbar - I believe it's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.630 
weight on its drawbar - I believe it's
close<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> 4000<00:02:50.200> pound<00:02:50.440> pull<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.340> easy

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
close to like a 4000 pound pull so easy

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.100 
close to like a 4000 pound pull so easy
you<00:02:51.819> can<00:02:51.879> turn<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.269> thing<00:02:52.480> around<00:02:52.540> just<00:02:52.989> by

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
you can turn that thing around just by

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.490 
you can turn that thing around just by
hitting<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.440> brake<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.549> inside<00:02:55.209> wheel

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
hitting the brake on the inside wheel

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.530 
hitting the brake on the inside wheel
that's<00:02:56.500> fantastic<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.370> being<00:02:57.760> maneuverable

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
that's fantastic for being maneuverable

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's fantastic for being maneuverable
and<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> tractor<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.250> heavy<00:03:00.489> and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
and because the tractor is so heavy and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000 
and because the tractor is so heavy and
it's<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.880> wide<00:03:01.060> stance<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:02.380> really<00:03:02.769> not<00:03:02.950> a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's a wide stance it's really not a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's a wide stance it's really not a
very<00:03:03.310> typical<00:03:03.579> tractor<00:03:04.440> fantastic<00:03:05.440> to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
very typical tractor fantastic to

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920 
very typical tractor fantastic to
operate<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.519> has<00:03:06.730> no<00:03:06.910> power<00:03:07.180> steering<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.840> as

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
operate it has no power steering but as

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.839 
operate it has no power steering but as
you<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.349> he's<00:03:08.620> one<00:03:08.920> arm<00:03:09.099> turning<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.640> it's

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
you can see he's one arm turning it it's

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.449 
you can see he's one arm turning it it's
that<00:03:10.150> easy<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.720> operate<00:03:10.890> we'll<00:03:11.890> let<00:03:12.040> him<00:03:12.220> get

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
that easy to operate we'll let him get

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.640 
that easy to operate we'll let him get
off<00:03:12.489> here<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.150> I'll<00:03:13.660> jump<00:03:13.930> on<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.349> and<00:03:14.470> we'll

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
off here and I'll jump on it and we'll

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.770 
off here and I'll jump on it and we'll
take<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:14.950> for<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.160> spin<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.670> we'll<00:03:16.329> put<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.660> in

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
take it for a spin and we'll put it in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.420 
take it for a spin and we'll put it in
the<00:03:16.900> fifth<00:03:17.110> year<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.500> we'll<00:03:17.620> open<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.950> up<00:03:18.099> and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
the fifth year and we'll open it up and

actually which is good around here we
use<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.989> for<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> lot<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.470> bailing

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
use it for a lot of bailing

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.300 
use it for a lot of bailing
use<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:45.970> raking<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.079> cutting<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:48.160> a
