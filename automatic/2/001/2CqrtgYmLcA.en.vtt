00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
this time we are going through Elom

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240 
this time we are going through Elom
which<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.870> my<00:00:10.080> build<00:00:10.349> submission<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.920> i<00:00:10.950> sent

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
which is my build submission that i sent

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.890 
which is my build submission that i sent
in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> while<00:00:11.550> ago<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.910> has<00:00:12.059> since<00:00:12.360> been<00:00:12.509> added

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
in a while ago and has since been added

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.230 
in a while ago and has since been added
into<00:00:13.080> mine<00:00:13.530> z<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.429> may<00:00:14.519> notice<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> little

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
into mine z you may notice it's a little

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
into mine z you may notice it's a little
different<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> not<00:00:16.170> covered<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.619> trees<00:00:16.890> but

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
different it is not covered in trees but

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880 
different it is not covered in trees but
instead<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.199> canyons<00:00:19.800> near

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
instead it is in the canyons near

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400 
instead it is in the canyons near
al-hasa<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.990> actually<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.109> two<00:00:22.320> hundred

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
al-hasa and actually it's two hundred

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
al-hasa and actually it's two hundred
blocks<00:00:22.740> east<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.130> campus<00:00:23.369> ara<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
blocks east of campus ara so the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.990 
blocks east of campus ara so the
coordinates<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.430> X<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.849> going

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
coordinates to this are the X is going

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
coordinates to this are the X is going
to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> about<00:00:27.539> let's<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.500> entrance<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to be about let's go to the entrance and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.230 
to be about let's go to the entrance and
get<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> exact<00:00:29.609> coordinates<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
get the exact coordinates to the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.179 
get the exact coordinates to the
entrance<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> city<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.009> easily

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
entrance of the city or you can easily

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.910 
entrance of the city or you can easily
get<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.780> entrance<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.770> at

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
get in so the entrance is going to be at

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.479 
get in so the entrance is going to be at
1685<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.110> about<00:00:37.489> let's

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
1685 and it's going to be at about let's

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.150 
1685 and it's going to be at about let's
say<00:00:38.579> negative<00:00:39.270> 20<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> 50<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> Z<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
say negative 20 to 50 for the Z and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
say negative 20 to 50 for the Z and
you're<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.390> ways<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you're going to get up the same ways you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.350 
you're going to get up the same ways you
normally<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> path<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:44.910> obstructed

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
normally would the path is an obstructed

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
normally would the path is an obstructed
by<00:00:45.420> trees<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.050> easily<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.649> how<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
by trees so you can easily see how to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.110 
by trees so you can easily see how to
get<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> could<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> different

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get up or you could take a different

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
get up or you could take a different
route<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
route up you're going to go up the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
route up you're going to go up the
ladders<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> stairs<00:00:51.120> sorry<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.440> don't

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
ladders are the stairs sorry and I don't

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
ladders are the stairs sorry and I don't
know<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> doing<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.370> remove<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
know what this is doing here remove that

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.220

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that's one of the main things you need

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.340 
that's one of the main things you need
to<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.170> city

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
to look out for when you're in this city

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
there are holes all throughout these

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
there are holes all throughout these
bridges<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.630> make<00:01:34.380> sure<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.610> watch<00:01:35.850> your

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bridges so make sure that you watch your
