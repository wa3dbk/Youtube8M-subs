we're<00:00:05.580> gonna<00:00:05.669> make<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> PEM<00:00:06.180> Yulin<00:00:06.450> system

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
we're gonna make a PEM Yulin system

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.570 
we're gonna make a PEM Yulin system
first<00:00:07.080> we'll<00:00:07.290> make<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.519> hemulen<00:00:08.519> gel<00:00:08.879> ph<00:00:09.570> 6.5

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
first we'll make the hemulen gel ph 6.5

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.599 
first we'll make the hemulen gel ph 6.5
with<00:00:11.580> citrate<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:13.199> it<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.590> then<00:00:14.309> we'll<00:00:14.459> make

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:14.609 
with citrate in it and then we'll make

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.849 
with citrate in it and then we'll make
an<00:00:14.789> emulsion<00:00:15.090> a<00:00:15.299> conventional<00:00:15.840> emulsion<00:00:16.320> into

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
an emulsion a conventional emulsion into

the PEM Yulin with shelfs LD 38 the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.739 
the PEM Yulin with shelfs LD 38 the
first<00:00:20.789> step<00:00:20.999> is<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.300> make<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.449> aqueous

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:21.749 
first step is to make the aqueous

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.609 
first step is to make the aqueous
dispersion<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> PEM<00:00:23.099> Yulin<00:00:24.619> with

whatever<00:00:26.039> modifications<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.329> we<00:00:28.050> use<00:00:28.169> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
whatever modifications we want we use a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:40.729 
whatever modifications we want we use a
5<00:00:28.499> milliliter<00:00:29.210> spoon

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.370 

and<00:00:42.120> transfer<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.210> into<00:00:43.420> our<00:00:43.570> little<00:00:43.870> mixing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
and transfer that into our little mixing

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.400 
and transfer that into our little mixing
jar<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.350> hemulen<00:00:47.829> is<00:00:48.239> made<00:00:49.239> at<00:00:49.390> 2%<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.170> stock

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
jar the hemulen is made at 2% the stock

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.520 
jar the hemulen is made at 2% the stock
gel<00:00:50.650> is<00:00:50.770> made<00:00:50.800> at<00:00:51.070> 2%<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:53.020> want<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.290> use<00:00:53.410> it

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
gel is made at 2% and we want to use it

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.010 
gel is made at 2% and we want to use it
at<00:00:53.620> 1%<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.430> it's<00:00:54.579> been<00:00:54.760> set<00:00:55.270> up<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:55.629> that<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.870> can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
at 1% so it's been set up so that we can

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.040 
at 1% so it's been set up so that we can
use<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.710> mCP<00:00:57.160> components<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.330> add

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
use it with the mCP components to add

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.200 
use it with the mCP components to add
additional<00:00:59.949> components<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.640> then<00:01:00.790> have<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
additional components and then have the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.450 
additional components and then have the
correct<00:01:01.510> final<00:01:02.079> percentage<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.159> we're<00:01:03.339> going

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
correct final percentage so we're going

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.219 
correct final percentage so we're going
to<00:01:03.519> use<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.730> 6.5<00:01:04.570> citrate<00:01:05.320> system<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:07.229> we'll

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
to use a 6.5 citrate system and we'll

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:16.050 
to use a 6.5 citrate system and we'll
use<00:01:08.259> 2<00:01:08.710> mils<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:09.220> that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.320 

and<00:01:17.380> then<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.740> make<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.190> balance<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.880> five

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
and then to make the balance of the five

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.740 
and then to make the balance of the five
mils<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.870> water<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.740> five<00:01:22.010> mils<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
mils of water to the five mils of the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.140 
mils of water to the five mils of the
PEM<00:01:23.960> Yulin<00:01:24.200> concentrate<00:01:24.830> will<00:01:25.580> add<00:01:25.760> three

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
PEM Yulin concentrate will add three

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.350 
PEM Yulin concentrate will add three
mils<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:27.580> water<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:34.520> we<00:01:34.670> want<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.940> break<00:01:35.120> that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
mils of water so we want to break that

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.240 
mils of water so we want to break that
big<00:01:35.750> lump<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.110> PEM<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.410> line<00:01:36.560> up<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.800> little<00:01:37.010> bit

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
big lump of PEM you line up a little bit

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.650 
big lump of PEM you line up a little bit
and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:37.820> we'll<00:01:37.910> do<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> rest<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.480> the<00:01:38.540> work

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
and then we'll do the rest of the work

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:52.240 
and then we'll do the rest of the work
with<00:01:38.870> a<00:01:38.900> magnetic<00:01:39.380> stirrer

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.590 

as<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.520> gel<00:01:53.700> thickens<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.390> sometimes

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
as the gel thickens it can sometimes

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.300 
as the gel thickens it can sometimes
start<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> spin<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.590> bottle<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
start to spin the bottle around so I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
start to spin the bottle around so I
like<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.909> piece<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.270> tape<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
like to put a little piece of tape to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.609 
like to put a little piece of tape to
hold<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> bottle<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.070> place<00:02:03.079> after<00:02:04.079> 5<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.469> 10

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
hold the bottle in place after 5 or 10

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
hold the bottle in place after 5 or 10
minutes<00:02:04.979> we'll<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.429> nice<00:02:05.670> smooth

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
minutes we'll have a nice smooth

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.499 
minutes we'll have a nice smooth
dispersion<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.289> PEM<00:02:07.469> Yulin<00:02:07.770> ph<00:02:08.069> 6.5<00:02:08.509> with

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.539 
determined by the formulism the mCP
normal<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.989> do<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:25.860> plastic<00:02:26.040> jar

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
normal I do this in a little plastic jar

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.759 
normal I do this in a little plastic jar
but<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> sake<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.690> visualization<00:02:28.380> I'm

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
but for the sake of visualization I'm

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.930 
but for the sake of visualization I'm
doing<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.099> in<00:02:29.220> glass

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.880 

so<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> nice<00:02:35.660> even<00:02:35.930> dispersion<00:02:36.740> of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
so now we have a nice even dispersion of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.000 
so now we have a nice even dispersion of
the<00:02:37.070> PEM<00:02:37.280> Yulin<00:02:37.840> system<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.920> be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the PEM Yulin system and this can be

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.310 
the PEM Yulin system and this can be
used<00:02:40.190> just<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.700> aqueous<00:02:40.850> material<00:02:41.780> you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
used just as the aqueous material you

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.190 
used just as the aqueous material you
can<00:02:42.470> see<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:42.800> nicely<00:02:43.100> gelled<00:02:44.200> nicely

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
can see it's nicely gelled nicely

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
can see it's nicely gelled nicely

painting to make an emulsion we want to
add<00:02:51.560> our<00:02:51.590> dispersed<00:02:52.160> phase<00:02:52.400> you'll<00:02:53.060> remember

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
add our dispersed phase you'll remember

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.230 
add our dispersed phase you'll remember
this<00:02:53.540> is<00:02:53.690> 10<00:02:54.050> mils<00:02:54.710> of<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.400> pam<00:02:55.580> Yulin<00:02:55.850> system

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
this is 10 mils of the pam Yulin system

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.290 
this is 10 mils of the pam Yulin system
so<00:02:56.780> we'll<00:02:56.930> add<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.110> mil<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.950> shelfs<00:02:58.370> LD<00:02:58.790> 38

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
so we'll add a mil of the shelfs LD 38

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.699 
so we'll add a mil of the shelfs LD 38
so<00:02:59.900> we'll<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.230> essentially<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.800> 10%<00:03:02.709> solution

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
so we'll have essentially a 10% solution

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:14.320 
so we'll have essentially a 10% solution
of<00:03:04.600> d<00:03:05.600> 38<00:03:06.110> in<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.800> pam<00:03:06.950> Yulin<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:13.760> addition<00:03:14.180> to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
of d 38 in the pam Yulin in addition to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.350 
of d 38 in the pam Yulin in addition to
a<00:03:14.630> shell<00:03:14.959> saw<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.440> can<00:03:15.590> also<00:03:15.739> use<00:03:16.130> xylene<00:03:17.120> for<00:03:17.330> a

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
a shell saw we can also use xylene for a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.140 
a shell saw we can also use xylene for a
higher<00:03:17.570> polarity<00:03:18.500> with<00:03:18.890> aromatic<00:03:19.580> quality<00:03:20.000> or

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
higher polarity with aromatic quality or

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.840 
higher polarity with aromatic quality or
even<00:03:20.230> for<00:03:21.230> yet<00:03:21.650> higher<00:03:21.860> polarity<00:03:22.400> we<00:03:22.520> can<00:03:22.670> use

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
even for yet higher polarity we can use

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.210 
even for yet higher polarity we can use
something<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.810> benzyl<00:03:24.290> alcohol<00:03:24.320> but

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
something like a benzyl alcohol but

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.100 
something like a benzyl alcohol but
whatever<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:25.730> put<00:03:25.910> in<00:03:26.060> has<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.450> be<00:03:26.570> non<00:03:26.810> water

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
whatever we put in has to be non water

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.500 
whatever we put in has to be non water
miscible<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.520> can<00:03:28.640> make<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.910> emulsion<00:03:29.180> as

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
miscible so it can make the emulsion as

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.280 
miscible so it can make the emulsion as
opposed<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.930> dissolving<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.840> again<00:03:33.020> we'll<00:03:33.170> let

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
opposed to dissolving so again we'll let

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.350 
opposed to dissolving so again we'll let
the<00:03:33.440> stir<00:03:33.650> for<00:03:33.860> 10<00:03:34.010> minutes<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.550> we<00:03:35.330> should

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
the stir for 10 minutes and we should

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.390 
the stir for 10 minutes and we should
have<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> nice<00:03:35.870> creamy<00:03:36.170> emulsion

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.180 

so<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.090> been<00:03:43.239> another<00:03:43.480> 5-10<00:03:43.780> minutes<00:03:44.409> we<00:03:45.010> now

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
so it's been another 5-10 minutes we now

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.690 
so it's been another 5-10 minutes we now
have<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> nice<00:03:46.290> emulsion<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.799> shelfs<00:03:48.280> Aldi

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
have a nice emulsion of the shelfs Aldi

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.649 
have a nice emulsion of the shelfs Aldi

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
if the ph 6.5 hemulen and citrate so you

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.240 
if the ph 6.5 hemulen and citrate so you
