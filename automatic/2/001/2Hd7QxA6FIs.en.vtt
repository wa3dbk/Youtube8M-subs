wheel we noticed it seemed to shake a
lot<00:00:14.759> more<00:00:15.000> than<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.719> were<00:00:15.839> used<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.529> we

developing<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.199> product<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.340> three

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
developing the product we have three

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
developing the product we have three
criteria<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.179> immediately<00:00:30.720> thought<00:00:30.900> we

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
criteria we immediately thought we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.600 
criteria we immediately thought we
wanted<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> product<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
wanted we want to have a product that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.860 
wanted we want to have a product that
works<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.149> be<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> number<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:33.840> thing

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
works that would be the number one thing

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.229 
works that would be the number one thing
number<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> easy<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> use

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
number two it need to be easy to use

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
number two it need to be easy to use
then<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.750> wanted<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> sell

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
then we wanted it if we're going to sell

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
then we wanted it if we're going to sell
it<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.160> need<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> fit<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.610> every<00:00:38.820> trailer<00:00:39.180> we

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it we need to fit on every trailer we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
it we need to fit on every trailer we
are<00:00:39.540> basically<00:00:39.989> using<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.860> applying<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
are basically using and applying it to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.630 
are basically using and applying it to
the<00:00:42.239> trailer<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.230> permanent<00:00:44.070> structure

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the trailer as a permanent structure

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.760 
the trailer as a permanent structure
vehicle<00:00:45.210> instead<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.870> mobile<00:00:46.140> structure

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

vehicle steady fast stabilizing system

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.279 
vehicle steady fast stabilizing system
is<00:00:49.640> basically<00:00:50.640> made<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.329> three<00:00:51.690> critical

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is basically made up of three critical

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.160 
is basically made up of three critical
elements<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:52.980> something<00:00:53.370> solid<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
elements you need something solid to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
elements you need something solid to
anchor<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.860> stop<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> strata<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.670> moving

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
anchor to to stop you strata from moving

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
anchor to to stop you strata from moving
we<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.989> out<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> three<00:00:58.829> padded

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
we start that out with a three padded

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
we start that out with a three padded
foot<00:00:59.340> plate<00:00:59.579> attached<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> foot<00:01:00.719> plate

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
foot plate attached to that foot plate

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.640 
foot plate attached to that foot plate
is<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> brace<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.579> brace<00:01:02.910> has<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:04.260> swivel

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
is a brace and that brace has one swivel

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
is a brace and that brace has one swivel
then<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> allows<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.460> jack<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
then it allows the jack to go up and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590 
then it allows the jack to go up and
down<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> unique<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.700> products<00:01:09.299> ours

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
down and unique to other products ours

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.109 
down and unique to other products ours
has<00:01:10.260> no<00:01:10.470> play<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.310> last<00:01:11.549> mechanism

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
has no play in that the last mechanism

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
has no play in that the last mechanism
which<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.290> kind

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
which I really like and is really kind

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320 
which I really like and is really kind
of<00:01:13.530> unique<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.070> call<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> locking<00:01:14.760> mechanism

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
of unique we call the locking mechanism

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
of unique we call the locking mechanism
it<00:01:15.509> has<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> nice<00:01:16.110> big<00:01:16.409> handle<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> that's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it has a nice big handle on it that's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
it has a nice big handle on it that's
easy<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> hold<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> tighten

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
easy to get a hold of and tighten

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.420 
easy to get a hold of and tighten
doesn't<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.110> time<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.560> tight<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
doesn't every time very tight it has a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
doesn't every time very tight it has a
bracket<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.390> pushes<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.930> against<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> tube

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
bracket that pushes up against the tube

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
bracket that pushes up against the tube
and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> tube<00:01:23.159> goes<00:01:23.310> through<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> hole<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and the tube goes through the hole to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
and the tube goes through the hole to
lock<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.479> place<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.350> allows<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
lock it in place and what that allows is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
lock it in place and what that allows is
the<00:01:26.070> brace<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.420> go<00:01:27.689> any

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the brace to pretty much go any

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.480 
the brace to pretty much go any
different<00:01:28.290> angle<00:01:28.590> through<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
different angle through it's really a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.210 
different angle through it's really a
very<00:01:29.790> versatile<00:01:30.420> bracket<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.740> use<00:01:31.950> many

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
very versatile bracket we use many

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.219 
very versatile bracket we use many
