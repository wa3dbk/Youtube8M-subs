00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
will the Penguins in the wild they can

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.440 
will the Penguins in the wild they can
only<00:00:39.360> live<00:00:39.570> about<00:00:39.649> 15<00:00:40.649> years<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.030> penguins

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
only live about 15 years the penguins

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.360 
only live about 15 years the penguins
here<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.840> captivity<00:00:43.260> they<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.829> actually<00:00:44.040> live

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
here in captivity they can actually live

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.930 
here in captivity they can actually live
up<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.520> 30<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.629> even<00:00:45.960> 40<00:00:46.620> years<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.700> mainly

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
up to 30 to even 40 years that's mainly

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
up to 30 to even 40 years that's mainly
because<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> care<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.140> actually

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
because of the care that we actually

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
because of the care that we actually
give<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.340> haven't<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:50.850> any<00:00:51.120> predators

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
give them they haven't got any predators

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.869 
give them they haven't got any predators
here<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.320> captivity<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.520> they've<00:00:53.699> got

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
here in captivity and they've got

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.540 
here in captivity and they've got
obviously<00:00:54.000> excellent<00:00:54.719> veterinary<00:00:55.199> care

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
obviously excellent veterinary care

penguins come from the southern

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.530 
penguins come from the southern
hemisphere<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.729> they<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.909> come<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.240> warm

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
hemisphere and they can come from warm

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.890 
hemisphere and they can come from warm
and<00:01:21.869> cold<00:01:22.590> countries<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.420> Humboldt

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and cold countries things like Humboldt

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
and cold countries things like Humboldt
penguins<00:01:25.080> they<00:01:25.470> come<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:25.860> off<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> coast<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
penguins they come from off the coast of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
penguins they come from off the coast of
Chile<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.409> they<00:01:28.409> come<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.250> really

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Chile and they come from really really

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
Chile and they come from really really
hot<00:01:29.700> places<00:01:29.970> during<00:01:30.329> summer<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.290> up

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
hot places during summer it can get up

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.760 
hot places during summer it can get up
to<00:01:31.799> 35<00:01:32.729> degrees<00:01:33.180> during<00:01:33.900> winter<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.619> get

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to 35 degrees during winter it can get

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
to 35 degrees during winter it can get
really<00:01:35.040> cold<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.700> they<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.970> handle<00:01:36.240> both

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
really cold so they can handle both

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
really cold so they can handle both
temperatures<00:01:37.189> penguins<00:01:38.189> such<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.520> jackass

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
temperatures penguins such as jackass

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.399 
temperatures penguins such as jackass
penguins<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> black-footed<00:01:40.110> penguins

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
penguins or the black-footed penguins

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
penguins or the black-footed penguins
they<00:01:41.369> come<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.850> South<00:01:42.119> Africa<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.869> again

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
they come from South Africa so again

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
they come from South Africa so again
from<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.710> hot<00:01:43.860> places<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
from really hot places and then of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
from really hot places and then of
course<00:01:45.060> you've<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.049> sort<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
course you've got the really sort of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
course you've got the really sort of
cold<00:01:46.770> weather<00:01:46.979> penguins<00:01:47.549> things<00:01:48.119> like

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
cold weather penguins things like

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
cold weather penguins things like
emperor<00:01:48.780> penguins<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.530> come<00:01:49.770> from

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
emperor penguins that come from

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.310 
emperor penguins that come from
Antarctica<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> really

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
Antarctica from a really

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
Antarctica from a really
cold<00:01:52.650> freezing<00:01:53.550> places<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:54.450> penguins<00:01:54.810> beep

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
cold freezing places so penguins beep

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.080 
cold freezing places so penguins beep
can't<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.830> freeze<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.850> can

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
can't really freeze because they can

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.750 
can't really freeze because they can
actually<00:01:57.630> control<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> blood<00:01:58.470> flow<00:01:58.830> into

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
actually control the blood flow into

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.270 
actually control the blood flow into
their<00:01:59.909> feet<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.020> during<00:02:01.380> really<00:02:01.650> cold<00:02:01.800> weather

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
their feet so during really cold weather

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
their feet so during really cold weather

when they're standing on their feet on
the<00:02:03.990> ice<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:04.830> can<00:02:05.010> actually<00:02:05.250> reduce<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
the ice they can actually reduce the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.700 
the ice they can actually reduce the
black<00:02:06.119> folks<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.780> black<00:02:07.050> flowed<00:02:07.290> into<00:02:07.470> their

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
black folks like black flowed into their

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
actual temperature so that way they

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.640 
actual temperature so that way they
don't<00:02:14.760> freeze<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.570> penguins<00:02:15.990> favorite<00:02:16.380> food
