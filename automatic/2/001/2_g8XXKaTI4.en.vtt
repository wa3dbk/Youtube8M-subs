ohm<00:00:21.510> speakers<00:00:23.000> which<00:00:24.000> obviously<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> little

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
ohm speakers which obviously a little

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
ohm speakers which obviously a little
bit<00:00:24.720> better<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.990> Philips<00:00:29.179> 320
