00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.320
 and here folks here with kleber yagami that 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.389
 took second place in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 king of fighters 13 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:26.070
 That 's enough for me, I just wanted to ask more. 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.510
 only you one day you live with her 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 How did you comment on how this story began? 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.940
 with fighting games 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.300
 so I'm from Sao Paulo I started to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.430
 play from 93 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.309
 the company had the first edition until 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 today i love ford sync here i played all 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 the versions 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.610
 I'm a fan, it 's a privilege to be here. 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 I got second place. 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.590
 I wish I had come to the first one but 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.300
 second 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 really good shows that the level 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.160
 here in brazil is very high 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.219
 there are quality people playing here 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.500
 in Brazil it is not this image that sometimes 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 the people out there have to think that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 no level players 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.330
 this is an example that we have levels for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.130
 able to play with the outside and the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.720
 We have a serious connection problem. 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 here in Brazil, because our 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.330
 internet is not as good as the internet 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 two gringos 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.740
 then this one asks a lot of people to have 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.330
 good matches online and how do you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.799
 do to train since we have this 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.180
 All rights reserved. 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.909
 I train once a week because I do not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.400
 have the time so join the staff 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.770
 during work commitment week 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 However in the pasture this week 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 people have once a week joined a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.030
 group of generally eight people to 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.729
 I can do a workout, but it's a little bit 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.560
 It's even a night of training at the same time. 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.680
 so it's very difficult for us to be able 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.960
 training online makes it very difficult 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.040
 and so if we could online one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.729
 good connection could give a good life 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.969
 best workout session 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.990
 seven years so it's practically a day 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.179
 santo is all yours cof cof cof 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.060
 all practically a role the same day 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.270
 week has ct currently playing some 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.630
 another game is dedicating itself 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.370
 but the safe is currently more occurring by 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.370
 lack of time I like other games 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.990
 other titles also street the mortal 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.420
 kombat I loved mortal kombat more 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.090
 unfortunately I had to fix it 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
 only in cof which is one of the series that 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 I love 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 so I had to choose xix in a 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.120
 Cool coke , we saw your match. 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.550
 yesterday was fantastic 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.490
 It was made clear to everyone who 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.060
 Brazil is not free the agent gives 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.920
 work and with a great representative and I 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.530
 'm here the first hit sent the final 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.780
 from the urns to lights and you came back with 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.080
 everything that happened there that suddenly 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.950
 You came with grenade and it was a lot 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.300
 well with the touch of what happened and I 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.980
 I did not know his game. 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.560
 the character as he plays is not 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 accustomed to playing and we have 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.940
 this habit of being able to catch a game 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.920
 so fast here when I came back 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 I was able to adapt better to his game. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.230
 so it made me better. 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.900
 not to have achieved the title 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.370
 I finally got much better at 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.709
 when I became the Portuguese is to give 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.470
 the result is to reject the pec and still 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.500
 to win two more that gave a lot of work 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.209
 to him it was really a shock 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 It sure was great. 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.870
 visible to us one hour did he have 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.150
 It was very complicated. 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.980
 What did you think of the league in boys? 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.380
 is what you thought was how the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.570
 more difficulties if it was was the met 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.600
 office was the fact of not knowing the game 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.600
 opponent is really another game of the 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.540
 opponent has a habit of playing with 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.190
 certain characters and this ends 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.380
 making this somewhat difficult for lack of 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.910
 so we do not have online too 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.910
 and online 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.489
 It's where we could play with more 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 different characters know different 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.600
 types of character other than people 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.150
 play in a group that is always sometimes 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.100
 same character makes it difficult for 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.540
 to be able to evolve and develop a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.170
 game against certain types of characters 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.840
 It's true yesterday we saw that Brazil 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.150
 different from many countries do not have 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.730
 and if this question of regionalisms 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.810
 twisting only the Brazilian province gave 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.880
 to see yesterday that everyone was 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.950
 screaming for your name and not for Brazil 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.900
 everyone was proud to have a 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.740
 player at the level of others to 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.540
 represent 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.150
 I want to know that you wanted to leave one 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.130
 personal message with some member of 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.740
 anything at all for them was to see only 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.690
 thank you very much for the strength of the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.110
 personal twist in stream 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.210
 here we have always given that strength 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.850
 it is really very important that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.170
 feels valued in reality is very 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:09.080
 good and thank you from the bottom of my heart 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.270
 all who cheered for me so did I 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.100
 I think that from now on, 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.650
 several opportunities to play 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.520
 with people from other parts of the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.170
 world 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.510
 It's cool, you plan who knows. 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.370
 play for an evo prom bigger tournament 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.830
 endlessly with my plans for the year 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.170
 next you're participating in the error 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.570
 so I compare with so quite 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.720
 prospect of coming out next year 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.550
 That way it's legal can force give and 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.260
