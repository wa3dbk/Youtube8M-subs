00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
already just playing with it myself so

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.619 
already just playing with it myself so
on<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.340> side<00:00:43.640> here<00:00:43.670> which<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.480> get<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.809> focus

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
on the side here which I get the focus

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.680 
on the side here which I get the focus
so<00:00:47.629> on<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.899> side<00:00:48.140> here<00:00:48.620> you've<00:00:49.070> got<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.940> time

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
so on the side here you've got a time

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.970 
so on the side here you've got a time
delay<00:00:51.460> wheel<00:00:52.480> where<00:00:53.480> it<00:00:53.809> can<00:00:54.050> adjust<00:00:54.170> anywhere

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
delay wheel where it can adjust anywhere

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.549 
delay wheel where it can adjust anywhere
from<00:00:55.280> five<00:00:55.969> second<00:00:56.480> delay<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:57.050> fifteen

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
from five second delay to a fifteen

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.160 
from five second delay to a fifteen
minute<00:00:57.710> delay<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:59.360> then<00:00:59.600> you<00:00:59.870> have<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
minute delay and then you have the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.889 
minute delay and then you have the
options<00:01:00.710> for<00:01:00.920> what<00:01:01.160> kind<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.760> phantom

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.670 

operations<00:01:05.899> you<00:01:06.020> want<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.289> do<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
operations you want to do to the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.310 
operations you want to do to the
computer<00:01:07.160> so<00:01:07.399> one<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.240> them<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.450> caps<00:01:08.780> lock<00:01:09.110> one

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
computer so one of them is caps lock one

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.039 
computer so one of them is caps lock one
of<00:01:09.439> them<00:01:09.590> is<00:01:09.710> keyboard<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.400> one<00:01:10.549> is<00:01:10.760> Mouse<00:01:11.049> so

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
of them is keyboard and one is Mouse so

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.690 
of them is keyboard and one is Mouse so
now<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.200> have<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.680> wheel<00:01:12.860> scroll<00:01:13.340> all<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.610> way

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
now I have the wheel scroll all the way

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460 
now I have the wheel scroll all the way
to<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.970> left<00:01:14.240> which<00:01:14.540> means<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.049> on<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> five

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
to the left which means it's on a five

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.830 
to the left which means it's on a five
second<00:01:15.950> delay<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.790> I've<00:01:17.360> got<00:01:17.570> all<00:01:17.689> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
second delay and I've got all the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.760 
second delay and I've got all the
options<00:01:17.869> turned<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.100> caps<00:01:19.400> lock<00:01:20.770> keyboard

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
options turned on so caps lock keyboard

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.600 
options turned on so caps lock keyboard
and<00:01:22.130> mouse<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:24.860> we're<00:01:25.040> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> take<00:01:25.549> a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and mouse and so we're going to take a

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.670 
and mouse and so we're going to take a
look<00:01:25.880> real<00:01:26.090> quick<00:01:26.150> here<00:01:26.659> at<00:01:26.780> my<00:01:27.400> monitor<00:01:29.680> and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
look real quick here at my monitor and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.980 
look real quick here at my monitor and
this<00:01:30.860> shows<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:31.580> gives<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.390> an<00:01:32.450> idea<00:01:32.509> of

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
this shows you just gives you an idea of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.440 
this shows you just gives you an idea of
what<00:01:33.259> kind<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.890> havoc<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.820> can<00:01:35.000> make<00:01:35.240> with

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
what kind of havoc you can make with

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.069 
what kind of havoc you can make with
this<00:01:35.659> little<00:01:36.619> device<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.659> can<00:01:38.720> see<00:01:38.930> by

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
this little device so as you can see by

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.359 
this little device so as you can see by
every<00:01:39.350> five<00:01:39.619> seconds<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.710> mouse<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.189> right

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
every five seconds the mouse is right

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.840 
every five seconds the mouse is right
here<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.299> cursor<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.619> Scrolls<00:01:46.430> around

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
here the cursor and it Scrolls around

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.330 
here the cursor and it Scrolls around
and<00:01:47.360> makes<00:01:47.630> its<00:01:47.810> way<00:01:47.899> slowly<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.009> upper

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
and makes its way slowly to the upper

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.789 
and makes its way slowly to the upper
left<00:01:49.520> hand<00:01:49.700> corner<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.360> screen<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:51.649> it

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
left hand corner of the screen so it

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.679 
left hand corner of the screen so it
will<00:01:51.890> scribble<00:01:52.280> around<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.299> makes<00:01:53.540> its

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
will scribble around and it makes its

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.870 
will scribble around and it makes its
way<00:01:53.720> up<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.079> left<00:01:54.350> hand<00:01:54.500> corner<00:01:54.920> but<00:01:54.950> every

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
way up to the left hand corner but every

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.280 
way up to the left hand corner but every
five<00:01:56.149> seconds<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:58.329> your<00:01:59.329> cursor<00:01:59.750> will<00:01:59.990> scrip

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
five seconds that your cursor will scrip

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.609 
five seconds that your cursor will scrip
around<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.070> move<00:02:01.600> as<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:03.049> can<00:02:03.200> see<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.409> little

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
around and move as you can see a little

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.969 
around and move as you can see a little
pop<00:02:03.950> up<00:02:04.219> here<00:02:04.579> that's<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.090> caps<00:02:05.360> lock<00:02:05.979> turning

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
pop up here that's the caps lock turning

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.520 
pop up here that's the caps lock turning
itself<00:02:07.369> on<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.909> off<00:02:08.000> every<00:02:08.479> five<00:02:08.690> seconds<00:02:09.320> and

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
itself on and off every five seconds and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.190 
itself on and off every five seconds and
then<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.519> spews<00:02:11.299> out<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.540> little<00:02:11.900> bit<00:02:12.080> of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
then it it spews out a little bit of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.589 
then it it spews out a little bit of
text<00:02:12.830> now<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.220> thought<00:02:13.580> at<00:02:13.700> first<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.270> some

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
text now I thought at first that be some

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.260 
text now I thought at first that be some
random<00:02:14.870> tax<00:02:15.379> but<00:02:16.099> it's<00:02:16.190> actually<00:02:16.489> not<00:02:16.520> random

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
random tax but it's actually not random

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.410 
random tax but it's actually not random
it's<00:02:17.600> actually<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.850> actually<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.390> a

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
it's actually it's actually like a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.520
