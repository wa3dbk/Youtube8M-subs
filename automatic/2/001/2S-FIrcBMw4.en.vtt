fertilizer a 533 and after that and
we'll<00:00:53.810> add<00:00:53.930> something<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.380> may<00:00:54.530> not<00:00:54.560> use<00:00:54.800> too

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
we'll add something you may not use too

tempted to try to plant all of these but
really<00:03:17.349> it's<00:03:17.769> not<00:03:17.890> worth<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.310> you're<00:03:18.459> going<00:03:18.610> to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
really it's not worth it you're going to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
really it's not worth it you're going to
get<00:03:18.910> damaged<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.690> other<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.319> I'll<00:03:20.410> just

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
get damaged the other one so I'll just

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.860 
get damaged the other one so I'll just
pluck<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.830> out<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.129> leave<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.819> good<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.180> now

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
pluck it out and leave the good one now

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.630 
pluck it out and leave the good one now

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.750 
how deep that plant is in there looks
pretty<00:03:51.450> deep<00:03:51.840> in<00:03:52.080> an<00:03:52.200> effort<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.620> date<00:03:52.890> but
