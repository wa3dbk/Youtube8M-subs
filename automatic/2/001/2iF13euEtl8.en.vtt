about this we're excited to show this to
the<00:00:13.559> public<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.730> our<00:00:15.210> first

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the public it's actually our first

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.320 
the public it's actually our first
tractor<00:00:15.839> where<00:00:16.619> we've<00:00:16.800> taken<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
tractor where we've taken the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.700 
tractor where we've taken the
traditional<00:00:18.330> diesel<00:00:18.570> engine<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
traditional diesel engine out of the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.189 
traditional diesel engine out of the
tractor<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.760> replaced<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.600> with<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.869> very

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
tractor and replaced it with a very

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.890 
tractor and replaced it with a very
simple<00:00:22.560> system<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> includes<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.000> hydrogen

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
simple system that includes a hydrogen

storage tank of hydrogen fuel cells and
an<00:00:28.320> air<00:00:28.500> compressor<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.670> instead<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> running

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
an air compressor so instead of running

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.390 
an air compressor so instead of running
a<00:00:30.810> diesel<00:00:31.230> engine<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:32.250> typically<00:00:32.759> have

this<00:01:03.230> tractor<00:01:03.710> will<00:01:03.860> run<00:01:04.070> outside<00:01:05.030> about<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
this tractor will run outside about a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.650 
this tractor will run outside about a
DBA<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.320> about<00:01:06.560> 55<00:01:07.280> as<00:01:07.940> opposed<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.540> a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
DBA of about 55 as opposed to a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.359 
DBA of about 55 as opposed to a
traditional<00:01:09.259> tractor<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.860> could<00:01:09.920> be<00:01:10.220> up

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
traditional tractor that could be up

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.850 
traditional tractor that could be up
close<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.940> 80<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:11.899> we<00:01:12.020> have<00:01:12.170> an<00:01:12.320> extremely

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
close to 80 so we have an extremely

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.240 
close to 80 so we have an extremely
quiet<00:01:13.220> machine<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.229> whole<00:01:15.410> concept<00:01:15.710> is

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
quiet machine but the whole concept is

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.670 
quiet machine but the whole concept is
really<00:01:16.430> just<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.970> piece<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.930> something<00:01:18.259> bigger

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
really just a piece of something bigger

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160 
really just a piece of something bigger
we<00:01:18.979> call<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.369> energy<00:01:19.550> independent<00:01:20.509> farm

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
we call the energy independent farm

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.639 
we call the energy independent farm
our<00:01:21.590> vision<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.220> farmers<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.210> future<00:01:23.780> can

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
our vision is farmers of the future can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.940 
our vision is farmers of the future can
incorporate<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.550> into<00:01:25.850> their<00:01:26.030> farm<00:01:26.539> stead

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
incorporate this into their farm stead

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180 
incorporate this into their farm stead
but<00:01:27.950> they<00:01:28.100> could<00:01:28.280> also<00:01:28.430> use<00:01:29.000> things<00:01:29.869> like<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
but they could also use things like the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.260 
but they could also use things like the
Sun<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.940> wind<00:01:32.770> biogas<00:01:33.770> methane<00:01:34.270> generators

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
Sun the wind biogas methane generators

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.260 
Sun the wind biogas methane generators
to<00:01:35.930> produce<00:01:36.140> their<00:01:36.560> own<00:01:36.590> electricity<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.030> as

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
to produce their own electricity and as

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.570 
to produce their own electricity and as
they<00:01:38.450> do<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.690> they're<00:01:39.440> not<00:01:39.590> only<00:01:39.649> powering

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
they do that they're not only powering

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.880 
they do that they're not only powering
the<00:01:40.910> farmstead<00:01:41.300> but<00:01:42.259> they're<00:01:42.380> also<00:01:42.530> has

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
the farmstead but they're also has

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.370 
the farmstead but they're also has
developing<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.789> capability

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
developing and capability

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.440 
developing and capability
providing<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.520> creating<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.390> generating

providing and creating and generating

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.499 
providing and creating and generating
their<00:01:48.229> own<00:01:48.259> hydrogen<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:49.970> can<00:01:50.150> store

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
their own hydrogen and they can store

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.780 
their own hydrogen and they can store
that<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:51.080> for<00:01:51.439> use<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.830> their<00:01:51.979> tractors<00:01:52.580> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
that then for use in their tractors and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
that then for use in their tractors and
equipment<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.479> future<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.470> they<00:01:54.590> become

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
equipment of the future so they become

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.010 
equipment of the future so they become
slightly<00:01:55.310> more<00:01:55.520> energy<00:01:56.210> independent<00:01:56.900> than

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
slightly more energy independent than

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.710 
slightly more energy independent than
they<00:01:57.170> are<00:01:57.440> today<00:01:57.880> right<00:01:58.880> now<00:01:58.909> whoa<00:01:59.270> what<00:01:59.690> about

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
they are today right now whoa what about

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.389 
they are today right now whoa what about
a<00:02:00.580> availability<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:02.020> things<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.740> know

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
a availability and things like I know

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.300 
a availability and things like I know
the<00:02:04.789> first<00:02:05.030> thing<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.570> might<00:02:05.810> ask<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.350> well<00:02:06.590> when

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
the first thing I might ask is well when
