00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
box but it's a like it's a lot bigger it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
box but it's a like it's a lot bigger it
is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> lot<00:00:54.750> bigger<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.530> basically<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.850> got

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is a lot bigger so basically we just got

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.840 
is a lot bigger so basically we just got
the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.480> box<00:00:57.870> design<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:59.100> features<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> light

manual<00:01:13.320> ISM<00:01:13.650> quite<00:01:14.460> thick<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.970> could<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
manual ISM quite thick this could have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.710 
manual ISM quite thick this could have
used<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.070> personally<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.700> quite<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
used to personally I think it's quite a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
used to personally I think it's quite a
few<00:01:18.960> pages<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> hard<00:01:20.159> bill<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.729> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
few pages it's not a hard bill but it is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.859 
few pages it's not a hard bill but it is
honestly<00:01:21.869> actually<00:01:22.259> pretty<00:01:22.439> long<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.869> 74

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
honestly actually pretty long as 74

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.050 
honestly actually pretty long as 74
pages<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.409> building<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.220> that's<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:26.880> much

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
pages of building so that's pretty much

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
pages of building so that's pretty much
it<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> instruction<00:01:28.020> manual<00:01:28.310> no<00:01:29.310> real

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it for the instruction manual no real

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.569 
it for the instruction manual no real

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
doesn't make any sense i mean it kind of

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.930 
doesn't make any sense i mean it kind of
has<00:06:59.940> to<00:06:59.970> be<00:07:00.240> like<00:07:00.360> that<00:07:00.420> somewhat<00:07:01.730> well<00:07:02.730> yeah

has to be like that somewhat well yeah
this<00:07:03.120> is<00:07:03.240> definitely<00:07:03.390> by<00:07:03.840> far<00:07:03.870> the<00:07:04.230> best<00:07:04.440> type

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
this is definitely by far the best type

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.160 
this is definitely by far the best type
of<00:07:04.650> such<00:07:04.980> that<00:07:05.190> they've<00:07:05.370> made<00:07:05.640> um<00:07:05.970> that's<00:07:06.870> like

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
of such that they've made um that's like

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.140 
of such that they've made um that's like
completely<00:07:07.710> true<00:07:08.220> like<00:07:08.430> every<00:07:08.670> other<00:07:08.760> one<00:07:09.000> was
