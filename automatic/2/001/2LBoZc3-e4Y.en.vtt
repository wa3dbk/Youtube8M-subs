00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
of having trouble figuring that out at

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
of having trouble figuring that out at
first<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> guess<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.399> was<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.579> being<00:00:56.910> derpy

I<00:00:58.609> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.850> together<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.480> fact<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I kind of put together the fact that the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.590 
I kind of put together the fact that the
protein<00:01:01.739> filler<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.600> supposed<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.989> prevent

protein filler is supposed to prevent

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
protein filler is supposed to prevent
your<00:01:06.600> hair<00:01:06.900> which<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.170> porous<00:01:07.619> after<00:01:08.220> using

come out a little more quickly and even
though<00:02:21.700> I've<00:02:21.850> been<00:02:22.000> using<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.480> it's<00:02:22.810> really

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
though I've been using that it's really

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.980 
though I've been using that it's really
had<00:02:23.320> no<00:02:23.530> effect<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.940> sections<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.540> my<00:02:25.690> hair

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
had no effect on the sections of my hair

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.260 
had no effect on the sections of my hair
that<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.230> Color<00:02:26.440> Oops<00:02:26.650> was<00:02:26.980> used<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.120> on

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
that the Color Oops was used on but on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.630 
that the Color Oops was used on but on
my<00:02:28.450> natural<00:02:28.660> growth<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.500> actually<00:02:29.980> pulled

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
my natural growth it's actually pulled

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.380 
my natural growth it's actually pulled
quite<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> bit<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.360> color<00:02:31.570> off<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:33.390> my

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
quite a bit of the color off so my

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.270 
quite a bit of the color off so my
suggestion<00:02:34.960> would<00:02:35.320> be<00:02:35.380> even<00:02:35.890> if<00:02:35.980> you're<00:02:36.130> going

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
suggestion would be even if you're going

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
suggestion would be even if you're going
to<00:02:36.520> be<00:02:36.670> using<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.330> semi<00:02:37.810> permanent<00:02:38.140> or

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
to be using a semi permanent or

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.520 
to be using a semi permanent or
temporary<00:02:38.590> color<00:02:39.420> still<00:02:40.420> use<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.110> protein

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
temporary color still use the protein

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.950 
temporary color still use the protein
filler<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.640> will<00:02:42.850> help<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.780> not

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
filler because that will help it to not

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.900 
filler because that will help it to not
come<00:02:44.290> out<00:02:44.410> as<00:02:44.680> dark<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:47.460> also<00:02:48.460> wanted<00:02:48.850> to

another note about the protein filler
they<00:04:24.160> do<00:04:24.220> make<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:25.440> neutral<00:04:26.440> protein<00:04:26.919> filler

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
they do make a neutral protein filler

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.960 
they do make a neutral protein filler
and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:27.729> they

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
and then they

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.230 
and then they
make<00:04:28.090> protein<00:04:28.900> fillers<00:04:29.290> with<00:04:29.530> tints<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.460> them

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
make protein fillers with tints in them

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.560 
make protein fillers with tints in them
I<00:04:31.270> used<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.470> neutral<00:04:33.210> protein<00:04:34.210> filler

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
I used the neutral protein filler

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.840 
I used the neutral protein filler
because<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.560> didn't<00:04:36.010> want<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.250> add<00:04:36.430> any<00:04:36.460> other

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
because I I didn't want to add any other

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.500 
because I I didn't want to add any other
color<00:04:37.660> dimensions<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.530> my<00:04:38.650> hair<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:39.640> if<00:04:40.060> if

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
color dimensions to my hair so if if

color dimensions to my hair so if if
you're<00:04:40.930> not<00:04:40.960> looking<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.410> do<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.770> make<00:04:42.070> sure

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
you're not looking to do that make sure

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.460 
you're not looking to do that make sure
that<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:42.760> get<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.660> neutral<00:04:44.080> protein

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
that you get the the neutral protein

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.980 
that you get the the neutral protein
filler<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.010> not<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.550> one<00:04:45.760> with<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.210> tint<00:04:46.750> in

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
filler and not the one with the tint in

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.590 
filler and not the one with the tint in
it<00:04:47.170> because<00:04:47.500> you<00:04:47.890> won't<00:04:48.130> get<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:49.330> color

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
it because you won't get the color

it because you won't get the color
you're<00:04:49.870> expecting<00:04:50.470> you'll<00:04:50.680> probably<00:04:50.890> have<00:04:51.450> I

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
won't come out the way that you think it

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.960 
won't come out the way that you think it

the fact well after using the color oops

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.330 
the fact well after using the color oops
you<00:05:09.910> should<00:05:10.180> still<00:05:10.390> use<00:05:10.420> a<00:05:11.080> protein<00:05:11.980> filler

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
you should still use a protein filler

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.360 
you should still use a protein filler
unless<00:05:13.150> you're<00:05:13.450> looking<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:14.170> have<00:05:14.380> really

dark hair probably hair that's at least
