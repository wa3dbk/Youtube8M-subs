00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.179 
there so I've got quite a few boards
there<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> top<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.590> bards

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
there so at the top you can see bards

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.310 
there so at the top you can see bards
pins<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.180> these<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.540> bars<00:01:48.899> I've<00:01:49.110> made

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pins and like so these my bars I've made

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310 
pins and like so these my bars I've made
myself<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.549> also<00:01:50.670> make<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.479> secret<00:01:52.049> board

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

myself you can also make a secret board
which<00:01:52.560> our<00:01:52.770> boards<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:54.180> normal<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
which our boards and that normal could

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
which our boards and that normal could
see<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.619> next<00:01:55.799> one<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> pins<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.119> know

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
see and the next one is pins you know

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.580 
see and the next one is pins you know
these<00:01:57.450> are<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.869> ones<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> I've<00:01:58.290> pins

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
these are all the ones that I've pins
