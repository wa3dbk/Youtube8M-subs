bit it is in 215 we'll check a crazy

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.210 
bit it is in 215 we'll check a crazy
amount<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> wrestlers<00:00:19.170> allowed<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> ring

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
amount of wrestlers allowed in the ring

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
amount of wrestlers allowed in the ring
at<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> same<00:00:20.580> time<00:00:21.000> now<00:00:21.660> guys<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.380> far<00:00:22.710> we've

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
at the same time now guys so far we've

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
at the same time now guys so far we've
not<00:00:22.980> heard<00:00:23.250> anything<00:00:23.609> regarding<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
not heard anything regarding that but I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.750 
not heard anything regarding that but I
think<00:00:25.260> personally<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.400> decent

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
think personally there is a decent

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
think personally there is a decent
chance<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.449> gonna<00:00:27.539> happen<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> don't

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
chance it's gonna happen now I don't

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
chance it's gonna happen now I don't
think<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.340> doable<00:00:29.699> for<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
think that's gonna be doable for the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.569 
think that's gonna be doable for the
last<00:00:30.330> gen<00:00:30.539> consoles<00:00:31.019> necessarily<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.489> I'm

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
last gen consoles necessarily but I'm

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360 
last gen consoles necessarily but I'm
pretty<00:00:32.880> short<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> ps4<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> Xbox<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
pretty short the ps4 and the Xbox one it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
pretty short the ps4 and the Xbox one it
could<00:00:35.520> definitely<00:00:35.790> allow<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> work<00:00:36.809> now

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
could definitely allow it to work now

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
could definitely allow it to work now
I'm<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.800> saying<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.370> crazy<00:00:38.850> amount<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I'm not saying a crazy amount of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
I'm not saying a crazy amount of
superstars<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> ring<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
superstars should be in the ring at the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
superstars should be in the ring at the
same<00:00:41.129> time<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.360> race<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.870> eight

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
same time but I think a race the eight

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
same time but I think a race the eight
in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> ring<00:00:43.469> from<00:00:43.890> six<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.670> certain<00:00:44.940> match

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
in the ring from six for certain match

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
in the ring from six for certain match
types<00:00:45.420> could<00:00:45.930> definitely<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> possibility

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
types could definitely be a possibility

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.790 
types could definitely be a possibility
I<00:00:47.610> fit<00:00:48.270> those<00:00:48.450> match<00:00:48.690> types<00:00:49.020> would<00:00:49.440> include

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I fit those match types would include

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.939 
I fit those match types would include
the<00:00:49.980> Survivor<00:00:50.340> Series<00:00:50.489> style<00:00:51.149> tag<00:00:51.480> team<00:00:51.690> match

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
the Survivor Series style tag team match

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.229 
the Survivor Series style tag team match
ideally<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.100> will<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> 10-9<00:00:53.820> tag-team

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
ideally that will be a 10-9 tag-team

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
ideally that will be a 10-9 tag-team
match<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.050> 10<00:00:55.289> might<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.530> asked<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
match but I think 10 might be asked for

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.389 
match but I think 10 might be asked for
too<00:00:55.949> much

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
too much

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.240 
too much
so<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> an<00:00:58.469> eight-man<00:00:58.800> could<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so for for make it an eight-man could be

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
so for for make it an eight-man could be
pretty<00:00:59.550> cool<00:00:59.789> also<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:01.020> eight-man<00:01:01.350> ladder

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
pretty cool also an eight-man ladder

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
pretty cool also an eight-man ladder
match<00:01:01.829> money<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> max<00:01:02.699> style<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.570> most

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
match money the max style and most

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
match money the max style and most
importantly<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.799> limit<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> eight<00:01:05.580> superstars

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
importantly a limit of eight superstars

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.969 
importantly a limit of eight superstars
in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> ring<00:01:06.479> full<00:01:07.140> eight<00:01:07.350> water<00:01:07.590> Rumble

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
in the ring full eight water Rumble
match<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.540> those<00:01:09.689> positives<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
match now do you get those positives and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
match now do you get those positives and
negatives<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.670> raising<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> play<00:01:12.390> limit<00:01:12.750> now

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
negatives for raising the play limit now

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
negatives for raising the play limit now
I<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.619> those<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.010> extra<00:01:14.220> superstars<00:01:14.850> in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I get those two extra superstars in

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
I get those two extra superstars in
certain<00:01:15.750> matches<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.530> definitely

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
certain matches that would definitely

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
certain matches that would definitely
make<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.340> bit<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> mess<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.060> maybe<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
make it a bit of a mess and maybe in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050 
make it a bit of a mess and maybe in
orbit<00:01:19.229> overwhelming<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.830> times<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.909> for

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
orbit overwhelming at times but just for

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.999 
orbit overwhelming at times but just for
certain<00:01:21.240> matches<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> mentioned

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
certain matches like I mentioned

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
certain matches like I mentioned
especially<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> Rumble<00:01:24.180> hopefully<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
especially for the Rumble hopefully in

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
especially for the Rumble hopefully in
my<00:01:25.170> limit<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:26.009> work<00:01:26.280> fairly<00:01:26.580> well<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
my limit could work fairly well now a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
my limit could work fairly well now a
sense<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.470> games<00:01:28.710> originally<00:01:29.430> went<00:01:29.640> new<00:01:30.000> gen

short let me have one point in time on a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
short let me have one point in time on a
couple<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> older<00:01:37.650> games<00:01:37.920> was<00:01:38.549> slightly

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
couple of the older games was slightly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
couple of the older games was slightly
higher<00:01:39.210> potentially<00:01:40.170> eight<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.890> those<00:01:41.009> games

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
higher potentially eight on those games
