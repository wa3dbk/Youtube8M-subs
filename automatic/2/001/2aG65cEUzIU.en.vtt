00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.390
 to make a rose we need 6 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 such here are the same circle which 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.389
 can do with compasses that we 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.389
 make on we put a circle in half 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.840
 fold this way again 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.720
 that's what we did 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.650
 we do the same thing with everyone 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.380
 the remaining five circles 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.900
 that's what we've got further start 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.500
 collect a rose for soldering for this 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:54.610
 take 1 circle 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:57.559
 we take scissors we cut off all the rest 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:05.420
 can we say petals we too we 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:08.570
 but let's cut off the middle of no such 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:16.990
 distance we do with our every 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:22.420
 future petal what are we doing next 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.420
 where we cut to the middle 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.580
 glue 2 petals impose one 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.770
 on the other we glue what we do next 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:40.150
 take a pen and start rounding our 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.150
 petals this way inwards 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.850
 external case 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.430
 here 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.430
 somehow we turn on too 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.630
 This is a matter of peace states. 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.590
 next we take the second circle and doing 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.590
 with him all the same as sperm 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:57.670
 Here we got 2 blanks to 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:03:11.250
 Now we make cream and we can 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 basis so that's what we've got 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.010
 further format 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.030
 take our third billet and cut out 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.030
 one petal 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:39.109
 the remaining petals are also from Ryazan to 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:42.769
 I will do the end with every petal and 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:47.389
 do the same with 4 of 4 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.090
 blank here we got the door on 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:55.900
 blanks 3 and 4 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:59.329
 with them doing the same thing and we take 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.639
 paste one petal on the other 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.629
 we got four such petals 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.629
 glue 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.780
 that's what happened to us and now as in 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:35.430
 the previous two cases, we bend 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.430
 petals . 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.270
 Here we have a new procurement 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.430
 next we have them glued to ours 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.430
 ground first, then another 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:12.479
 we glue our our 4 base with shear 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.949
 so that the osprey petals are located 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.830
 that's what we do in the end we 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.259
 kill we fix it loosely here very 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.990
 beautiful rose 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:27.520
 take the last our base on 5 6 and 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.779
 We shall do not dare to be cut as 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.770
 on 2 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.770
 petal 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.749
 Compound peace. weights yet 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:59.610
 we already have 3 petals 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:05.910
 Here we have such blanks 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:09.690
 further rubles so do these petals 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.690
 with that it's ugly. 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.280
 Here we have such last 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.220
 billet and on the same principle we 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.220
 we will keep our core 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.810
 at 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.970
 Here we have such a rosette 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:45.540
 now we 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:48.510
 unravel the petals 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.460
 we got such a rose paper for these 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:54.060
 Roses are certainly better to take in color 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:07:01.950
 double sided rose 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:05.120
 there were more such leaves after all 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:08.340
 our music will be ready inside 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.000
 how such a rose looks in this case 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.000
 on crafts
