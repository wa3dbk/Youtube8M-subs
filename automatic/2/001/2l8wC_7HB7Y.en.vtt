00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's huge probably you'll get a better

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
it's huge probably you'll get a better
feel<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.410> looks<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:02.160> when

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

we<00:01:02.550> put<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.530> rampage<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
we put the rampage in there because it's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
we put the rampage in there because it's
an<00:01:05.970> extended<00:01:06.600> ATX<00:01:06.720> multiple<00:01:07.320> it'll<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.680> all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
an extended ATX multiple it'll go all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
an extended ATX multiple it'll go all
out<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:08.750> you'll<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
out to here and then you'll have the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
out to here and then you'll have the
radiators<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.030> i<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
radiators as well so when i get back and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.070 
radiators as well so when i get back and
do<00:01:12.840> another<00:01:12.869> install<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:15.540> put<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> proper

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
do another install to put the proper

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.679 
do another install to put the proper
parts<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.560> you'll<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> greater<00:01:18.000> idea<00:01:18.420> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
parts in you'll get a greater idea what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.499 
parts in you'll get a greater idea what
this<00:01:18.810> case<00:01:19.049> looks<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.790> chopping

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
this case looks like when it's chopping

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.630 
this case looks like when it's chopping

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
block pull the hard way so i've done a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.050 
block pull the hard way so i've done a
montage<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.310> looks

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
montage and of what this thing looks

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
montage and of what this thing looks

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.400 
that's like super dude that's pretty
quick<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.860> was<00:03:07.220> very<00:03:07.610> quick<00:03:08.290> alright<00:03:09.290> this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
quick that was very quick alright this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.699 
quick that was very quick alright this
is<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.680> setup<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.310> supernova<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
is the setup going supernova and the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.830 
is the setup going supernova and the
computer<00:03:13.040> itself<00:03:13.420> with<00:03:14.420> all<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.660> wires

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
computer itself with all the wires

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.839 
computer itself with all the wires
hanging<00:03:15.080> out<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.319> back<00:03:15.440> we<00:03:16.250> gone<00:03:16.400> for<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.580> clear

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
hanging out the back we gone for a clear

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.729 
hanging out the back we gone for a clear
motherboard<00:03:17.269> which<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:18.019> little<00:03:18.650> bit

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
motherboard which is a little bit

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.070 
motherboard which is a little bit
different<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:20.480> will<00:03:20.569> certainly<00:03:20.750> be<00:03:20.989> an

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
different and it will certainly be an

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.740 
different and it will certainly be an
option<00:03:21.230> when<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.560> put<00:03:21.709> out<00:03:21.830> on<00:03:21.920> sale<00:03:22.220> as<00:03:22.400> well

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
option when we put out on sale as well

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.350 
option when we put out on sale as well
so<00:03:23.750> now<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.459> for<00:03:25.819> an<00:03:25.880> electrical

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
so now this is going for an electrical

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.220 
so now this is going for an electrical
check<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.930> you<00:03:26.989> can<00:03:27.110> get<00:03:27.230> tagged<00:03:27.500> sunova<00:03:28.040> and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
check so you can get tagged sunova and

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.630 
check so you can get tagged sunova and
you'll<00:03:30.230> see<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> video<00:03:30.650> from<00:03:30.890> us<00:03:31.040> we're<00:03:31.370> doing

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640
