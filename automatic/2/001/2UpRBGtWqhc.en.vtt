 I will teach you how to release the phone 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.669

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.669
 movistar seal chip 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.280
 and this 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.590
 do not have any inconvenience 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.590
 the network profit well we start 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.640
 in the video description they were left 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.420

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.420
 the application is called the box success 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.410
 the discharge 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.970
 you can also find it in google 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.150

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.110
 description of the video

 and that is downloaded and installed 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.000
 we open the application 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 and he's going to ask us for superuser's permission 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 good 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.740
 which are to unlock them 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:19.150
 and good I'll show you what is the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.300
 trick so they can see if your lock 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 network is good if it is blocked 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.290
 network blocking here will appear 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.180
 one thing that is learned I already 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.180
 I have disabled that's why he tells me off 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 good 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.230
 we give him to accept we go out and open 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 the application 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.890
 what is galaxy tool box we open and now 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.770
 you know here permission of superuser 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.010
 remember to be good root as we have 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.819
 read all this we had this this 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.019
 stick fear and we give in this little window 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:32.209
 well here what we are going to do is make 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.100
 a backup of the bml 15 partition that is 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.400
 the second option 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.400
 we give him here and we give him know 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.079
 perfect here is already ready it does not take 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.970
 a lot of we left we give you back and you 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:56.690
 we put network a lock 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:01.840
 haha network in what I believe is the fourth 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.630
 we give him here and we give him here he comes out and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.240
 it automatically unlocks it 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.240
 ok we got out of here 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.410
 we left and what he proceeds to do is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.000
 restart the phone 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.000
 perfect, we turn it off 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.480
 this process does not really last long 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.190
 then wait until it is 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.190
 turn off the phone 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.090
 we turn on the phone again 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.470
 and we wait for him to load 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.900
 remember to be root users 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.310
 this takes no more than 2 to 3 minutes 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.580

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:24.390
