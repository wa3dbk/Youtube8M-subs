I'm going to check out a fault on a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.800 
I'm going to check out a fault on a
munchkin<00:00:18.000> boiler<00:00:22.640> there<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.760> go<00:00:25.099> see<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
munchkin boiler there we go see what the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:41.680 
munchkin boiler there we go see what the
what<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> deal<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.170> here

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.770 

the<00:00:41.960> pump<00:00:42.260> has<00:00:42.410> been<00:00:42.469> commanded<00:00:43.280> on

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.959 

and<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.559> running<00:00:47.660> but<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> boiler<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> not

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and is running but the boiler is not

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
and is running but the boiler is not
firing<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.809> can't<00:00:52.079> hear<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> we're<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
firing I can't hear it we're going to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.090 
firing I can't hear it we're going to
take<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.930> cover<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.620> what<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.920> deal

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
take the cover off and see what the deal

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.920 
take the cover off and see what the deal
is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.240 

okay

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.930 

if<00:01:13.250> that's<00:01:13.550> what<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.820> figured<00:01:15.640> f09

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
if that's what I figured f09

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.280 
if that's what I figured f09
fault<00:01:17.800> according<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.010> book<00:01:19.300> f09<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.870> flame

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
fault according to the book f09 is flame

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
fault according to the book f09 is flame
sentence<00:01:21.830> failure

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
sentence failure

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840 
sentence failure
so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.080> either<00:01:25.260> not<00:01:25.560> lighting<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.670> not

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so it's either not lighting or it's not

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
so it's either not lighting or it's not
detecting<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> flame<00:01:28.140> once<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.680> lit<00:01:28.950> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
detecting the flame once it's lit so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.680 
detecting the flame once it's lit so
we're<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> try<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.790> reset<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.570> we're

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
we're going to try and reset it so we're

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.810 
we're going to try and reset it so we're
going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> push<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> reset<00:01:31.650> button<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.280> I'm

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
going to push the reset button here I'm

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.800 
going to push the reset button here I'm
going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> watch<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:34.340> port

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
going to watch this port

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.550 
going to watch this port
as<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.619> light

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
as it light

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
as it light
oh<00:01:39.590> yeah

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
oh yeah

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.720 
oh yeah
gosh<00:01:42.990> lower

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.360 

here<00:01:47.880> quick

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
here quick

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.070 
here quick
is<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.940> gas<00:01:50.150> valve<00:01:50.540> open<00:01:52.660> see<00:01:53.660> if<00:01:53.720> we<00:01:53.840> see<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
is the gas valve open see if we see a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.350 
is the gas valve open see if we see a
flame

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.960 

come<00:02:01.870> on

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.979 

I<00:02:10.060> decided<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.320> doesn't<00:02:11.710> want<00:02:11.860> to

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
I decided it doesn't want to

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.890 

try<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.990 

ah

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.500 

so<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.540> can't<00:02:27.810> force<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.380> here

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:48.190 

there<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.170> goes
