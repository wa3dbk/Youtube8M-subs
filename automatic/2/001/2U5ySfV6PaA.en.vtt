00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.989
 and this is not just a choice there is some 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:05.370
 strict criteria for which Kiev where he 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.610
 could pass 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.879
 a year has passed 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.480
 on the last championship of Russia ranked sixth 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.639
 place this year played at a tournament 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.639
 in eastern europe 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.679
 what will happen now 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:24.819
 him 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.909
 with short program 5 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 Jan Sibelius 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 but 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 not 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.819
 all these words 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.679
 due to 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:36.540
 when a person 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.540
 decisive set now in Moscow in Alekseevskaya 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.059
 Russian Andrei Arshavin 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:45.379
 let's mark Michael honored but we know 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.679
 what's in this 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:50.579
 direct relation to the terrorist act 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.259
 respectively 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.899
 appreciating 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:55.869
 have worked 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.029
 whole team 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.619
 It seems to me that Ivan coped with anxiety 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.989
 of this tournament and all 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.009
 as stated six bodies he is not bad 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.209
 I skated for myself I think that 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.839
 he should be pleased 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.469
 he was small 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.639
 such help when after departure 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.139
 during a cascade in front of a triple sheepskin 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.109
 a lot of trouble that he 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.840
 went on that note 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.469
 executed first place 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.949
 Secondly, we played for the Moscow Ring Road. 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.029
 here is his triple axel 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.919
 the honor to play tactically 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 tomtom tons but nothing 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.129
 protection on 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.349
 Yes, and may the advantages of the post is what you do not 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.349
 the purpose of this volume as stated in the statement 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.639
 in Kiev 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.789
 he would not stand wrong 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:43.780
 not this way 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.319
 sometimes I wonder why athletes 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.300
 high level but able to pierce 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.830
 triple toe loop almost off 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.770
 and very often athletes don't 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
 solved and doing all the same in a cascade 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.199
 it is very important the ability to endure that 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.960
 and did not have time 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.469
 win mid august 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 before they are executed 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.139
 in combination in particular 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.710
 sometimes don't even think what element 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.490
 will be executed the same way 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.979
 automatic body clock in this in 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.219
 this second 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.599
 listen how do you rate 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.599
 but triple toe loop and also such a post 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.559
 very light element which 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.039
 at the level of guys who are now 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.619
 ride in the world of figure skating 

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:28.849
 center elementary jump which can 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.549
 put it anywhere in the program 

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:32.259
 perform 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.400
 and now bidding Wednesday 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.889
 and thatâ€™s how it seems to me 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.699
 by responsibility 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.289
 has stopped 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.229
 I am just next 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.139
 think yo i was jumping 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.229
 but this is life 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.529
 This is due to the fact that in the first zootechnics 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.050
 must be good of this particular element 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.050
 so he was sure that he was even without water 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.809
 he can execute this element 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.159
 semi final assessment look like an order 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.210
 still put the world of russia he gave 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.259
 understand girl counts individuals 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:00.710
 he has three more 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.509
 novosibirsk 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.330
 now pledge 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.919
 do you have a desire to eat 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.620
 the claimant demanded how to sit down it 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.279
 The biggest advantages here for this
