00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.500 

for<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:25.590> first<00:00:25.770> couple<00:00:25.950> of<00:00:26.070> years<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:27.030> sort

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
for the first couple of years they sort

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
become kitchen hands and we felt that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.040 
become kitchen hands and we felt that
there<00:00:31.680> was<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.860> opportunity<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:33.270> take<00:00:33.810> them

hardest<00:01:22.170> thing<00:01:22.409> here<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.490> find<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> most

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
hardest thing here that I find it most

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
hardest thing here that I find it most
challenging<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.870> you<00:01:25.530> know<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:25.979> you're

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
challenging it's you know what you're

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.069 
challenging it's you know what you're
doing<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.149> when<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
doing you know when you want to do this

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.990 
doing you know when you want to do this
the<00:01:28.289> outcomes<00:01:28.770> has<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the outcomes has to be like that and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
the outcomes has to be like that and
sometimes<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.289> doesn't<00:01:31.530> come<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sometimes it doesn't come out like that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.649 
sometimes it doesn't come out like that
because<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> guys<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:32.909> still<00:01:33.329> learning

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
