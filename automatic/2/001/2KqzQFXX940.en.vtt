you<00:01:45.780> gonna<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.439> idea<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.570> how<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.759> works

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
you gonna get an idea of how this works

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.490 
you gonna get an idea of how this works
well<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.680> hope<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:54.000> works<00:01:54.180> well<00:01:55.020> i<00:01:55.049> did

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
well of hope this works well i did

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.630 
well of hope this works well i did
actually<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.950> hope<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> work<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
actually kind of hope it work and I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.190 
actually kind of hope it work and I
didn't<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.000> last<00:01:57.210> time

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
didn't this last time

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.770 
didn't this last time
but<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.770> get<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.920> idea<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.549> the<00:02:01.539> way<00:02:01.659> it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
but you get the idea of the way it

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.209 
but you get the idea of the way it
basically<00:02:02.020> works<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.409> instead<00:02:03.100> of

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
basically works is that instead of

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.279 
basically works is that instead of
typing<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.090> tapping<00:02:04.509> on<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.659> keyboard<00:02:05.140> if

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
typing and tapping on the keyboard if

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.440 
typing and tapping on the keyboard if
you<00:02:05.799> want<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.039> type<00:02:06.219> say<00:02:06.520> hello<00:02:06.969> like<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.299> did

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
you want to type say hello like I did

for example are you going to do swipe

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.009 
for example are you going to do swipe
over<00:02:09.069> those<00:02:09.429> letters<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:11.730> h-e-l-l-o<00:02:13.019> round

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
over those letters so h-e-l-l-o round

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.390 
over those letters so h-e-l-l-o round
you're<00:02:14.230> gonna<00:02:14.290> make<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> little<00:02:14.650> loop<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.160> l

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
you're gonna make a little loop on l

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
you're gonna make a little loop on l
because<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.239> double<00:02:16.540> letter<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.900> then

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
because it's a double letter and then

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.150 
because it's a double letter and then
let<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.980> oh<00:02:18.190> ok<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.090> did<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.510> did<00:02:19.630> help<00:02:19.750> line

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
let go on oh ok so did it did help line

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.290 
let go on oh ok so did it did help line
but<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.370> basically<00:02:21.489> how<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.819> works<00:02:22.060> so

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
but that's basically how it works so

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030 
but that's basically how it works so
let's<00:02:22.540> do<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> more<00:02:22.959> complicated<00:02:23.260> word<00:02:23.800> like

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
let's do the more complicated word like

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.229 
let's do the more complicated word like
demonstration<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.730> did<00:02:24.880> for<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.060> guys<00:02:25.209> that

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
demonstration I did for you guys that

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.250 
demonstration I did for you guys that
worked<00:02:25.630> out<00:02:25.750> fine<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.650> de<00:02:27.040> mo<00:02:27.849> n<00:02:28.500> str<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.950> tion

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
worked out fine so de mo n str a tion

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.750 
worked out fine so de mo n str a tion
that's<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.709> saw<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.340> my<00:02:33.489> finger

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
that's it so you saw that my finger

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
that's it so you saw that my finger
never<00:02:34.060> left<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.360> keyboard<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.870> was<00:02:35.170> just

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
never left the keyboard I was just

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.309 
never left the keyboard I was just
literally<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.769> gliding<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.280> around<00:02:36.519> um<00:02:37.319> so

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
literally just gliding it around um so

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.229 
literally just gliding it around um so
that's<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.620> there<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.099> this<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> not

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
that's all there is to it this is not

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.789 
that's all there is to it this is not
new<00:02:40.510> technology<00:02:41.019> like<00:02:41.230> i<00:02:41.349> said<00:02:41.560> i've<00:02:41.680> been

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
new technology like i said i've been

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.550 
new technology like i said i've been
using<00:02:41.920> swype<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:42.450> well<00:02:43.450> as<00:02:43.690> long<00:02:43.870> as<00:02:44.049> it's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
using swype for well as long as it's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160 
using swype for well as long as it's
been<00:02:44.709> available<00:02:45.299> but<00:02:46.299> now<00:02:46.959> that's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
been available but now that's

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.449 
been available but now that's
implemented<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.799> stock<00:02:48.040> android

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
implemented in the stock android

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.759 
implemented in the stock android
keyboard<00:02:48.730> it's<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.299> nice<00:02:49.390> little<00:02:49.569> future<00:02:49.959> as<00:02:50.170> to

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
keyboard it's a nice little future as to

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.050 
keyboard it's a nice little future as to
whether<00:02:50.920> or<00:02:51.069> not<00:02:51.130> certain<00:02:51.640> phones<00:02:51.849> will

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
whether or not certain phones will

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.479 
whether or not certain phones will
include<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.780> say<00:02:53.049> Samsung<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:54.340> their

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
include this like say Samsung and their

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.140 
include this like say Samsung and their
TouchWiz<00:02:54.940> or<00:02:55.380> HTC<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.709> there<00:02:56.860> HTC<00:02:57.340> sense<00:02:57.579> i'm

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
TouchWiz or HTC in there HTC sense i'm

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.220 
TouchWiz or HTC in there HTC sense i'm
not<00:02:58.480> sure<00:02:58.660> if<00:02:58.720> they're<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.989> implement

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
not sure if they're going to implement

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.460 
not sure if they're going to implement
this<00:02:59.440> keyboard<00:02:59.769> in<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.980> future<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.140> a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
this keyboard in the future so it's a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710 
this keyboard in the future so it's a
hit<00:03:02.650> or<00:03:02.680> miss<00:03:02.799> however<00:03:03.519> Nexus<00:03:04.060> devices<00:03:04.389> will

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
hit or miss however Nexus devices will

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.360 
hit or miss however Nexus devices will
certainly<00:03:05.109> have<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:05.709> they're<00:03:05.980> able<00:03:06.220> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
certainly have it if they're able to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.479 
certainly have it if they're able to
upgrade<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:06.819> Android<00:03:07.329> 4.2<00:03:07.810> or<00:03:08.049> newer<00:03:09.040> they

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
upgrade to Android 4.2 or newer they

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.800 
upgrade to Android 4.2 or newer they
will<00:03:09.639> most<00:03:09.790> certainly<00:03:09.910> have<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.600> keyboard

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
will most certainly have that keyboard

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.650 
will most certainly have that keyboard
because<00:03:11.290> its<00:03:11.530> stock<00:03:11.680> Android<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.850> that's<00:03:13.450> all

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
because its stock Android so that's all

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
because its stock Android so that's all
there<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.079> if<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.739> want<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> know<00:03:15.040> how
