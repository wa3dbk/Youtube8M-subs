00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.390
 sets for work that are 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.680
 professionals I used to be one of those 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.490
 girls who at work always wore 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.220
 typical boring jacket suit is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.750
 typical bun very conservative very 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.170
 conservative and the typical pearlitas 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 you are also very conservative soft or 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 so very classic 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.320
 but you even saw the video 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.200
 shame 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.270
 work but with time it lasts me 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.539
 very much and I'm on point I'm very 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.250
 happy to be at a point where I no longer 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:57.000
 I'm ashamed to take chulitos to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 work does not give me does not give me thing 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 express myself in terms of my passion 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.510
 who am I what I like that is fashion 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.030
 at work because I realize that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.300
 I can still be very professional that 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.319
 but mix a little there of you can 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.900
 put a little bit of me there of mine 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:22.659
 of my personality in terms of failed 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.950
 a little more femininity I do not know I do not know 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.319
 as always what I want to say is that 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.900
 can be a little more feminine in the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.299
 work without having to mean that 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.170
 I'm going to do unprofessional because the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.569
 people are going to take it like this 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.239

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.980

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.670
 I work and I am still very professional 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.730
