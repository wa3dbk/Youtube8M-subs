00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
know what if you do this high fat stuff

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.680 
know what if you do this high fat stuff
you<00:00:43.050> can't<00:00:43.579> access<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:44.640> body<00:00:45.000> fat<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you can't access your body fat so you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
you can't access your body fat so you
got<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.170> moderate<00:00:46.649> note<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> do

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
got to do moderate note you got to do

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.940 
got to do moderate note you got to do
high<00:00:47.610> protein<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.260> like

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
high protein and you have to do like

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.270 
high protein and you have to do like
kind<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> mutter<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> low<00:00:51.329> fat<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.280> just

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
kind of mutter it to low fat and just

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.279 
kind of mutter it to low fat and just
like<00:00:53.430> low<00:00:53.730> tide<00:00:54.149> rates<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.020> women

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
like low tide rates and then these women

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
like low tide rates and then these women
go<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.190> gluco<00:01:00.030> neo<00:01:00.920> Genesis<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:03.149> start

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
go into gluco neo Genesis and they start

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.130 
go into gluco neo Genesis and they start
to<00:01:03.600> break<00:01:03.930> down<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:05.129> amino<00:01:05.580> acids<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.450> their

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to break down the amino acids in their

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.240 
to break down the amino acids in their
muscle<00:01:07.530> cells<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> protein<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> their

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
muscle cells or the protein in their

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
muscle cells or the protein in their
skin<00:01:11.640> or<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> bone<00:01:12.570> marrow<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.500> what

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
skin or the bone marrow to what

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.649 
skin or the bone marrow to what
convert<00:01:14.790> back<00:01:14.939> into<00:01:15.240> glucose<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.330> begin

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
convert back into glucose so they begin

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.770 
convert back into glucose so they begin
to<00:01:18.990> catabolize<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:20.729> step<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> scale<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to catabolize they step on the scale and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310 
to catabolize they step on the scale and
they're<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.080> oh<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.380> god<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> lost<00:01:23.340> weight<00:01:24.320> but

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
they're like oh my god I lost weight but

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
they're like oh my god I lost weight but
why<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.400> look<00:01:26.700> full<00:01:27.060> why<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.540> their

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
why do they not look full why do their

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
why do they not look full why do their
muscles<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.159> full<00:01:29.840> yes<00:01:30.950> why<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.670> they

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
muscles not look full yes why do they

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.890 
muscles not look full yes why do they
not<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.329> bubbly<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> genetics<00:01:35.900> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
not look bubbly is it genetics it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.859 
not look bubbly is it genetics it's
epigenetics<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:40.200> can't<00:01:40.650> build<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.810> to

epigenetics you can't build you want to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.940 
epigenetics you can't build you want to
be<00:01:42.960> anabolic<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.939> cannot<00:01:45.299> build<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
be anabolic you cannot build if you're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.120 
be anabolic you cannot build if you're
breaking<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> wanna<00:01:49.200> build<00:01:49.890> break

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
breaking down now you wanna build break

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.649 
breaking down now you wanna build break
down<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.700> bit<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:52.409> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> be

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
your protein too high what your body

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.339 
your protein too high what your body
cannot<00:02:13.560> use<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.519> convert<00:02:14.970> into<00:02:15.239> sugar<00:02:15.720> like

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
cannot use will convert into sugar like

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.650 
cannot use will convert into sugar like
BAM<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:18.720> you're<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.110> ketosis<00:02:20.660> you're

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
BAM now you're not in ketosis you're

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.619 
BAM now you're not in ketosis you're
brainy<00:02:21.959> needs<00:02:22.290> fat<00:02:23.269> because<00:02:24.269> your<00:02:24.420> brain

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
brainy needs fat because your brain

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.449 
brainy needs fat because your brain
thinks<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.110> starving<00:02:25.620> when<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.129> cut<00:02:26.370> out

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
thinks it's starving when you cut out

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.410 
thinks it's starving when you cut out
your<00:02:26.489> carbohydrates<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.799> what<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.430> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
your carbohydrates it is what it is to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.650 
your carbohydrates it is what it is to
make<00:02:31.519> beta-hydroxybutyrate<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.030> ketones

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
make beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketones

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.640 
make beta-hydroxybutyrate and ketones
you<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:33.959> you're<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> liver

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
you then you're a liver

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.530 
you then you're a liver
you<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.489> tell<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:35.970> brain<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.209> there's

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
you have to tell your brain that there's

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.250 
you have to tell your brain that there's
no<00:02:36.720> famine<00:02:37.110> by<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:38.130> boat<00:02:38.579> loading<00:02:39.120> we're<00:02:39.810> or

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
no famine by just boat loading we're or

no famine by just boat loading we're or
the<00:02:41.250> fats<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:44.160> eventually<00:02:44.599> your<00:02:45.599> brain

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the fats and then eventually your brain

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.839 
the fats and then eventually your brain
will<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:51.390> giving<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.900> fat<00:02:52.349> brain

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
will be like I'm giving you fat brain

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.610 
will be like I'm giving you fat brain
it's<00:02:53.849> like<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.060> don't<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.390> what<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:55.260> fat<00:02:55.590> I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
it's like I don't know what the fat I

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's like I don't know what the fat I
want<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.040> cars<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.620> high<00:02:58.799> protein<00:02:59.430> I'm

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
want my cars so this high protein I'm

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.960 
want my cars so this high protein I'm
gonna<00:03:00.209> convert<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.750> into<00:03:00.959> sugar<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:02.310> then

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
gonna convert this into sugar and then

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.190 
gonna convert this into sugar and then
you're<00:03:03.060> gonna<00:03:03.150> go<00:03:03.269> step<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> scale<00:03:03.959> and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
you're gonna go step on the scale and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.759 
you're gonna go step on the scale and
you<00:03:04.739> lose<00:03:04.980> weight<00:03:05.130> because<00:03:05.930> muscle<00:03:06.930> that's

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
you lose weight because muscle that's

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.280 
you lose weight because muscle that's
hep<00:03:08.130> that's<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.670> stuff<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.150> dense<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.139> is

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
hep that's that stuff is dense it is

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890 
hep that's that stuff is dense it is
heavy<00:03:10.639> so<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.670> lose<00:03:11.910> muscle<00:03:12.150> look<00:03:12.690> how<00:03:12.780> much

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
heavy so you lose muscle look how much
