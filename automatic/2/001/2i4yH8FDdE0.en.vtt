00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello today we go to make a car 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.589
 massage that relaxes the muscles of the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 neck and shoulders in this area here 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.590
 where same we are contracted because of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
 wrong postures that we assume on 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.029
 work or because we have been too much 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.710
 standing or why we slept 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.480
 bad or simply because we have 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 of concerns 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.599
 this self massage begins with one 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.460
 caress on the part follows a 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.070
 kneading of the whole area 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.710
 of the muscle and then we go to arrange the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 fingers along the course of this muscle 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 bigger than a trapezoid e 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 we maintain a constant pressure on 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.680
 this muscle as we inhale and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 exhaling we bring the head to the side 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.399
 opposite 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.049
 we throw out all the area we have 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 for apnea we remain a few seconds 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 when we can no longer do without 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.780
 inspire we take the air and come back to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:19.680
 new inspire and exhale hurry 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 we let the neck out sideways 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.880
 the whole area remains a few seconds 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.750
 in apnea 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.260
 then we come back 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.260
 it's still 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.439
 and return we take air and exhale 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.110
 we rotate the head 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.299
 on the opposite side of our muscle 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.880
 even here we let the whole area go out and 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.880
 we wait a few seconds to take it back 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.549
 again we continue to maintain 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:05.880
 constant finger pressure on 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.880
 our muscle once again 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.200
 and then breathing normally we do 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 some conditions in one sense and 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.780
 another 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.460
 before making one last caress 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.850
 one last cuddle years drain and then a 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.680
 release it now my 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.170
 shoulder should be a little bit more 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.020
 low I definitely stimulated the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.020
 circulation and muscle relaxed 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.580
 let's go and do everything on the other side e 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:53.770
 then we start again with a caress and then 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.959
 we knead we go to reposition the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.220
 fingers long course of the muscle 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.760
 we maintain a constant pressure 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.530
 we inhale and exhale we put the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.000
 neck always on the opposite side of the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.410
 Our hand remains in just a few 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.019
 second and then we return exhaling of 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.489
 new we stop throw it all out 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.330
 the area remains apnea 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.330
 as long as we can 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:38.420
 we repeat at least three times for each 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:41.870
 passage in and returns inspiro I go to 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:47.200
 rotate your head while I throw out 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:51.230
 the air remains in apnea a few seconds 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.050
 before returning 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.080
 it's still 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.080
 to 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.340
 there is one last time 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.290
 then I come back 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.050
 here again is that there is conduction 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.580
 in some sense there is some conduction 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.920
 in the other and finally I redo one 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.710
 little cuddle my muscle will be 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.720
 the last thing you will remember about this 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.860
 exercise for which tesco will observe 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.960
 a pleasant memory now shoulders 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.360
 they should have realigned 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.390
 certainly or very lightly 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 tension in no time at all 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.990
 exercise you can do even during 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.180
 a lunch break or whatever 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.560
 moment you feel with your back a lot 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.950
 contracted bye 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.950
 to the next
