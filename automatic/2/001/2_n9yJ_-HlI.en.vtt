00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.250
 today's recipe is a chicken with couscous 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.619
 Moroccan couscous is the one there 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.140
 of the north of Africa is different from 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.080
 our costs to me it is based on the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.500
 trio one week of cold and our cut 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.640
 and was chosen especially for the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.300
 one drumstick thigh skinless you this 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 product that comes and makes your day 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.180
 day 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.699
 we then take this thigh with 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.629
 and we make some some 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.460
 polite 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.109
 here I already have the right portion are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.109
 exactly 200 grams 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.140
 water flooded jaffé 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:04.770
 so I'll use it in the area of 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.660
 to make choice or cooking decision 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.410
 while the option is made 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.010
 I am a string of stringed olive oil 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.070
 here in front of him and I'm letting go 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.049
 a garlic an oil that I cut islamic 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 if there is a larger size 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:32.290
 a purple onion and certainly in an ace 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 higher laws and flavor and if this 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:43.479
 case is light golden 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.619
 I call here a neighboring block 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.299
 blue whiting 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.930
 if you do not have a house block you 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.420
 can use a low or another vegetable 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 of your choice 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:07.580
 and you lightly stir and saute the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:09.939
 targets already convenes assemblage of wheat sound 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:18.110
 caught 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:20.500
 a spoon two of the water that is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.230
 lose the chicken 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.560
 at that time our chicken has arrived at 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.610
 cooking point Sergio considered 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:40.270
 tap turning the other 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:48.240
 elé is skinless without the luxury of a thread 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:51.790
 oil so that the oil bring your 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.610
 taste for our chicken 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.050
 this tone we can play with it and 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.050
 if there has colorífico is a dye 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.380
 Spanish that already has in the market 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 easily if you buy and the shops 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.530
 specialized 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.280
 so when I use the dye you 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.640
 Can use your little I was return 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.640
 bleacher in the sense of looking for 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.959
 those tones that are coming here that 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.700

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.680
 chicken a little salsa and it's okay 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.129

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:42.930

 freshly ground and freshly ground 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.750
 oxygen does not steal the pepper aroma 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:36.979
 the kingdom is a big difference 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.979
