00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello and welcome to futurumshop so the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 poli grigio of the sealskinz extra cold 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 weather cycle blog 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.210
 the ideal gloves for cold and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.639
 wet weather conditions of shoes 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 have a certain degree of the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 thermal 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 so we need how your how 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 the better the gloves, the more 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 they keep up against t of a cold and the like 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.210
 the higher the rating so the high the degree 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.970
 will be 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 This one has five out of five so here it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 actually the most growing and most 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.740
 warm glove full for bad 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.740
 weather conditions 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110
 gloves can be opened through 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.750
 of velcro system 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.030
 nice extra insert so it's now off 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.210
 will not break if yes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 open close and the other means of the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 Velcro closure 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 the neoprene seems almost the the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.329
 wrist closes nicely so you can nicely 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 coat over so that the winter does not like 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.500
 will remain outside inside provided 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.469
 of gel padding for cushioning and a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.780
 extra comfort with fingertips 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.420
 of extra grip 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 the middle finger forefinger and your thumb 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 on the inside or outside and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 excuse 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.500
 provided with a piece on the outside 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.270
 meat or nie of a specific substance omni van 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 to sweat perspiration 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 will apply to a reflective here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.220
 element on the center of the glove 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.450
 just about now for better visibility 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.850
 and if I indicated we are the gloves 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.640
 wind and waterproof so actually ideal 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 for extreme weather conditions 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.729
 but can of course also just in the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.729
 fall and winter 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.500
 thereby you will have skins and bill 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 taken into account with a mechanism that they 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 can be clicked together as well 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.729
 sounds 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.729
 that makes him show 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.640
 and so the gloves will not 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.289
 stay well together and allowed it now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.149
 being in such a being can be as beautiful as being 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.219
 that set again a white cupboards 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.659
 that is also the profile of the sealskin 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.659
