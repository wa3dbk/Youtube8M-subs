00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:09.139
 This there is a pressurized product today is a specialty store or bookstore 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:14.360
 We will introduce a microphone for pu 4 c or a product. 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.309
 This round part that is written as a microphone on this microphone is a condenser here 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.100
 Mike is loaded 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.470
 Available only the I battery is when to use 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.490
 It is smooth when we go 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.529
 I will explain in order 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:35.420
 It is a battery but please prepare a square-shaped old bold battery 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:43.230
 The back of the housing of the microphone for this mosquito phone try to open, remove the screw 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:50.400
 The lower part I think you see this battery is inserted This battery will be the power 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.149
 Then let's connect There are 2 terminals, but use it with a guitar etc. on the round terminal on the left side 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.630
 is not it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.970
 Insert the shielded cable from the battery 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.900
 The power will be turned on and the sound will be output 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.710
 Please give me 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:11.590
 For another one of the terminals it can also be used at the same time 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:15.969
 Please use by connecting such as the mixer is inserted into the microphone cable 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.780
 You can now send sound to two occasions at the same time 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:25.909
 Next, I will explain how to use no battery 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.869
 It is possible to use this microphone by using the function called phantom power attached to the mixer 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.400
 is 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.950
 In that case, just plug the microphone cable into the mixer 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.800
 Then turn on the phantom power switch on the mixer 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.740
 The road you see now is a red button 48 Vol 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.950
 You can use this microphone by turning on the phantom power when you press the button that says 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.010
 If you look at the expansion , it is here 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:59.930
 It says a +48 v is the switch of phantom power 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:06.920
 Please be careful because you will be when you insert or remove noise when you turn the switch 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.700
 Very easy actually in the interior of the installation to try whether goods in the form of just put this way pop 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 is 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 Or also a Hey and I do not want that this microphone is shifted 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 cajon of live sound is like you can see, in the case that I do not want that would be. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:27.480
 Also I think it good that I am playing in place of it is the towel mute in the form or products 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:30.610
 As it is only put on the floor, it is for the item such as the base tube as you see 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.130
 Accessories can be used at the same time 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.300

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.400
