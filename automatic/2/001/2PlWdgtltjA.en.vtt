00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.730
 the polar center that is on the ocean 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:14.040
 then the wind that this polar mass 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.619
 produces a maritime and cold wind and this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.960
 cold and humid then spreading 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.869
 here in southeastern Brazil 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 gusts of wind will not even happen there 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 this week because this mass of air 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.500
 polar 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.380
 It will really gain strength. Get ready. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 also to feel even that sensation 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 of greater cold, precisely because of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.809
 cement 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:43.020
 Look what happens, we have it here. 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.020
 this Tuesday a cold front 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 which will already be reaching the coast of SÃ£o 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 Paulo 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.699
 this cold front will pass quickly 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 it can even cause some light rain 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 much because of this unit injection 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.390
 which occurs in areas close to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 Coast 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.880
 polar mass associated with this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.090
 cold front already comes with the value of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 1,030 hectopascals on the coast of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.080
 Argentina on Wednesday 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 cold front advances a bit more in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.229
 direction rio de janeiro to the holy spirit 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 and even coming close and Down south 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.979
 of the bay the polar mass of this cold front 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.659
 gains strength it reaches 1,036 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.770
 hector pascais this is a value of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 very strong pressure now the polar center 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.960
 is more intense and will continue to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 argentina coast 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 only in this position will you play those 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 cold winds here over Brazil 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.490
 so right here on the coast of Argentina 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.829
 which is a very strong polar center we 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 let's go to a popular pressure center 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.619
 very big right? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.310
 we'll feel these icy winds 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.619
 arriving here and there the result 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.320
 When you have then and here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.810
 also in the 30 hour only to those winds 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.660
 are gaining steam 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.510
 So we'll have it during this is the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.569
 end of this week 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.370
 this large injection of polar air on top 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.430
 from the south center of brazil 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.760
 renewing this polar mass that is already 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 around here
