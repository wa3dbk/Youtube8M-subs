00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 and the question of the whole world and the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 fear is yes yes if you are going to change 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.950
 we always said the same thing what is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 well we will try to sustain them we will see 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
 what can we contribute as 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.879
 technical staff 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.670
 and we consider that to be 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.790
 change 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.070
 we are not equal gustavo in his body 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.410
 technical and humility we 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.110
 We will try to look like ourselves and be of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.090
 way 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.830
 closest to what they are doing in 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.660
 how much to change after each one has 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.330
 his philosophy changed the way he trained 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.360
 change the oratory there are some things that 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.950
 we are not two people equal obviously 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.810
 that we would like to look like and achieve what 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.570
 same 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.040
 but good when there is a change is the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.890
 word well says it there is a change of 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.809
 we will not try to adapt to what 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.110
 what is the campus and from there 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.390
 start doing and improve if possible 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.990
 be these things we always think that 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.420
 you have to improve not 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.910
 that is the idea of ​​the human being trying to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.220
 each day be a little better good 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.440
 first what attracted us to come 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.280
 even towards Ecuador accept our 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.750
 proposal is a bit the whole structure 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 What does emelec have ? 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.110
 from the year 2011 that we 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.820
 we communicate with nazif there we met 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.550
 telephonically 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.680
 one started to get a little swollen and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.040
 after I could not come in that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.760
 moment 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.340
 followed through those years and good 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.620
 one does not fail to take into account the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.230
 structure that the club has today and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:43.480
 obviously the team what has achieved 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.000
 8th quinteros through these years and 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.210
 good when this possibility appeared and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.430
 because gustavo I'm still in the national team 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 good seduced him enough and today we are 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.860
 here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 with respect to yesterday's game good 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.510
 obviously that being in a classic like 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.760
 It's Barcelona where we were going to lose 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.550
 possibility of seeing it and with respect to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.800
 match the truth that I 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.970
 the frame the people 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.250
 and especially in the triumph of emelec we 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.100
 he has been very happy 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.050
 the fact of having come and see a 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.010
 emelec party and especially this 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.959
 magnitude 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.480
 well this thanks him he mentioned that the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.069
 frame of soleá pleased him was the moment 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.450
 ideal as to get a moment 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.310
 precise yes yes yes a just right moment 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.250
 already hosting people's line to 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 through the twitter account 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.650
 obviously we know that the requirement 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.690
 very high but it is a nice challenge and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.239
 we want to be prepared 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.480
 We will try to collaborate so that the 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.890
 campus continue with this desire with this 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 motivation that you see that you have 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.489
 boys and good to be able to collaborate 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.590
 our place 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.000
 so that these children and from the point of 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.560
 amateur view because they are said 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.060
 that has already become a fan 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.430
 from the team through the years 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.870
 from the amateur point of view that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.870
 It pleased her that it caught her attention 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.960
 of the team and me in the attitude of the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.250
 players the attitude they have for 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.650
 each party wins or not 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 the commitment that they have to the truth 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.660
 which is something that is noticeable from the outside 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.220
 and well I think it must be a pride 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.370
 for the coach they can direct a 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.070
 group that is mentalized in the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.050
 objective and to demonstrate it within 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.370
 the court whatever the result I 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.050
 I think that's the biggest victory 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.350
 what can a coach have 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.330
 the team is aware of what 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.240
 to do and perform after 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.030
 the result is an accident but now 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.620
 Being a good team of 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.300
 follow-up that has already been done 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.450
 through television images 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.660
 what player attracts him to play him 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.150
 like 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.880
 we can name miller bolaños 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.210
 obviously today in Milan since he maybe 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.580
 be 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.530
 the most stand out but not stopped 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.300
 look at everything from a team a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.720
 coach 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.500
 look at a whole still in operation 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.390
 from herrera to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.609
 the current stock boys in defense 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:24.460
 bus changes yesterday 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.740
 by the power and a lot of players 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.930
 there are many there are many of pedro quiñones 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.660
 there are very interesting players that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.300
 they hold a structure and from 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.160
 there obviously, maybe the strawberry of 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.750
 dessert as we say we are the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.580
 air germ 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.920
 the year is also climbing mondaini 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.169
 much narvaez with the others I think that 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.389
 there is 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.999
 we try to look more at what is 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.069
 what is the group in general not so 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.680
 less we are that we focus 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.099
 much we all know that they play 11 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.870
 some go to the bank another does not have to be 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.729
 but we believe that we are a technical team 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.749
 that we try to look at the whole inside 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.749
 a campus
