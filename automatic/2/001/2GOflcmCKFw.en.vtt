believe it or not the line has

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
believe it or not the line has
definitely<00:00:19.289> come<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> long<00:00:19.920> long<00:00:20.340> way<00:00:20.490> since

waste<00:01:38.869> fits<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.079> nicely<00:01:43.820> got<00:01:44.820> jumping

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
waste fits really nicely got jumping

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.550 
waste fits really nicely got jumping
right<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> spine<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right here on the back of the spine to a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.530 
right here on the back of the spine to a
gate<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> traction<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.729> thumb<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.210> well<00:01:48.270> as

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
gate in traction of the thumb as well as

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
gate in traction of the thumb as well as
in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> finger<00:01:48.990> choil<00:01:49.140> area<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> back

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
in the finger choil area this is a back

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.030 
in the finger choil area this is a back
lock<00:01:52.799> design<00:01:53.390> with<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:55.969> stainless<00:01:56.969> steel

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
lock design with a stainless steel

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
lock design with a stainless steel
spacer<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> back<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.299> that's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
spacer in the back and I think that's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.700 
spacer in the back and I think that's
where<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> weight<00:02:01.200> comes<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
where a lot of the weight comes in is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.120 
where a lot of the weight comes in is
all<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.979> steel<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> back<00:02:03.210> end

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
all this steel that's in the back end

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
all this steel that's in the back end
the<00:02:05.130> knife<00:02:05.280> has<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> pivot<00:02:05.820> bushing<00:02:05.969> system

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the knife has a pivot bushing system

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.770 
the knife has a pivot bushing system
which<00:02:07.290> makes<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> action<00:02:08.670> buttery<00:02:09.420> smooth

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
which makes the action buttery smooth

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.850 
which makes the action buttery smooth
and<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:11.009> spring<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.670> not

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and the spring is not

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.890 
and the spring is not
not<00:02:13.010> too<00:02:13.160> tough<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.490> overcome<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.570> it's<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> very

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
not too tough to overcome so it's a very

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.640 
not too tough to overcome so it's a very
comfortable<00:02:15.080> knife<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.560> operate<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:17.650> little

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
comfortable knife to operate a little
