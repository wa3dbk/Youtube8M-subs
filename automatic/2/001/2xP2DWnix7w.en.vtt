is the fact that one it's got tons of
really<00:01:21.080> really<00:01:21.440> awesome<00:01:21.710> games<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.430> they're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
really really awesome games that they're

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
thing is the little analog stick on it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.600 
thing is the little analog stick on it
looks<00:01:26.510> like<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:26.930> very<00:01:27.830> reminiscent<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.549> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
looks like it's very reminiscent of the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.460 
looks like it's very reminiscent of the
one<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.030> they<00:01:29.120> used<00:01:29.299> on<00:01:29.450> in<00:01:29.630> Neo<00:01:29.870> Geo<00:01:29.960> CD

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
one that they used on in Neo Geo CD

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.490 
one that they used on in Neo Geo CD
controllers<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:32.360> they<00:01:32.510> used<00:01:32.750> on<00:01:32.990> yes

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
controllers and that they used on yes

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
here if you've never gone to mess with

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.149 
here if you've never gone to mess with
the<00:01:38.150> analog<00:01:38.479> stick<00:01:38.510> on<00:01:38.869> here<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:39.320> awesome<00:01:40.010> it

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the analog stick on here it's awesome it

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.640 
the analog stick on here it's awesome it
really<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.909> like<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.659> quite<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.900> bit<00:01:41.990> but

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
really is I like this quite a bit but

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.170 
really is I like this quite a bit but
anyhow<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.340> looks<00:01:43.580> like<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.760> will<00:01:43.880> be<00:01:44.000> really

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
anyhow it looks like it will be really

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.180 
anyhow it looks like it will be really
good<00:01:44.299> knife<00:01:44.570> liked<00:01:45.080> older<00:01:45.320> hardware<00:01:45.530> overall

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
good knife liked older hardware overall

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.800 
good knife liked older hardware overall
any<00:01:46.400> time<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.729> they<00:01:46.880> release<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.180> handheld<00:01:47.570> or

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
any time that they release a handheld or

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.330 
any time that they release a handheld or
console<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.439> always<00:01:48.560> thought<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.860> was<00:01:48.890> top<00:01:49.130> on

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
console I always thought it was top on

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.270 
console I always thought it was top on
stuff<00:01:49.670> despite<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.510> fact<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.869> was<00:01:51.049> usually<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
stuff despite the fact it was usually it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.649 
stuff despite the fact it was usually it
really<00:01:52.850> really<00:01:53.060> expensive<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
really really expensive with the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.969 
really really expensive with the
exception<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.110> their<00:01:54.260> hand<00:01:54.439> held<00:01:54.650> her<00:01:54.770> hand

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
exception of their hand held her hand

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.280 
exception of their hand held her hand
holder<00:01:55.189> was<00:01:55.280> very<00:01:55.549> affordable<00:01:56.000> but<00:01:56.540> hey<00:01:57.080> how

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
holder was very affordable but hey how
