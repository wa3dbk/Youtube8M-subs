00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:35.190 
key of G we're gonna play a little
arpeggio<00:04:23.980> based<00:04:24.310> lick<00:04:33.570> we<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.720> fire<00:04:34.930> off<00:04:35.170> a

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
arpeggio based lick we can fire off a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.050 
arpeggio based lick we can fire off a
chord<00:04:35.620> right<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:35.980> front<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.310> those<00:04:36.430> as<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:36.880> go

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
chord right in front of those as we go

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.110 
chord right in front of those as we go
up<00:04:37.270> from<00:04:37.570> G<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:38.110> A<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.710> B<00:04:38.920> so<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:39.610> might<00:04:39.850> sound

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
up from G to A to B so that might sound

00:04:40.120 --> 00:05:16.760 
up from G to A to B so that might sound
something<00:04:40.510> like

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.930 

all<00:05:17.770> right<00:05:17.919> so<00:05:18.129> we<00:05:18.220> have<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.520> one<00:05:18.759> other

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
all right so we have this one other

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.610 
all right so we have this one other
weird<00:05:19.300> little<00:05:19.629> lick<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.050> we<00:05:20.139> have<00:05:20.319> to<00:05:20.470> get

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
weird little lick that we have to get

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.439 
weird little lick that we have to get
that'll<00:05:20.979> bring<00:05:21.069> us<00:05:21.220> back<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.669> C<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.270> D

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
that'll bring us back to the C to D

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:31.930 
that'll bring us back to the C to D
punches

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.790 

so<00:05:32.940> it's<00:05:33.090> actually<00:05:33.270> like<00:05:33.570> an<00:05:33.900> arpeggio<00:05:34.440> out<00:05:34.680> of

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
so it's actually like an arpeggio out of

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:54.590 
so it's actually like an arpeggio out of
an<00:05:34.920> a-minor

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.970

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
all right so we're close to the end we

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.550 
all right so we're close to the end we
got<00:05:57.100> our<00:05:57.280> C<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.550> D<00:05:57.760> punches<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.840> Terrapin<00:05:59.350> lick

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
