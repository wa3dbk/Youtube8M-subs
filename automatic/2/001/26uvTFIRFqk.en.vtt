do<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.439> one-day-only

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
do if not they can make a one-day-only

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.819 
do if not they can make a one-day-only
invariant<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.930> make<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.229> permanent<00:01:55.439> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
invariant all I can make it permanent I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
invariant all I can make it permanent I
don't<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.579> instead<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.939> having<00:01:57.060> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
don't know so instead of having just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.749 
don't know so instead of having just
your<00:01:57.719> two<00:01:58.500> variants<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> IMP<00:01:59.520> i<00:01:59.700> do

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
your two variants of the IMP i do

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.170 
your two variants of the IMP i do
believe<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.689> obviously<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> all-star

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
believe which obviously for the all-star

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
believe which obviously for the all-star
obviously<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> could<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.990> leprechaun<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
obviously you could have a leprechaun so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
obviously you could have a leprechaun so
