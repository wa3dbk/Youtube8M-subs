00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.730
 Let's now talk to the fake turci reporter of four bandits or 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:07.090
 I'm not going in this region. 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 baker timely operator 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.809
 after this agreement is watching and already the movement of aircraft taxi cab 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.909
 here in congonhas we already observed 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.970
 at least five aircraft two of them 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 They have already taken off here. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.850
 we observe and that the planes are using until this moment just in the runway 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.640
 of congonhas which is smaller about 500 meters smaller because the track 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.399
 main 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.890
 the main one was precisely the one that gave origin 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.830
 to the accident was today is the devil used the plane that ended up crashing 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.050
 with the building 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.110
 barton the double folded avenue we observe is now one of the headwaters of the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.360
 It was precisely on this part of the main congonhas lane that the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.850
 plane went out to the building on the other side of the avenue we tried to go 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.580
 to see any braking mark on the aircraft or even any mark on the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.410
 indicating the deviation from left to right as he left the 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.810
 distance from the track but from that distance that we can not observe in a 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 sign and then to the left then the end of the head of the main 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.380
 Congonhas 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.700
 and we observe then 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 the smoke eva and leaving the place of the accident the place that remains 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.050
 still built 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.710
 for a few small outbreaks of fire 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.940
 fabÃ­ola main track of congonhas 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.620
 which is operating at this time the lane was auxiliary is not the main 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.830
 we will show in these two clues and important information 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.050
 because the main runway just suffered 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.120
 a series of reforms is the first clue you see there 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.040
 in the center of the screen this main lane there in the background at the top of the screen 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.830
 started badly but disagrees 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.090
 darker asphalt ciliary piston 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 this main track 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.340
 should contain a dream dumb 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.710
 it's not that coaches call it a ball 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.290
 already helping to brake the plane 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 before retirement this auxiliary lane is 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.330
 by standing position then using airplanes at this moment I wake up with 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 borges 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.280
 with these aids help to brake the plane mainly 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.099
 when the track is wet 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.969
 the lack of these students before the reform of the tarmac asphalt 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.479
 athletic-go if closed several days 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.199
 this time 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 the finished work the cells have not yet been made 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.799
 two days of a wetland plane 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.329
 slipped skidding on that track 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.889
 monteiro printed the talks between pilots and control 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.269
 air traffic controllers 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.899
 gerson warns the mind that the runway was causing aircraft skidding 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.429
 Let's talk to expert engineers. 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:47.730
 in air transport ecological park of the polytechnic school of usp 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.050
 engineer jorge e 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.379
 loyal measured 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.079
 you would say that I am an accident announced 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.690
 from this third part of the pantanal plane and from so many conversations yesterday 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.310
 and a controlled crewmember that the lane was slippery is a good clue 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.890
 that a good good indication that your team should find out what happened to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.639
 question that gets is more important tactic 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.839
 for taxpayer to the sides air transport graer why is it not 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.229
 congonhas airport 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:17.269
 these track tests already paul being needed more than two years ago 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.799
 because they were placed in a loss of secondary in relation to 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.040
 the expansion works of the passenger terminal either because first 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.459
 terminal passenger dead and stuck to the track for which privileges the sap 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.859
 to the detriment of safety and why they have not made new 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.439
 adventures that resulted are either made or concrete has a cure or to the flooring that 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.540
 few chorus for life 45 days so he can receive smaller ones so that they 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.939
 remain open 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.539
 our sure candidate the question and the river 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.279
 always the person is that in his understanding 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:55.009
 braking there may have been a problem 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:04:00.650
 braking the plane because in his grasp the plane would have ah would not have achieved 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:04.969
 brake and then went to the left the moment he left the track 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.349
 hugo foto ap not having achieved 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.619
 may have certainly been caused by the cousin himself we do not know 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:20.129
 but she swam at the time at the time of the accident to fake now the fado and tested 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.489
 a month 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.049
 and he lost control of the plane 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.770
 about trying to steer away from a wooden horse but we do not know we have to 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.410
 listen why do I talk to the pi-peaks when the black boxes day and the fourth 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.169
 detained person 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.900
 now surely this lack of humility she must have contributed the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.740
 accident started before the secitece accident 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.410
 when the lane had not yet been informed of 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.819
 three bagged for having interdicted 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.670
 and not now 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.280
 in fact I think that there was even a regularity of provision 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.270
 this regularity only here regularity was corrected the lack of shots 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.250
 and for whom it operates vasconcellos and for the location of the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.750
 congonhas airport in the capital and simulated by the city very close to 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.169
 homes 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.520
 conditioning is that of number of landings and takeoffs you would say 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.310
 it was a bit of how it is doomed or it should continue to function as 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.599
 it is 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.529
 this led by rabbit steps as the father he is able to meet 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.539
 the population demand 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.110
 what has to be done by our authorities on the part of the company 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.449
 responsible for the total of the necessary strengths effective rainfall 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.780
 for example is what I am afraid that today are classified by the 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.370
 port due to the accident 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.159
 which may have been avoided 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.050
 to other places with soldiers of the world that she can succeed with the city 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.090
 I have the full conviction of our city of rio de janeiro 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.090
 or you can get out of there is the person who comes back has water 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.080
 what tells 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.210
 Monday of this week 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.430
 somehow a controller alerted the pilot 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:53.249
 and see what he said 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.309
 art 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960
 We talk boring now without success. 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:08.119
 The Brazilian day. 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.619
 acs 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:12.029
 the sociologist
