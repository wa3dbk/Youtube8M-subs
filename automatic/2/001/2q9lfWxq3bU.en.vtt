00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.310
 are when we return with a 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.320
 new video tutorial on how we 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.350
 we can recover files and asia as 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 images sheets of the outside document 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.000
 kim all kinds of files inclusion 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.780
 music that somehow you guys 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.260
 have removed from some device 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.040
 Well, this flash memory can be 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.200
 be hard 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.210
 and among other devices 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.980
 storage that they have removed from 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.100
 accidentally 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.680
 or suddenly you have eliminated or 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.300
 then you then you do 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.180
 urgently need that file 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.480
 for this and a solution I will use a 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.940
 software called usb retrieves this 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.129
 program allows you to recover all kinds 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.910
 of files from any device 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.220
 of storage since I have used 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.200
 several times and it has always worked for me 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.210
 because I was able to recover all the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.630
 deleted files 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.150
 accidentally deleted well for 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.070
 we are going to download software 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.270
 do not worry about the download link 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.270
 I leave in the description of the video 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.100
 enter the link or the link and wait 5 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.479
 seconds so they can put the button 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.479
 to skip advertising 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 we skip advertising 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 and wait 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.780
 to download the latest version I do not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
 I'm going to download it because I already have it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.180
 downloaded on my desktop well when 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.470

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.760
 once when you execute the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.040
 program from your desktop the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.470
 questions what kind of records that will be 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.840
 recovery in case if you want 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.959
 to be images can be music for being 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.010

 of the following 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.580
 He also asks you from what unit 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.660
 you want to recover the said file well 7 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.660
 memories you can specify 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.319
 one of those options or if not where it says 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.920
 in a specific prison in this case 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.200
 I will choose 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 well before I'm going to erase so that you 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.409
 same 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.880
 well from to see I'm going to copy a file 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.010
 to unit 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.680
 storage what is my pendrive 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.680
 to see I'm going to know the file 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.420
 copy 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.860
 and I'm going to paste eyes that this pendrive with 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.760
 account account here 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.239
 and I have a file called 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.569
 here in good marketing company is a 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.569
 pdf 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.510
 I'm going to proceed to eliminate it for 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.110
 subsequently retrieve it to do 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.170
 a test 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.550
 then right click deleted it I give it 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.050
 yes 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.710
 yeah 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:01.910
 now I close then I will choose here 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.640
 it will not have to be from where I 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.110
 you want to recover 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.819
 I select except in the next good 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.680
 if you like it you can activate what 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.270
 which is to disable deep scanning 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.560
 but in this case not because since it is a 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.520
 specific file that you want to recover 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.520
 I give to start 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.050
 Y 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.660
 this is where the last ones appear 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.290
 files that have been deleted 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.050
 what is my storage memory 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.970
 pendrive 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.800
 this is the last file that has been 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.990
 removed 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.190
 but first they must create a writing and a 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.710
 binder 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.240
 any any normally case 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.760
 I'm going to put recovered files 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.720
 records 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.700
 recovered well me once when 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.680
 I find because these are all my 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.350
 files that have been deleted from that 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.100
 memory once when I find my 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.790
 file that I was looking for 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.150
 I selected was going to recover and I choose the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.880
 destination where you will recover in this 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.710
 case they are recovered files I look for this 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.930
 binder 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.030
 there the son and I will accept and close 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.969
 we can imitate 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:28.489
 and I'm going to this folder 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.489
 and here is my file if I open it 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.630
 good is a pdf there is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.830
 there is my file as you can see well 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.530
 that has been all good remember that this 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.440
 program serves you as long as you 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.780
 you have not formatted the drive 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.630
 storage now what happens if you already 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.450
 have formatted 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.100
 maybe you are obviously not going to 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.490
 retrieve the file name but 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.770
 moment when you are this open from 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.520
 suddenly this one designates a damaged file 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.410
 but there are times it opens out there in some 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.500
 cases there are times already and I have not 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.320
 this one worked 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.430
 after having formatted memory 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.250
 recomposed this application recovers all 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.810
 the files and well the file comes out 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.030
 It is already damaged 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.560
 thankfully times the files are fine 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.560
 and this has been all for today 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.340
