00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
 It is clear she is really terrible I think I must then always lousy 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.790
 Plug Jobbik what is also the TuS at the moment 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.279
 Sourceforge we also have coal that's great 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.379
 I think your leaves are not enough now 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.999
 yes, too 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.659
 I think it is quite good that will be yes with Tectura Precht and 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.089
 choose better 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.310
 so 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.310
 We still cut the Herforder off 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 just watch that we are in Solothurn 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 that does help me personally too much shade 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.270
 and if we come up with some engines or McAdam jeans with dirt 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 Find form 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 of course, the benefit team is putting into action so I really want to 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.650
 Blankfein 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.380
 Premiere as a percent 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.180
 Sony install the tour are nature editor 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910
 I think it's just beautiful 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.020
 bad rks also follows what was to decorate exactly what 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 for more and more years 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.900
 i just say normal looking so yes too children 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 and that's why we stay here Neutral learn it 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.510
 this was last with 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.190
 I would like to have the foundation later I thought about it 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.400
 Install Cologne at the POS last 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.810
 but I think Queenstown it already looks right movie theaters as the name suggests 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090
 I think you can leave that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.850
 without hesitation 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.560
 and could start now a bit boring as unique as 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.660
 said that you have to build your knowledge 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.710
 and I have to set myself apart first or barks a bit 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.870
 but if that one is both feasible we can do it once 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.090
 go out a little bit 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.160
 and dinners have isolated why acute what we do 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.300
 Dante's part for the advertisement a bit longer so I'm going to do ten 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.069
 Minutes for free 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.400
 I should do it now 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.120
 Butcher and felt three times 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.570
 that is exactly when my part is over and when the next one 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.029
 that is not so easy to be chopped off right in the middle of the sentence 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.989
 because that's not the point 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.569
 and if he does then 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.269
 are outside 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.319
 We can also write a little bit about Japan 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.489
 says the student that is 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.819
 if it was dangerous a bit the world fit Map, of course, it is like 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.809
 build that one then the group needs 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.489
 whatever you could build so I'm already thinking about it 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.729
 Of course, he now prefers day-winner with Diamonds Game 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.109
 from me 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.109
 but well 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.389
 it should be true so far 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.789
 the blanket pieces really a bit 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.449
 and there would be a bit of something to see from outside 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.179
 high political slogan 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.909
 we always do it 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 that was sooner rather 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.059
 it warrants Cobblestone why fight back 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.759
 if enough in the course of the game 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.759
 We do not need to deal with children with such modesty 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 Here the ball jumped on the corner 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.669
 and of course in costume children have to 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.429
 yes, I'll do it right now until then should be so for Bechtle 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.429
 risk so Plischke 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.059
 of course we return 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.749
 Spanish football is the city council Stracke 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.439
 on the other hand I thought so 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.439
 and it's already getting dark and the protest is bundling 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.779
 Sighing, there are a few things to be tinkering with 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.439
 and flora 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.209
 what can I say 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.259
 it's getting dark 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.259
 and that the Pope is using now 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.769
 I'm wrong 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.040
 that's neither 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.159
 allegedly advises Prof 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.479
 then everything is in butter 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.489
 and now will have problems and facts 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.729
 320 piglets country list wrong that we could get something born 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 The day before yesterday Polo can not be any better 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.939
 and then I say market trend 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.999
 we are getting good morning 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.759
 Now we are back and let the cool us-boys in the saying and 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.039
 Culture 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.580
 Scooter Brown if at the same time at the next best opportunity bid 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.439
 Fleischmann bedroom 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.439
 that the usual is in the middle of the room above 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.849
 and we even have something left over, Colao 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.400
 of course this will be improved in the next time 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.479
 It takes a while for us to have it as its basic structure 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.469
 really 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.469
 does not look bad 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.869
 h at the beginning is how you know it and that he professes himself 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.949
 that the parishes testimonies of the Claas is not yet open at the moment 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.970
 Brown does not have to be on the market I can actually look what a year off 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.379
 that will not work 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.739
 Jakob van Noten's call to be welded together 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.270
 what could we have in the cinema what a nice 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.960
 the promi- first me 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.960
 The coal is almost always a pleasure to use 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.789
 the leather and the probably groups in office is 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.979
 and it can always be used 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.509
 But the fact is still a fine balance at the moment so nothing made of wood build great 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.620
 and the flowers Lotter makes it later perhaps dyes comfort or threatened 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.389
 Well, maybe I want to do something Russian 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.740
 I think I was a bit too wanted out there 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.629
 if you know that so well 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.629
 and I put Merci in the beginning and in trees 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.150
 life is Juliet
