00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
sure that I replicated as closely as I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
possible to get all the pipes on because

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.179 
possible to get all the pipes on because
it<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.480> quite<00:01:00.840> crowded<00:01:01.280> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> actual<00:01:02.760> model

it<00:02:20.780> does<00:02:21.140> come<00:02:21.470> off<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.760> careful<00:02:22.940> it's

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
it does come off just be careful it's

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.290 
it does come off just be careful it's
very<00:02:23.810> very<00:02:24.260> stiff<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.740> start<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.180> know

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
very very stiff to start and in you know

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
very very stiff to start and in you know
it<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:27.260> shows<00:02:27.620> all<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.830> gearing<00:02:28.069> inside<00:02:28.459> with

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
it it shows all the gearing inside with

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.390 
it it shows all the gearing inside with
lots<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.090> grease<00:02:29.709> then<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.950> allows<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.280> to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
lots of grease then that allows you to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
lots of grease then that allows you to
slide<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.880> NEM<00:02:32.300> coupling<00:02:32.840> out<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:34.060> its<00:02:35.060> socket

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
slide the NEM coupling out of its socket

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
slide the NEM coupling out of its socket
there's<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.650> socket<00:02:36.890> remaining<00:02:37.430> there<00:02:37.610> but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
there's a socket remaining there but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.920 
there's a socket remaining there but
there's<00:02:37.970> no<00:02:38.120> nem<00:02:38.540> pocket<00:02:39.319> in<00:02:40.000> there<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.870> you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
there's no nem pocket in there so you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.000 
there's no nem pocket in there so you
can<00:02:42.260> fit<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.370> snowplow<00:02:43.910> by<00:02:44.830> gluing<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
can fit the snowplow by gluing it to the
