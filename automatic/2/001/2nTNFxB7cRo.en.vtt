00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.680
 astrid mÃ¼ller is my name i have in 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.810
 aachen a company able to move for 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.309
 training and counseling mainly in 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.520
 area leadership development and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.230
 conflict I am random 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 Coaching came because I keep coming back 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.300
 looking for innovative 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.550
 interesting methods that simple and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.140
 Quickly depict what man recognizes 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.280
 would like to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.230
 the interesting thing about working with 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.390
 horses is that you have no judgment about it 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.160
 have what we want to achieve or 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.900
 which goal we have, they give us 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.900
 simply blunt the feedback 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.080
 They react directly to that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.229
 I, as a human being, are a source of inspiration 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.420
 when the impulse is clear and clear 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.270
 The horse responds clearly and clearly 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.920
 if I'm hesitant now and not 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.810
 I know where I go really long now 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.250
 then the horse will show me that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.220
 with which it stops, for example 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.720
 or simply stubborn or indulged in 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.040
 another direction does not apply any 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.450
 intellectual think rey but it is 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.150
 Just do a how do I get the horse 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.720
 about the obstacle and the just without 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 forced and there is so lay for me 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.400
 one of the keys because then i like it then 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.130
 in which you saw in the look 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.560
 okay that's really interesting now because 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.100
 It really is that I have my goals 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.740
 not attractive designed point 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 I vary individually depending on 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.840
 question the exercise in this case 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.850
 the three horses stand symbolically for 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.790
 the coordination and coping 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.590
 different everyday tasks which I 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.590
 Now it would be exciting if you could 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.130
 she becomes a bit more relaxed 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.209
 is out of must make an effort 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.380
 to deal with these three aspects and 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:24.590
 then let's see if you can handle it 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:28.730
 So it came at some point 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.380
 actually so that the horses the the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.850
 different aspects in my life 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.890
 have shown that the palpable 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 and then I could start to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.850
 for example, the length of the strike 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.709
 vary thereby sorted themselves 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.350
 always new and it was really the feeling 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.970
 as if the aspects of my life are up 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.220
 then also re-sort so if I 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.200
 a horse had more space then came 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.549
 I feel calm when I ride the other horse 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.519
 I noticed more space like this 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.290
 just got faster and that was up 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 now always a theoretical size and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.290
 it is by working with the horses 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.970
 just become very concrete here and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.970
 as a picture it is anchored in me 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.530
 This one would also be suitable in the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.090
 work with groups eg for team coaching 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.150
 and I would like you with the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.020
 get in touch a little bit three times 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.000
 Max looked ok with went 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:44.150
 is there so and then you are looking for the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.610
 purely from the three out through the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.410
 same task can be seen as with 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.310
 different styles of leadership 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.310
 horse is added 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.840
 but the participants can watch 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.410
 how gestic a posture and 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.270
 presence affects the horse a new 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:19.459
 direction can give a lot 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:23.630
 difficult task is a completely different one 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.340
 interactions break me back so that 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.880
 is only in an interaction what 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.800
 compassion to do with body language 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.710
 yes that makes it a lot of interesting 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.450
 actually a normal seminar in 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.520
 These group exercises are all 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.900
 Participants depend on each other because they 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.730
 connected with a knit 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:05:22.820
 they have to face each other 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:05:24.530
 hiring in the group has that too 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.880
 another very different dynamic 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.740
 so much coaching I find really very 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.570
 very interesting very exciting 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.070
 reaction of the animals the body language the 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.780
 body tension and even if you have a lot 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.160
 knows that you have to turn back animals 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.960
 and of course no way that drives and 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.720
 so on, that's something else 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.130
 if you work so intuitively and have to 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.090
 as soon as one has to react 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.740
 actually not the possibility 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.120
 to pretend and the companions 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.010
 not understood anyway the 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.020
 Show your emotions that say yes 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.960
 I forget with or 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.400
 there you just can not count 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.320
 that's why it's so exciting 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.010
 I only recommend this type of bio 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.450
 feedback I find really exciting 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.950
 He also made me curious 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.440
 would also like our realistic 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.130
 team see how they behave then 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.180
 would in his team so exercises yes i 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.920
 It definitely was a great find 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.880
 Concept and I would compliment too 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.730
 Involve you as you do and 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.090
 inviting you can do that with home 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.090
 lives
