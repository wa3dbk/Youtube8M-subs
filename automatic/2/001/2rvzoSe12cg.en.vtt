00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Creatin is proven to be one of the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.569
 most effective supplemente to 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.340
 muscle building and straight at 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 short-term very intense 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.929
 stress is creatine for many 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 bodybuilder 1 of the base supplemente and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.039
 from my point of view one of the best 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.470
 supplemente the one as strength athlete 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.770
 heitz natural bodybuilders 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 can 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.269
 Nevertheless, there is a lot 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.490
 myths and say around creatine the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.490
 pot the church in this video 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.340
 creatine is doping who of you has that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.110
 I've heard of it myself 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.150
 remember when I first my first 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.340
 pot creatine brought a pants 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.510
 I 'm about 17 years old 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.520
 Mum I said I bought myself 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.260
 Creative of it, the muscles are thick 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.239
 and she immediately said no that is 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.440
 but doping and has a girlfriend 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.640
 asked and the friend knew 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.320
 of course also very good 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.330
 notice and there must be something on it 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.660
 that is doping and what also 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.940
 always 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.220
 how often even say and lay 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.660
 The whole but often contains such a 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 small spark truth to us though 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.399
 in fact there are some or there were 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.020
 some associations the clouds on creatine 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.000
 set the doping list due to the 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.460
 fact that the effect of creatin 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.200
 about studies is provable makes 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 However, therefore, none are for one 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.979
 because it is simply in use with us 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 for over 20 30 years as well 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.330
 there are long-term studies and the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.399
 side effects so and what's doping 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.350
 usually makes something illegal 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.869
 because it's just negative on the body 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.270
 has side effects that is creative 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.640
 not the case so what's up so creatine 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 is definitely not a doping 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.080
 You can not use creatine and caffeine 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.340
 combine 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.780
 who of you has heard that before? 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.729
 I know that it gives me some 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.260
 recently under a facebook picture 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.900
 I have written this 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.850
 creative bcaa powder and a cafe 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.259
 I always post that in the morning 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.520
 me for sober then to training too 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.450
 go and then actually wrote me 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 someone down 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.130
 you must know that you coffee and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.650
 do not combine creatively 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.810
 may this myth foot on that 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.909
 Creatine water in the muscle cells 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.039
 you know our muscles 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.200
 consists for the most part of the water 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.840
 that means muscles are water when you are 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 so wants and the coffee that leads the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.430
 Body caffeine too and caffeine dehydrated 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.330
 the mistake in the thing is following 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.580
 the caffeine is indeed dehydrated but 200 300 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.470
 milliliters of water are supplied 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.120
 means in plain text a coffee 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.550
 does not drain the body but water 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.380
 leads the body to water you can 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.540
 so wonderful a caffeinated 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.400
 drink and creative together 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.400
 combine if you want to do it 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.040
 You only take creatine in the form of a cure 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.440
 to itself that of course myth for it 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.900
 There is no reason why you are a creatine 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.970
 settle after six or eight weeks 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.530
 it does not harm you so you have to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.240
 The body somehow already has to 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 it is not hormonal so the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.660
 body has to start again 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.000
 to produce any hormones 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.680
 Otherwise everything else will be fed 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.780
 is not that why there is none 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.160
 basic creative after six or after 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.380
 to sell eight weeks 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.660
 Of course you can do it but it is 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 just as possible creatine just continue 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 increase and continue to benefit from it 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.650
 that's just the anaerobic power 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.810
 the power improves that is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.420
 in the clear text Kreatin you can if you 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.440
 wants to be permanent as well as in shape 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.440
 take a break 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.700
 creatin draws water and in one 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.140
 By definition, you have to be creative 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.599
 settle every case 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.420
 There is no reason why you are a creatine 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.500
 in a defined phase must settle 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.689
 But on the contrary 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 you could even argue that way 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.859
 creatine creatine phosphate store in the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.629
 feels muscles and that it is straight in 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.239
 a diet just in a definition 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.829
 phase is very important on the 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.379
 other side of course when it comes to it 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.849
 goes on the scale to lose weight 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.620
 then that has an advantage if you 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.690
 creatine takes out because it's her 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.060
 actually water in the muscle cells 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.430
 but that has nothing to do with it 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.500
 that you get fatter or something but 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.930
 it's just about the muscle cells 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.549
 and not around the fat cells and right there 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.350
 So the difference is for someone who 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.729
 for example at the box competition under 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.470
 come to a certain weight limit 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.660
 must be creative for that purpose 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.280
 sell it off even faster 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.289
 decreases if that just around the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.910
 optical shape is that someone says 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.860
 I do not want to look puffed up 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.180
 He can continue to work with Kreatin 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.789
 because it is only with the muscle cells 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.789
 and not to do with the fat cells 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.539
 creatine is allowed 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.180
 take at least 18 years, at least 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.860
 this is a bastard myth altogether 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.990
 honestly because the manufacturers write 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.300
 is often not on it for children and 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.680
 not suitable for teenagers 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.810
 Adolescents are one to the perfect 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 So eighteenth daly from then 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.960
 one grows up then happens in the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.539
 body but not abrupt why 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.280
 you are only then sensitive to creative 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.830
 or sensitive is that is more naked 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.610
 mischief because you can as well with 16 or 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.860
 17 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.419
 experience this effect of creatin like 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.069
 just with 18 or 19 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.470
 Nothing happens in the body because of that 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.910
 somehow yes only from this moment 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.860
 can benefit from it 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.690
 So would any sources would want 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.520
 the whole rationally purely scientific 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.190
 Consider the same for the same 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.930
 possible even with 14 15 already creatine too 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.490
 take on the other side I think 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.650
 just fair and honest as someone 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.360
 just such things also sold promise 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.550
 from 18 years you are full 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.380
 You can work for at least 18 years 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.210
 Do whatever you want with your money 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.409
 if you want to take creatin beforehand then 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.139
 At least talk that to your parents 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.210
 about how I said between jane 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.190
 want to have that only from 18 years 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.110
 creative may take that before it 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.849
 dangerous or whatever is there say 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.849
 I honestly, there is no such thing 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.510
 for Kreatin one needs a so-called 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.210
 transport matrix because without transport 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.990
 matrix never gets into creatine 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.270
 teeth 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.200
 Creatin is very good in and of itself 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.210
 available 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.760
 even first does not disintegrate as fast as 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.070
 There are some manufacturers of one thing 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.040
 similar creatine and in plain text too 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.110
 its critics have claimed it 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.690
 there is nothing to do so in contact with 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.310
 Although creatine decomposes liquids though 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.350
 very very very slowly 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.240
 if your creatine is empty in the morning 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.340
 stomach will take you then you will 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.660
 just record very well if 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.400
 you combined with the whole 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.930
 carbohydrates then it can be over the 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.430
 Insulin belch a bit more 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.140
 go better but it does not make a giant 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.180
 big difference if we are three now 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.610
 gram with transport matrix or five 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.380
 gram without transport matrix is at the end 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.810
 the whole jacket like pants it just works 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.030
 because the creatine phosphate stores 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.010
 in the muscles are always bulging 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.320
 and it works just fine 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.320
 without transport matrix but also with 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:59.529
 creatin is simply the creatine 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.509
 Buy cheapest because that included 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:03.419
 always the same that is unfortunately not 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.679
 quite right there are definitely 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.629
 quality differences in purity in 

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:10.659
 the fineness in the graining there is 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:12.849
 Differences about 80 90 percent of 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.319
 the creatine that sells in germany 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.479
 is from china 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.249
 Of course, there are some differences 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.959
 I always recommend you a good one 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:21.939
 You just have to buy quality 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:24.579
 what you have what you your body 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.949
 feed the creature seal, for example 

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:29.379
 the first manufacturer in Germany 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:30.610
 has produced and still produces 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:32.529
 now also from different 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.209
 Manufacturers always available on the 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:36.789
 Eighth creature seal is for example 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:37.959
 a good possibility otherwise not on 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.179
 the wrong end save the 

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:42.129
