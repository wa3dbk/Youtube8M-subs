mini-nuke<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.299> quickest<00:00:15.660> way

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
mini-nuke this is the quickest way

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.900 
mini-nuke this is the quickest way
Mike's<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.130> take<00:00:17.220> his<00:00:17.369> knife<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.760> there

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
Mike's going to take his knife in there

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.519 
Mike's going to take his knife in there
and<00:00:18.000> he's<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> trace<00:00:18.900> around<00:00:19.109> that

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and he's going to trace around that

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890 
and he's going to trace around that
frame<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> then<00:00:20.789> he's<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> put<00:00:21.330> yarn

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
frame and then he's going to put yarn

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
frame and then he's going to put yarn
around<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.769> we've<00:00:22.859> got<00:00:22.980> too<00:00:23.130> many<00:00:23.279> frames

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
around it so we've got too many frames

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.040 
around it so we've got too many frames
what<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.449> size<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
what we want to do is size it up and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
what we want to do is size it up and
make<00:00:25.140> sure<00:00:25.170> we've<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.439> enough<00:00:25.590> wax<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.430> for

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
make sure we've got enough wax for for

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.490 
make sure we've got enough wax for for
both<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.750> mindful<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> fact<00:00:28.349> that

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
both but be mindful of the fact that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200 
both but be mindful of the fact that
this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> top<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.460> frame<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
this is the top of the frame here and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
this is the top of the frame here and
the<00:00:31.109> cells<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.529> angled<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.460> towards

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the cells are angled you know up towards

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.240 
the cells are angled you know up towards
the<00:00:32.910> top<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.870> can't<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.290> orient<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the top so you can't just orient it this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
the top so you can't just orient it this
way<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> upside<00:00:37.050> down<00:00:37.200> or

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
way or you know and upside down or

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
way or you know and upside down or
anything<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> respect<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> so

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
anything you want to respect that so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.600 
anything you want to respect that so
we're<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.829> 4en<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.399> as

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
we're going to 4en it the same way as

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
we're going to 4en it the same way as
the<00:00:41.790> whole<00:00:41.940> frame<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.629> bar<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the whole frame with top bar up here so

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.290 
the whole frame with top bar up here so
I'm<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> line<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.730> down<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.149> cut

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
I'm going to line it up down here we cut

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
I'm going to line it up down here we cut
a<00:00:45.329> couple<00:00:45.539> cells<00:00:45.870> down<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
a couple cells down here you can see it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
a couple cells down here you can see it
will<00:00:47.340> line<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.180> make<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:48.690> I've

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
will line it up over here make sure I've

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.090 
will line it up over here make sure I've
got<00:00:48.840> enough<00:00:49.200> over<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:49.920> one

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
wax so you just get the knife in there

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.179 
wax so you just get the knife in there
and<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.140> work<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.740> bit<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.040> the

and you work it a little bit on the
edges<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.299> it'll<00:02:03.420> cut

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
edges just like this and it'll cut

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
edges just like this and it'll cut
yourself<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.590> support<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
knife in and that allows it to drop down

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.580 
knife in and that allows it to drop down
see<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.489> pretty<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:10.080> drops<00:02:10.379> down
