Sponge Cake with Dulce the Leche

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.666
For you who know me, know how much I love dulce de leche!

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:15.275
When I received these sponge cake mixtures from Fleischmann, I thought "why not

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:16.345
make a dulce de leche cake?"

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.481
It goes a lot of dulce de leche and it's so tasty!

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:32.618
To make this cake I'll need 2 packages of sponge cake mixture from Fleischmann, 10 eggs,

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:37.637
Yes, 10 eggs, there's a lot of eggs so the cake will be very fluffy and delicious.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:44.598
And 240ml of whole milk. I'll put everything into an electric mixer and beat for 10 minutes until it's very fluffy

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:49.805
and homogeneous. While that I'll grease and line my 3 baking trays because I'm going to split this batter

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:54.391
into 3 trays of 21cm for you who ask about it.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:04.829
As soon as the batter is finished, split in 3 tins and bake to 180ËšC for approximately 30 minutes

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.397
or until you insert a toothpick in the middle and it comes out clean.

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:17.387
My cakes are ready and while they cold down I'll make the dulce de leche mousse.

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:21.951
I didn't want to use just dulce de leche because I think our cake would be too sweet,

00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:26.481
so I decided to add some fresh cream on it, because I think

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:28.177
it gives a better texture and flavor.

00:01:28.177 --> 00:01:33.991
For that I'll need 3 gelatin leafs, hydrated. If you don't have it you can use 8g of gelatin powder,

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:40.350
but then you click here to learn how to hidrate gelatin.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.567
I'll put these gelatin leafs to hidrate and as soon as they're ready I'll dissolve them in a small pan.

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:52.394
If you don't have enough thecnique, do this in a bain marie.

00:01:57.308 --> 00:02:03.443
Here I have 2 pots of high quality dulce de leche, which is approximately 860g of dulce de leche.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:09.327
I'll beat this a little bit with an electric mixer just to add some air and avoid this to be too heavy.

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:15.667
I'm going to set this dulce de leche aside and make 300g of whipped cream,

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.837
which I'll combine later with gelatin and dulce de leche.

00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:24.821
But before that, I'm gonna give you a tip: when your gelatin is hydrated, you add some dulce de leche inside

00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:30.629
the gelatin and stir, because it will be easier to incorporate this gelatin on the dulce de leche.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.774
First, add the gelatin in the dulce de leche and then the whipped cream doing that proportion you know already:

00:02:36.774 --> 00:02:43.552
add 1/3, stir well and add, then, the others 2/3 of whipped cream.

00:02:43.552 --> 00:02:48.029
When you add 1/3 of the whipped cream, you make the cream softer and not that heavy,

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:54.279
and then when you add the second part, is just to not loose the air of mixture.

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:11.949
The cakes are lovely and ready, now is just cut and equalize the 3 of them with two fingers height.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:22.804
Now is that thing: I'll arrange the cake inside a removable bottom tray, with the acetate

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:27.886
that I taught you how to to use here and here, so you can click and take a look there.

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:33.883
Just arrange the acetate around the tray. I put a layer of cake, first, and then a little bit of mousse,

00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:36.923
a layer of cake, mousse and cake.

00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:43.481
I'll take this to the refrigerator for 8h and let the cake rest so the gelatin can be nice and cold.

00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.653
You can wet the cake, if you want to, and for that I would tell you to make a sugar syrup with

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:55.074
1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar. You just combine both and let them boil for a while, and when it's cold

00:03:55.074 --> 00:03:58.382
you use to wet your little cakes.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:13.042
As you can notice, I think I overdid the cake mixtures.

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:14.766
Moustache: Just a little bit right, love?

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:17.282
A little bit. Just the double of it.

00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:23.581
Make just one recipe of cake. So, 1 package of cake mixture.

00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:26.620
You can keep with the mousse amount...

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.442
Moustache: Or you can make two and eat now and then.

00:04:29.442 --> 00:04:33.991
Or... Here's the hint! Make two and eat with coffee.

00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:38.612
Well, now I just have to unmold the cake and sprinkle some icing sugar on top,

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.003
just to make a simple decoration.

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:46.729
I'll decorate with 2 little flower buckets. I think it's better to cover the stem with tinfoil, or if you want this to last longer,

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.973
if you're making a wedding cake, for example,

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:58.499
you can keep the stem in a glass tube,

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:04.079
and then you add water so the flower will last, and insert the tube inside the cake.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.237
It's much easier and they last longer.

00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:25.105
This was my dulce de leche cake for you. I hope you make it in lots of weddings

00:05:25.105 --> 00:05:28.332
and celebrate life with it, too.

00:05:28.332 --> 00:05:33.130
