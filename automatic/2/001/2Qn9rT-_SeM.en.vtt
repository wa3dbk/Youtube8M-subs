a<00:03:23.670> sealed<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.359> your<00:03:24.480> protection<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> have

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
a sealed for your protection so you have

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.339 
a sealed for your protection so you have
to<00:03:27.450> take<00:03:27.859> your<00:03:28.859> tweezers<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:31.170> don't

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
to take your tweezers and so you don't

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.400 
to take your tweezers and so you don't
know<00:03:31.620> what<00:03:31.950> color<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.670> gonna<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.290> until<00:03:34.290> you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
know what color it's gonna be until you

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.690 
know what color it's gonna be until you
take<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.829> tweezers<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.870> lift<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.049> off<00:03:37.700> so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
take your tweezers and lift it off so

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.110 
take your tweezers and lift it off so
you<00:03:38.730> can<00:03:39.090> probably<00:03:39.329> see<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.340> even<00:03:41.880> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
you can probably see this is not even a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.420 
you can probably see this is not even a
duplicate<00:03:43.079> color<00:03:43.380> because<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:43.919> blues

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
duplicate color because that blues

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.420 
duplicate color because that blues
lighter<00:03:44.819> that's<00:03:45.419> darker<00:03:46.109> that's<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.919> purple

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
lighter that's darker that's a purple

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.099 
lighter that's darker that's a purple
that's<00:03:47.730> that's<00:03:48.480> more<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> royal<00:03:50.389> so<00:03:51.389> so

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
that's that's more like a royal so so

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.449 
that's that's more like a royal so so
far<00:03:52.440> I'm<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.099> pleased<00:03:53.549> I<00:03:54.290> paid<00:03:55.290> forty<00:03:56.220> five
