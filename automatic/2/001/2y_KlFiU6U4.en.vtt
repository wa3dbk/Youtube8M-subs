00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.250
 hello I enjoy a forest outing for 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.060
 introduce you to the taf of ti cats de 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.430
 moon again it's a product 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.020
 which is delivered in the form of a moon in a 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.400
 little bag bag this time 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.650
 it's a bag that will not stay 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.420
 hanging on late especially at 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.500
 others we've seen already inside 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 when we have a little pouch in 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.510
 which we will find two peaks and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.630
 pretty sturdy and yellow plastic 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.540
 the inter which weighs 660 grams and which makes 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.850
 3 meters 58 surprising 58 and we're going 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.210
 mount shaped diamond auctioned in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.399
 diamond above our mount xamax 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.040
 on the four corners of the seams 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.079
 reinforced here a small strap which one 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.390
 will see the utility just now and a 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.730
 cord so of course on a 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.700
 waterproof carpet with seams 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.100
 reinforced tightly also and that's the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.430
 particularity of not requiring two 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.899
 umbrella 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.320
 we will directly tie the strings 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.360
 on trees and five green colors that 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.500
 agrees well with nature so for 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.479
 attach it to the art several solutions 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.520
 according to the knots known to the co 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.550
 mastering raise do some kind of our 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.360
 costs the former here that is relatively 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.890
 solid it will suffice yet on this side and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.300
 I'm going to do the opposite and 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.319
 then we'll see to serve 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.319
 possibly from this system 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.530
 So here is a carpet is really 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.810
 spacious 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 of a served then I designed and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.200
 supplied with come planted in the ground 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.000
 to stretch the side of the tarpaulin 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.330
 we always planted his woodpecker and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.190
 across not all right in the earth 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.810
 so using a pebble from a hammer 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.009
 or happy knife and then this 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440
 which is really interesting is I 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.110
 you spoke just now 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.619
 and if this system so if I was not 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.819
 tense enough just to shoot 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.530
 to adjust or it's too tense 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.820
 we just released a little bit 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.380
 little bit of pressure 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.050
 so that's really a big plus for 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.530
 the final setting is complete 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.760
 generous area all along we have 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.150
 also off the hook here to hang by 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 example a headlamp 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.600
 during the night or something else if we go 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250
 just have a drink at the edge of the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.840
 beach we can play on the incline 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.450
 pine as needed 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.600
 the sun or the rain the color blends 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.280
 well in the decor here is a product 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.959
 simple and effective that I invite you to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.519
