00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.730
 welcome to auto sports for the test of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.980
 the continental then gtc at bentley ya 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.230
 different levels of power v8 dice 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.840
 speed w12 since gt3 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 in this case we are in this model of 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 speed that means it's 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.220
 to be the most powerful of the range but 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.699
 it does not necessarily mean it's the most 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.699
 bad choice 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.460
 kapo 24 years huge w12 of 6 liters 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.220
 against one of the biturbo myths of 4 and 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.120
 with enough powerful and above all 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.120
 the shot 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.460
 the other good surprise is the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.800
 behavior since we no longer have the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.489
 standards v12 and its anvil roof placed 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.309
 on the front brake 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.079
 the v8 and all light the distribution of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.510
 masses between the axles is better 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.510
 and in the end the discomfort was equal 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 and casually it changes your mind since 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 with this new agility and this 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 balance there continental can adopt a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.160
 higher pace without giving 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.160
 the impression of wallowing 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.860
 it also allows to vary the pleasures 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.229
 from cruising to cadence 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.729
 slightly higher performance side in all 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.490
 case we do not feel to regress 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 with the v8 whether in acceleration 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.880
 for 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.770
 in the end we see that 8 aces and one 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.810
 excellent choice 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.100
 so we do last ten that double v12 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.100
 is equally powerful
