look at the actual product so yeah this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
look at the actual product so yeah this
is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.500> biggest<00:00:58.710> hardest<00:00:59.250> Titans<00:00:59.699> have

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is the biggest hardest Titans have

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
is the biggest hardest Titans have
released<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.359> far<00:01:00.660> being<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> trenzalore

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
released so far being the trenzalore

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
released so far being the trenzalore
TARDIS<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.820> compare<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
TARDIS and if we compare it to the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
TARDIS and if we compare it to the
previous<00:01:03.660> versions<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
previous versions you can see the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
previous versions you can see the
difference<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.270> obviously<00:01:06.659> we've<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
difference so obviously we've got the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
difference so obviously we've got the
standard<00:01:07.590> 3<00:01:07.830> inch<00:01:07.860> TARDIS<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> right

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
standard 3 inch TARDIS on the right

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.420 
standard 3 inch TARDIS on the right
there<00:01:09.140> 6.5<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> middle<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
there 6.5 in the middle and the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
there 6.5 in the middle and the
trenzalore<00:01:11.700> 8<00:01:12.090> inch<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> end<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> have

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
trenzalore 8 inch at the end and I have

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.380 
trenzalore 8 inch at the end and I have
to<00:01:13.619> say<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> does<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.310> good<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.210> look

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
to say it does look good and they look

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
to say it does look good and they look
nice<00:01:15.570> lined<00:01:15.900> up<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> might<00:01:16.650> display

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
nice lined up like this I might display

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.080 
nice lined up like this I might display
them<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.240> shelf<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> looking

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
them like this on the shelf so looking

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
them like this on the shelf so looking
at<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> overall<00:01:21.659> paint<00:01:22.020> applications<00:01:22.680> on

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
at the overall paint applications on

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.649 
at the overall paint applications on
this<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.220> they're<00:01:24.030> pretty<00:01:24.240> much<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> same

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this one they're pretty much the same

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
this one they're pretty much the same
all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.140> way<00:01:25.259> around<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
all the way around actually with this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.910 
all the way around actually with this
damaged<00:01:26.909> defect<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.630> windows<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.680> only

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
damaged defect and the windows the only

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.590 
damaged defect and the windows the only
difference<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> front

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
difference is when you get to the front

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.380 
difference is when you get to the front
we've<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.829> TARDIS<00:01:32.460> handle<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> their

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.969 
we've got the TARDIS handle and their
little<00:01:33.509> handle<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.049> key<00:01:34.200> locks<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.799> on

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
little handle there and key locks now on

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
little handle there and key locks now on
the<00:01:35.070> bottom<00:01:35.460> we've<00:01:35.970> sort<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> got<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the bottom we've sort of got this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.380

graveyard effect which is not that clear
actually<00:01:39.810> but<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.079> does<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> work<00:01:40.799> but

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually but it does kind of work but

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.950

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the box is exactly the same as before so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.309 
the box is exactly the same as before so
let's<00:02:50.019> get<00:02:50.140> out<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.530> look<00:02:52.049> so<00:02:53.049> it's

doctor<00:02:55.390> figure<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.079> I<00:02:56.170> was<00:02:56.319> really<00:02:56.500> intrigued

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
doctor figure and I was really intrigued

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.830 
doctor figure and I was really intrigued
by<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.280> whole<00:02:57.400> bad<00:02:57.640> wolf<00:02:57.940> thing<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.599> time

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
by the whole bad wolf thing at the time

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.420 
by the whole bad wolf thing at the time
it's<00:02:59.109> a<00:02:59.200> shame<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.530> payoff<00:02:59.799> for<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.159> wasn't

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it's a shame the payoff for it wasn't

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's a shame the payoff for it wasn't
better<00:03:00.579> but<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.180> like<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.569> scene<00:03:01.780> where<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:02.049> see

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
better but I like the scene where we see

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.780 
better but I like the scene where we see
it<00:03:02.319> graffitied<00:03:02.769> across<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.159> TARDIS<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:03.670> it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
it graffitied across the TARDIS so it's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.970 
it graffitied across the TARDIS so it's
nice<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.000> have<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.629> Titan<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.379> that<00:03:05.560> just

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
nice to have a Titan of that just

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.130 
nice to have a Titan of that just
comparing<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.579> two<00:03:06.819> obviously<00:03:07.629> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.959> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
comparing the two obviously this is the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.660 
comparing the two obviously this is the
more<00:03:08.290> recent<00:03:08.440> TARDIS<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.400> got<00:03:09.579> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
more recent TARDIS because it's got the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.190 
more recent TARDIS because it's got the
st.<00:03:09.819> Johns<00:03:10.030> Ambulance<00:03:10.150> sticker<00:03:10.659> but<00:03:11.049> it's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
st. Johns Ambulance sticker but it's

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.240 
st. Johns Ambulance sticker but it's
nice<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.379> have<00:03:11.769> two<00:03:12.129> different<00:03:12.609> variants<00:03:14.250> but

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
nice to have two different variants but

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.460 
nice to have two different variants but
