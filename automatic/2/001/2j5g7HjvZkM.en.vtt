hey<00:00:01.560> guys<00:00:01.770> it's<00:00:02.040> Troy<00:00:02.250> here<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.639> video

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hey guys it's Troy here with a video

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.849 
hey guys it's Troy here with a video
explaining<00:00:03.179> what<00:00:03.629> bunny<00:00:03.840> hopping<00:00:04.140> or<00:00:04.470> fire

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
explaining what bunny hopping or fire

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.829 
explaining what bunny hopping or fire
hopping<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.730> technique<00:00:06.150> has<00:00:06.299> many<00:00:06.569> names

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
hopping is this technique has many names

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.509 
hopping is this technique has many names
the<00:00:07.200> funniest<00:00:07.500> I've<00:00:07.740> heard<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.099> definitely

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the funniest I've heard is definitely

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.730 
the funniest I've heard is definitely
frogging<00:00:09.030> pretty<00:00:09.599> sure<00:00:09.870> IGN<00:00:10.260> came<00:00:10.469> up<00:00:10.590> with

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
frogging pretty sure IGN came up with

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.209 
frogging pretty sure IGN came up with
that<00:00:10.860> one

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
that one

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.580 
that one
but<00:00:11.730> yeah<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.360> technique<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.080> pretty<00:00:13.440> much

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
but yeah the technique is pretty much

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.930 
but yeah the technique is pretty much
pressing<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.160> direction<00:00:14.610> while<00:00:14.790> you're

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
pressing a direction while you're

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.730 
pressing a direction while you're
boosting<00:00:15.330> from<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> mini<00:00:15.780> turbo<00:00:16.109> zipper<00:00:16.590> or

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
boosting from a mini turbo zipper or

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.710 
boosting from a mini turbo zipper or
mushroom<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.369> help<00:00:17.580> keep<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.970> your<00:00:18.270> momentum

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
mushroom to help keep up your momentum

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.000 
mushroom to help keep up your momentum
and<00:00:18.930> move<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.199> faster<00:00:19.800> than<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and move a little faster than you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
and move a little faster than you
normally<00:00:20.160> would<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.270> technique<00:00:21.630> has<00:00:21.779> caused

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
normally would the technique has caused

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779 
normally would the technique has caused
some<00:00:22.170> controversy<00:00:22.410> mainly<00:00:23.189> from<00:00:23.369> casual

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
some controversy mainly from casual

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
some controversy mainly from casual
players<00:00:24.090> who<00:00:24.269> think<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.539> unfair<00:00:24.960> while<00:00:25.619> most

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
players who think it's unfair while most

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
players who think it's unfair while most
players<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> Mario<00:00:27.000> Kart<00:00:27.060> community<00:00:27.630> seem

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
players in the Mario Kart community seem

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
players in the Mario Kart community seem
to<00:00:27.990> embrace<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.500> including<00:00:28.890> myself<00:00:29.210> now<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to embrace it including myself now I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.179 
to embrace it including myself now I
personally<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> technique<00:00:31.679> adds<00:00:31.920> an

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
personally think this technique adds an

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
personally think this technique adds an
extra<00:00:32.340> layer<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> depth<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> mechanics

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
extra layer of depth to the mechanics

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
extra layer of depth to the mechanics
and<00:00:34.530> makes<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.100> fuel<00:00:35.489> faster<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and makes the game fuel faster and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
and makes the game fuel faster and
overall<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.870> enjoyable<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:38.129> top<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.520> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
overall more enjoyable on top of that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
overall more enjoyable on top of that
it's<00:00:38.969> fairly<00:00:39.239> easy<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.690> pull<00:00:39.840> off<00:00:39.870> once<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's fairly easy to pull off once you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.450 
it's fairly easy to pull off once you
get<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> hang<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> doesn't<00:00:41.219> really

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
get the hang of it and doesn't really

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
get the hang of it and doesn't really
hurt<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.790> hands<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.899> Mario<00:00:43.320> Kart

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
hurt your hands at all like Mario Kart

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.799 
hurt your hands at all like Mario Kart
DSS<00:00:44.010> snaking<00:00:44.340> might've<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.910> remember<00:00:45.629> watching

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
DSS snaking might've I remember watching

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
DSS snaking might've I remember watching
the<00:00:46.020> world<00:00:46.230> records<00:00:46.530> before<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> technique

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the world records before the technique

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
the world records before the technique
got<00:00:47.430> found<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.329> thinking<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> game

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
got found and was thinking how the game

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.619 
got found and was thinking how the game
looked<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.590> slow<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.850> thanks<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
looked pretty slow but thanks to this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.479 
looked pretty slow but thanks to this
new<00:00:51.690> technique<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> new<00:00:52.739> world<00:00:52.949> records<00:00:53.309> like

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
new technique the new world records like

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
new technique the new world records like

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bony slash fire hopping works uh this is

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.570 
bony slash fire hopping works uh this is
that's<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> video<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.369> gonna

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that's what this video is for I'm gonna

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's what this video is for I'm gonna
do<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.850> best<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.360> explain<00:01:09.799> my<00:01:10.799> understanding

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
do my best to explain my understanding

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
do my best to explain my understanding
of<00:01:11.549> how<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.790> works

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of how it works

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.679 
of how it works
first<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:14.310> situational<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.390> don't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
first off it's situational you don't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.870 
first off it's situational you don't
always<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.799> hopping<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> madman

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
always want to be hopping like a madman

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
always want to be hopping like a madman
after<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.570> turbo<00:01:18.930> mushroom<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.500> boost<00:01:19.650> pad<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
after me turbo mushroom or boost pad in

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
after me turbo mushroom or boost pad in
most<00:01:20.850> downhill<00:01:21.240> sections<00:01:21.689> especially<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
most downhill sections especially the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
most downhill sections especially the
ones<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.890> almost<00:01:23.100> 90<00:01:23.640> degrees<00:01:23.970> downward

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
ones that go almost 90 degrees downward

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140 
ones that go almost 90 degrees downward
it's<00:01:24.600> definitely<00:01:25.470> slower<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.939> those

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's definitely slower on up those

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
it's definitely slower on up those
sections<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.750> almost<00:01:27.960> always<00:01:28.200> faster<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.950> do

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
sections it's almost always faster to do

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800 
sections it's almost always faster to do
this<00:01:29.220> technique<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> know

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
this technique if you want to know

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
this technique if you want to know
exactly<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.680> faster<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.189> watching

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
exactly when it's faster or not watching

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.399 
exactly when it's faster or not watching
the<00:01:32.909> world<00:01:33.119> record<00:01:33.420> ghosts<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.900> probably<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the world record ghosts is probably the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.249 
the world record ghosts is probably the
most<00:01:34.530> reliable<00:01:34.770> source<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
most reliable source so now for this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.330 
most reliable source so now for this
technique<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.220> many

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
straightaways as you can while you're

mushrooms<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> boost<00:01:46.439> panels<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
mushrooms and boost panels you want to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880 
mushrooms and boost panels you want to
get<00:01:47.280> four<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.549> five<00:01:47.640> hops<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.290> when<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
get four or five hops in when you can so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
get four or five hops in when you can so
for<00:01:50.159> example<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.840> five

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
for example right here I get like five

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
for example right here I get like five
hops<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.369> definitely<00:01:53.729> speeds<00:01:53.970> me<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
hops in and it definitely speeds me up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.950 
hops in and it definitely speeds me up
and<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.969> top<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.420> there<00:01:56.750> are<00:01:56.780> some

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
and on top of that there are some

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.569 
and on top of that there are some
sections<00:01:57.439> though<00:01:57.710> like<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.159> said<00:01:58.369> where<00:01:58.549> you

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
sections though like I said where you

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.190 
sections though like I said where you
don't<00:01:58.850> want<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.270> coming<00:01:59.899> up<00:01:59.960> right<00:02:00.170> here

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
don't want to do it coming up right here

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.649 
don't want to do it coming up right here
is<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.590> perfect<00:02:00.920> example<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.729> somewhere<00:02:02.090> where

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
is a perfect example of somewhere where

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.450 
is a perfect example of somewhere where
you<00:02:02.750> do<00:02:02.899> not<00:02:03.049> want<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.350> fire<00:02:03.470> hop<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.070> 90

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
you do not want to fire hop it's like 90

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.580 
you do not want to fire hop it's like 90
degrees<00:02:04.490> downward<00:02:05.030> you'll<00:02:06.020> lose<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.259> lot<00:02:06.380> of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
degrees downward you'll lose a lot of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.199 
degrees downward you'll lose a lot of
time<00:02:06.710> if<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:06.920> do<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.070> there<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.729> physics<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
time if you do it there the physics in

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.820 
time if you do it there the physics in
this<00:02:08.330> game<00:02:08.509> are<00:02:08.539> really<00:02:08.660> weird<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:09.649> just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
this game are really weird I'm just

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.190 
this game are really weird I'm just
gonna<00:02:09.979> say<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.000> leave<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.569> at<00:02:11.780> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
gonna say that and leave it at that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.290 
gonna say that and leave it at that
but<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:13.099> technique<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.580> easiest<00:02:14.030> when<00:02:14.209> you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
but this technique is easiest when you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.460 
but this technique is easiest when you
don't<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.720> collect<00:02:14.989> things<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.410> you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
don't have to collect things and you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.960 
don't have to collect things and you
don't<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.739> to<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.010> too<00:02:16.040> much<00:02:16.310> alignment<00:02:16.790> like

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
don't have to do too much alignment like

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.460 
don't have to do too much alignment like
right<00:02:17.180> there<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.510> toad<00:02:17.720> Harbor<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.200> really

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
right there on toad Harbor it's really

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.259 
right there on toad Harbor it's really
easy<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.980> lot<00:02:19.099> of<00:02:19.220> room<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.610> do<00:02:19.880> left-right

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
easy of a lot of room to do left-right

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:20.710 
easy of a lot of room to do left-right
left-right

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
left-right

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600 
left-right
same<00:02:21.560> goes<00:02:21.769> for<00:02:21.800> right<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.370> have

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
same goes for right here you just have

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.130 
same goes for right here you just have
to<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.849> off<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.209> left<00:02:23.390> after<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.810> finish

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
to get off to the left after you finish

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
to get off to the left after you finish
your<00:02:24.319> directional<00:02:24.709> hopping<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:26.450> here

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
your directional hopping and right here

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
your directional hopping and right here
I<00:02:26.720> show<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.110> don't<00:02:27.349> have<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.769> do<00:02:27.890> left-right

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
I show you don't have to do left-right

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.110 
I show you don't have to do left-right
left-right

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
left-right

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.479 
left-right
I<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.569> left<00:02:30.019> left<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.410> right<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.190> align

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
I do left left right right then I align

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.190 
I do left left right right then I align
back<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.940> straight<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.989> worked

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
back to straight and that worked

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.770 
back to straight and that worked
completely<00:02:33.530> fine<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:35.239> could<00:02:35.330> also<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:35.690> on

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
completely fine you could also do on

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.539 
completely fine you could also do on
anti-gravity<00:02:36.110> sections<00:02:36.769> not<00:02:37.099> all<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.430> them

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
anti-gravity sections not all of them

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.910 
anti-gravity sections not all of them
work<00:02:37.700> though<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:39.019> works<00:02:39.200> fine<00:02:39.470> an<00:02:39.590> electro

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
work though it works fine an electro

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320 
work though it works fine an electro
dome<00:02:40.099> right<00:02:40.280> there<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:40.849> feels<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.269> little

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
dome right there it just feels a little

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.330 
dome right there it just feels a little
bit<00:02:41.480> awkward<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.110> right<00:02:42.650> here<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.040> example

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
bit awkward and right here is an example

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.050 
bit awkward and right here is an example
of<00:02:43.700> only<00:02:44.239> doing<00:02:44.360> two<00:02:44.840> hops<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:46.060> orange

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
of only doing two hops on a orange

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.819 
of only doing two hops on a orange
winter<00:02:47.390> boat<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.019> do<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.230> single<00:02:48.530> hop

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
winter boat and then I do a single hop

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.800 
winter boat and then I do a single hop
and<00:02:49.069> then<00:02:49.250> adrift<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.000> blue<00:02:50.239> miniature<00:02:50.630> boat

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and then adrift on a blue miniature boat

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.470 
and then adrift on a blue miniature boat
and<00:02:51.019> like<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.380> said<00:02:51.440> before<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.519> bloomin<00:02:53.150> turbo

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
and like I said before the bloomin turbo

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.360 
and like I said before the bloomin turbo
single<00:02:53.810> hops<00:02:54.019> are<00:02:54.319> really<00:02:54.709> helpful<00:02:54.950> but

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
single hops are really helpful but

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.039 
single hops are really helpful but
definitely<00:02:55.849> very<00:02:55.880> situational<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.780> only<00:02:56.870> do

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
definitely very situational you only do

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.440 
definitely very situational you only do
any<00:02:57.230> other<00:02:57.380> drift<00:02:57.650> coming<00:02:57.950> up<00:02:58.269> sections<00:02:59.269> like

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
any other drift coming up sections like

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.150 
any other drift coming up sections like
these<00:02:59.690> on<00:02:59.900> fall<00:03:00.109> prunes<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.620> have<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.859> do<00:03:00.980> all

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
these on fall prunes you have to do all

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.500 
these on fall prunes you have to do all
of<00:03:01.190> your<00:03:01.370> hopping<00:03:01.819> and<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.329> to

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
of your hopping and then you have to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.449 
of your hopping and then you have to
align<00:03:02.750> somewhere<00:03:03.260> those<00:03:03.920> are<00:03:04.100> especially

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
align somewhere those are especially

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.360 
align somewhere those are especially
difficult<00:03:04.880> because<00:03:05.680> it's<00:03:06.680> hard<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.040> get

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
difficult because it's hard to get

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.830 
difficult because it's hard to get
alignment<00:03:07.730> right<00:03:08.030> after<00:03:08.359> you<00:03:08.450> do<00:03:08.569> all<00:03:08.600> this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
alignment right after you do all this

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.599 
alignment right after you do all this
hopping<00:03:09.260> laptop<00:03:09.890> cruise<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.489> the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
hopping laptop cruise this is the

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.770 
hopping laptop cruise this is the
section<00:03:10.819> where<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.239> actually<00:03:11.600> really

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
section where it's actually really

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.160 
section where it's actually really
difficult

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
difficult

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.920 
difficult
to<00:03:13.709> get<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:13.980> hops<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.660> get

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
to get in hops and then you have to get

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.690 
to get in hops and then you have to get
to<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> boost<00:03:16.380> panel<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.459> five

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
to a boost panel and I do that like five

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.000 
to a boost panel and I do that like five
times<00:03:17.940> I'm<00:03:18.239> not<00:03:18.300> super<00:03:18.780> good<00:03:18.900> at<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.140> one

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
times I'm not super good at that one

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.050 
times I'm not super good at that one
that's<00:03:20.370> definitely<00:03:20.580> one<00:03:20.849> of<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> most

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
that's definitely one of the most

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360 
that's definitely one of the most
advanced<00:03:21.450> parts<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.200> game<00:03:22.650> let<00:03:22.920> us<00:03:23.069> simple

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
advanced parts in the game let us simple

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.640 
advanced parts in the game let us simple
ones<00:03:23.520> like<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.880> on<00:03:24.150> toad<00:03:24.420> harbor<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
ones like this on toad harbor are the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.839 
ones like this on toad harbor are the
ones<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.980> practice<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.489> at<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.730> beginning

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
ones to practice on at the beginning

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.479 
ones to practice on at the beginning
just<00:03:27.440> remember<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.560> synchronize<00:03:28.950> your<00:03:29.190> jumps

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
just remember to synchronize your jumps

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.979 
just remember to synchronize your jumps
with<00:03:29.640> left<00:03:29.910> right<00:03:30.150> left<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.810> then

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
with left right left right and then

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.020 
with left right left right and then
align<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.950> wherever<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.430> need<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.610> go

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
align to get to wherever you need to go

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.330 
align to get to wherever you need to go
so<00:03:33.750> yeah<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.380> technique<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.920> lot<00:03:35.069> of<00:03:35.160> fun

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
so yeah this technique is a lot of fun

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.490 
so yeah this technique is a lot of fun
once<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> hang<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.810> keep

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
once you get the hang of it so keep

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.290 
once you get the hang of it so keep
practicing<00:03:37.709> if<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> don't<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.819> down<00:03:39.000> and

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
practicing if you don't have it down and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.720 
practicing if you don't have it down and
I<00:03:40.200> hope<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.590> video<00:03:40.769> helped<00:03:41.250> thanks<00:03:41.610> for

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
I hope this video helped thanks for

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.090 
I hope this video helped thanks for
