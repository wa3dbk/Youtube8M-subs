00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello out here and thank you very much 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.650
 turn on today there is another 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 delicious pasta dish and do that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 would be with a nice bunch of parsley 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.830
 what we now cut first small 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 and of course we need one more 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.109
 until two onions just small 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.789
 cut and dice and a bit 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.470
 bacon is not missing 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.390
 I put that into beautiful little ones too 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.859
 Some dice are needed already 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.109
 sharp knife and a bit of power 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 because sometimes it is already relatively difficult 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.460
 to cut through is then some rapeseed oil 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 in a pan give alternative 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.629
 olive oil and then first for two to 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.899
 three minutes the civil ones stew and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.860
 then to give the hot peppers 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 and just now I nor the two 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 add garlic cloves and about one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.989
 third of our parsley the rest 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 you need much later and that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.309
 leave completely for another two to three 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.840
 minutes in the pan and in the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.070
 next step we go ours already 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.570
 Of course you can also add bacon 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 we send for alternative use 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 with this bacon I leave the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.619
 Sear a little longer so that 's nice 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 crispy and where they go after everything 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.939
 a few minutes and the whole will 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 Now with tomatenmark a bit 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.600
 created and after a few minutes in the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 pan the whole thing with ours 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.780
 Passed tomatoes or tomato pieces 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.970
 and a little bit of white wine and that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.829
 We then told everyone again and again 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 a bit of cooking water from noodle 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.850
 then it gets pretty creamy and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.909
 At the end we make the flame 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.210
 go out the parsley one more 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.530
 good special oil stir all over and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.180
 we can already do that with the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 freshly cooked pasta of your choice 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.240
 serve 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.829
 I wish you much fun 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.659
 cooking and, above all, good appetite 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.310
 and if you want to be sharp 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.520
 tried a city ​​council should just 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.259
 times a lot of oil if you want to have it too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.390
 sweetened just try it 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.820
 French toast tastes great with cinnamon 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.710
 or alternatively, I recommend you the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.630
 sweet pears with red wine tastes great 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.399
 with from the 1 and I'm happy about 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.899
 a comment or salt and of course 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.500
 a subscription and I'll ask you up 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.500
 next time
