00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.119 

it's<00:01:00.249> basically<00:01:00.519> a<00:01:00.699> Ford<00:01:01.539> f-550<00:01:02.019> chassis<00:01:02.260> is

what<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.489> is

what it is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.139 
what it is
sedan<00:01:04.360> 550<00:01:04.869> but<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.110> weighs<00:01:05.649> twice<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:05.920> much

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
sedan 550 but it weighs twice as much

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.730 
sedan 550 but it weighs twice as much
and<00:01:07.149> then<00:01:07.450> they<00:01:07.600> fabricate<00:01:08.200> their<00:01:08.350> own<00:01:08.500> or

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
and then they fabricate their own or

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.469

related<00:01:09.159> body<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.520> top<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
related body on top of it so the

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.749 
related body on top of it so the
performance<00:01:10.960> would<00:01:11.080> be<00:01:11.320> equivalent<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:11.950> an<00:01:12.430> m5

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
performance would be equivalent to an m5

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.880 
performance would be equivalent to an m5

260 m you know 3.2 seconds in it but

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.010 
260 m you know 3.2 seconds in it but
once<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.549> gets<00:01:18.880> going<00:01:19.060> if<00:01:19.570> it's<00:01:19.750> pretty
