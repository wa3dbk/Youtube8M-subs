00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
short i think they could have made it a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
short i think they could have made it a
bit<00:00:43.320> longer<00:00:43.559> than<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> would<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.160> liked<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.670> so

bit longer than I would have liked it so

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450

like the perks and putting on hardline

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.510 
like the perks and putting on hardline
so<00:06:44.580> like<00:06:44.880> domination<00:06:45.480> you'll<00:06:45.630> kill<00:06:45.870> someone

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
you'll get 50 instead of getting the

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.440 
you'll get 50 instead of getting the
perks<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.950> purkett<00:06:50.430> it<00:06:50.760> was<00:06:50.910> yo<00:06:51.030> get<00:06:51.210> it<00:06:51.240> at

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
perks the purkett it was yo get it at

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.210 
perks the purkett it was yo get it at
first<00:06:51.780> you'll<00:06:51.990> still<00:06:52.230> get<00:06:52.350> it<00:06:52.470> at<00:06:52.590> first<00:06:52.920> kill
