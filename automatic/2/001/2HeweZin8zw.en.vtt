00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.100
 Hey! I welcome you very warmly. 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100
 What connects chicken and a bottle of beer? 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.000
 Today I will show you in this recipe for chicken on a bottle of beer. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 I invite you! 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.350
 Our marinade goes for the chicken. We have to rub our meat thoroughly. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Here you have to have some fun. You have to get dirty. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 Of course, pour a little marinade inside. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 That our meat will pass the flavors. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 And of course the other side. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The chicken should marinate best all night in the fridge. 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 But also two hours will be enough. This is a fairly intense marinade, 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 so it should not be a problem for the meat to pass these flavors. 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.300
 Therefore, we proceed to the main activity. Is our hero, or beer. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 It's important to clean our bottle of beer from all our papers. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.800
 Room temperature. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 We take our chicken and stuff it. There is no great philosophy here. 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 He should stand at attention. Here the head sticks out. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Beer under the influence of temperature will boil and pour our beautiful meat. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 If the beers would run out to make it fade, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 just add a little salt and it will continue to foam. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 We put it in the oven! 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Let's look at the chicken. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 To get a little beer out of it just pour in salt. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And wait a second. And here comes the foam. Bake for 10 minutes. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 This is how our chicken presents proudly on a bottle of beer. Enjoy your meal!
