00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
 on YouTube in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.900
 to teach how to fix a microphone 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.900
 for the counter strike 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.190
 and well, more nothing, let's start 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.000
 sure you have bought a 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.860
 mic and they went to try it and they go 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.350
 by a server they ask if he leaves 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.740
 well or they did not tell you that it was cut 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.820
 that the voice is not well appreciated but then 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.169
 I showed him a solution 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.169
 let's copy 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.969
 these codes that go to the description 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.030
 expenses 3 the bag lot pack to hear 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.030
 As you listen, I can tell you 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.180
 server I will not put it because yes no 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.190
 you will not go to another so nothing else 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.260
 to see how I am the microphone with the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.019
 bots 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 and the others, we paste it in console 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.720
 how to do to copy the two 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.010
 copy 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.010
 let's go to the counter 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.539
 well then we go here says 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.780
 that is before entering the Serbian we are going to 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.470
 put the codes on the console the key 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.230
 which is below the exhaust 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.330
 and we are going to paste the two and here we are going to 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.410
 delete the second let's leave 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:48.140
 only the cl with low m is treated me 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.250
 60 saw himself do the first the second and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.590
 this one we're going to erase him 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.880
 first but I can be like 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.380
 want to talk to so it's more 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 fast does not have to be minimizing the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 control and the other is the underscore 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.130
 Patera Te 60 we hit and when 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.610
 let's enter a server what you have to 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.180
 ask how you hear and then they'll 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.129
 they will say 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.849
 it also happened when I bought it the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:20.209
 microphone and I was asking him and if that 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.900
 I was still cut and they gave me these codes 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.370
 and can fix it because I hope that they 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.370
 it worked ciao
