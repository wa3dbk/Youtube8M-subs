00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.260
 also this 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.070
 in a world that she will be destroying today 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.409
 I come to propose 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.639
 through this small and insignificant group 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.019
 build 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.679
 an architecture 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.009
 of wellness 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.009
 from there every one of us 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.789
 without being heroes 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.060
 without being leaders 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.330
 without great ideas 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.240
 I am a man who walked 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.200
 with the foots 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
 they are signed to the earth 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.830
 so 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.830
 I think yes each one of us 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.160
 plant your own seed 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 of serenity of peace 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 and protect your own plant 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.530
 and let it grow 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.720
 over time there will be 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.230
 many 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.140
 peace plants 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.850
 because wars 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.730
 and the destructions 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 are produced by humans 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.510
 who take care of their own plants 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.740
 and who takes care of his own 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.740
 It does not matter what you do 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.600
 I come 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.120
 to try that 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.740
 let's think 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 that who does not think like us is not an enemy 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 it can be an adversary 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.010
 that everyone has the right 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.660
 to express yourself 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.660
 even if we do not agree 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.520
 that aggression 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 It is not the way 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.780
 we have a group 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 beautiful in this moment of great participation 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 and I think we have to go one step further 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.299
 and that step 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.639
 is personal 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.239
 A commitment 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.799
 summon peace 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.109
 for worrying us 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.439
 poor is a word that I detect 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.199
 yes no for the raise 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 they are forgotten 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.619
 why nobody cares 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.619
 so they are suffering 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.679
 and plant 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.719
 seeds of peace 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.719
 with the people around us 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.709
 as as 'lock-out' happens on facebook or 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.959
 one starts with three friends and was soon after are thousands 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.939
 so we will be 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.559
 sowers 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.139
 of serenity and inner peace 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.029
 and when there is inner peace 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.499
 soon it is projected 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.799
 to peace in the world 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.989
 I just want to say hello 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.679
 I want to thank you 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.679
 the participation they have in this group 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.619
 to all 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.099
 and one and every one of you finishes 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.759
 I want you to know 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.079
 That for me 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.169

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.169
