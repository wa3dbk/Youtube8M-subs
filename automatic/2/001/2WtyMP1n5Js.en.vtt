get yourself some colored sticks like

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.900 
get yourself some colored sticks like
these<00:00:05.460> ones

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.610 

you'll<00:00:08.910> need<00:00:09.059> some<00:00:09.300> elastics<00:00:09.870> like<00:00:10.380> these

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
you'll need some elastics like these

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.520 
you'll need some elastics like these
ones<00:00:11.599> you'll<00:00:12.599> probably<00:00:12.780> need<00:00:13.110> some<00:00:13.320> bigger

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
ones you'll probably need some bigger

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.929 
elastics like these ones now we're going
to<00:00:18.390> start<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.840> seven<00:00:19.410> sticks<00:00:19.820> we're<00:00:20.820> going

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
to start with seven sticks we're going

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
to start with seven sticks we're going
to<00:00:21.000> put<00:00:21.210> six<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.660> them<00:00:21.840> around<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.890> we're

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
to put six of them around one and we're

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.070 
to put six of them around one and we're
going<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> put<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:23.880> elastic<00:00:24.119> around<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.869> end

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
going to put an elastic around one end

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.650 
going to put an elastic around one end
of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.380> end<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.390> okay<00:00:27.390> not

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
of the end of them like this okay not

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
of the end of them like this okay not
too<00:00:27.840> tight<00:00:30.349> now<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> take<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
too tight now we're going to take two of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.330 
too tight now we're going to take two of
these<00:00:32.340> green<00:00:32.730> guys<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.980> split<00:00:34.980> those<00:00:35.130> off<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
these green guys and split those off so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
these green guys and split those off so
that<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.149> see<00:00:36.300> two<00:00:36.570> three<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.380> two

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that you can see two three and then two

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.970 
that you can see two three and then two
of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.520> original<00:00:38.610> sticks<00:00:39.739> then<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:40.860> going

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of the original sticks then we're going

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.810 
of the original sticks then we're going
to<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.430> couple<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> blue<00:00:42.000> guys<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
to put a couple of blue guys in in

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.069 
to put a couple of blue guys in in
crossways<00:00:44.820> -<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> green<00:00:45.539> guides<00:00:45.750> also

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
crossways - the green guides also

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.290 
crossways - the green guides also
splitting<00:00:46.590> off<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> blue<00:00:47.039> ones<00:00:47.250> -<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
splitting off the blue ones - three and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.560 
splitting off the blue ones - three and
two<00:00:48.980> these<00:00:49.980> green<00:00:50.280> ones<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.730> parallel<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
two these green ones go parallel to the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.729 
two these green ones go parallel to the
original<00:00:51.660> green<00:00:52.289> ones<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:57.230> now<00:00:58.230> again<00:00:58.379> we're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
original green ones and now again we're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
original green ones and now again we're
going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.430> more<00:00:59.460> of<00:01:00.090> these<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.960> these

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
going to put two more of these of these

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.290 
going to put two more of these of these
black<00:01:01.500> ones

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.130

so<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.290> way<00:01:07.410> the<00:01:07.530> green<00:01:07.740> ones<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.070> black

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so this way the green ones and black

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
so this way the green ones and black
ones<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.670> interleaved<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.570> they're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
ones are interleaved and they're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.060 
ones are interleaved and they're
crossways<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.220> each<00:01:11.340> other<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> we'll<00:01:13.860> put

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
crossways to each other so we'll put

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.790 
crossways to each other so we'll put
elastics<00:01:14.820> around<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> ends<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.620> these

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
elastics around the ends of all of these

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.460 
elastics around the ends of all of these
different<00:01:17.340> colors<00:01:18.120> of<00:01:18.150> sticks<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.260> hold

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
different colors of sticks just to hold

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.800 
different colors of sticks just to hold
it<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.710> together

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it all together

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
it all together
so<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:22.020> elastics<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.890> black<00:01:23.160> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so there's elastics around the black and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.050 
so there's elastics around the black and
the<00:01:23.640> green<00:01:23.910> on<00:01:24.300> one<00:01:24.840> end<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.110> each<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> around

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the green on one end of each and around

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.780 
the green on one end of each and around
the<00:01:27.180> other<00:01:27.360> ends

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:44.140 

[Music]

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.450 

and<00:01:45.290> we'll<00:01:46.290> put<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.590> elastic<00:01:46.830> around<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and we'll put an elastic around the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.990 
and we'll put an elastic around the
original<00:01:47.970> color<00:01:48.240> too<00:01:52.340> okay<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.760> green

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
original color too okay so the green

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.680 
original color too okay so the green
ones<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.450> crossways<00:01:54.960> -<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> black<00:01:55.440> ones<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
ones are crossways - the black ones and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.540 
ones are crossways - the black ones and
they're<00:01:57.690> interleaved<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.350> each<00:01:58.530> other<00:01:58.770> now

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
they're interleaved with each other now

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.100 
they're interleaved with each other now
watch<00:01:59.729> carefully<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.660> step<00:02:00.900> that's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
watch carefully because the step that's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.260 
watch carefully because the step that's
coming<00:02:01.440> up<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.130> crucial<00:02:02.369> step<00:02:02.550> we<00:02:03.000> need<00:02:03.150> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
coming up is the crucial step we need to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.749 
coming up is the crucial step we need to
put<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> fourth<00:02:03.780> color<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:05.160> put<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.610> on

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
put a fourth color in you put it down on

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.109 
put a fourth color in you put it down on
the<00:02:05.790> table<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.740> squish<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> if

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the table like this and you squish it if

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
the table like this and you squish it if
you<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> right<00:02:09.899> way<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.709> two

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you do it the right way there are two

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.860 
you do it the right way there are two
ways<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.790> down<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.970> fit<00:02:12.209> if<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.630> do<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
ways to put it down a fit if you do it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.570 
ways to put it down a fit if you do it
the<00:02:12.959> right<00:02:13.080> way<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.530> squish<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.310> you'll

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
the right way you squish it you'll

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.220 
the right way you squish it you'll
reveal<00:02:14.910> some<00:02:15.150> holes<00:02:15.450> where<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:15.989> stick

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
reveal some holes where you can stick

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.800 
reveal some holes where you can stick
these<00:02:16.380> red<00:02:16.620> sticks<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:20.180> stick<00:02:21.180> those<00:02:21.390> red

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
these red sticks in stick those red

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.560 
these red sticks in stick those red
sticks<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> holes<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:23.720> there's<00:02:24.720> one

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
sticks in the holes now there's one

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.090 
sticks in the holes now there's one
you'll<00:02:27.570> see<00:02:27.780> four<00:02:28.230> holes<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.920> are

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
you'll see four holes that are

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.580 
you'll see four holes that are
completely<00:02:29.550> closed<00:02:29.910> off<00:02:30.320> but<00:02:31.320> there<00:02:31.470> are

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
completely closed off but there are

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.750 
completely closed off but there are
holes<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.160> kind<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.580> around<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:35.580> are

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
holes that are kind of around that are

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.340 
holes that are kind of around that are
that<00:02:36.120> are<00:02:36.180> open<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:36.959> end

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
that are open on one end

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
that are open on one end
I<00:02:37.440> guess<00:02:37.590> they<00:02:37.709> look<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.220> slots<00:02:38.670> but

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
I guess they look more like slots but

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.479 
I guess they look more like slots but
that's<00:02:39.330> okay<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:40.560> once<00:02:40.709> you've<00:02:40.860> got<00:02:41.040> some<00:02:41.310> red

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
that's okay so once you've got some red

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.920 
that's okay so once you've got some red
sticks<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.420> push<00:02:42.660> them<00:02:42.870> through

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
sticks in you can just push them through

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
sticks in you can just push them through
with<00:02:43.320> your<00:02:43.440> palm<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.120> keep

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
with your palm and then you can keep

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.520 
with your palm and then you can keep
sticking<00:02:45.840> more<00:02:46.739> red<00:02:46.980> sticks<00:02:48.200> now<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.260> doesn't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
sticking more red sticks now it doesn't

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.460 
sticking more red sticks now it doesn't
matter<00:02:49.739> too<00:02:50.100> much<00:02:50.130> what<00:02:50.610> shape<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.290> make

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
matter too much what shape you you make

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.620 
matter too much what shape you you make
with<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.829> sticks<00:02:53.100> as<00:02:53.459> long<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:53.880> all<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
with the sticks as long as all the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.670 
with the sticks as long as all the
sticks<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.049> one<00:02:55.200> color<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.769> parallel<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:57.680> I'm

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
sticks of one color are parallel so I'm

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.930 
sticks of one color are parallel so I'm
just<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.010> keep<00:02:59.190> putting<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.549> more<00:02:59.730> red

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
just going to keep putting in more red

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.380 
just going to keep putting in more red
sticks<00:03:00.320> I've<00:03:01.320> chosen<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:02.100> use<00:03:02.430> hexagonal

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
sticks I've chosen to use hexagonal

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.880 
sticks I've chosen to use hexagonal
shapes<00:03:05.600> okay<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.660> an<00:03:07.049> elastic<00:03:07.500> goes<00:03:07.650> around

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
shapes okay so an elastic goes around

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.819 
shapes okay so an elastic goes around
the<00:03:08.040> red<00:03:08.220> sticks<00:03:10.250> each<00:03:11.250> end<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.500> we<00:03:13.620> are

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
the red sticks each end and there we are

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:21.190 
the red sticks each end and there we are
that<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.750> hexa<00:03:15.750> sticks<00:03:16.070> level<00:03:17.070> one

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.410 

basically<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.440> expand<00:03:22.950> each<00:03:23.280> color<00:03:23.610> one<00:03:24.209> at<00:03:24.330> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
basically we expand each color one at a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.920 
basically we expand each color one at a
time

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
time

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.259

so<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.709> I've<00:03:25.890> stuck<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> green<00:03:26.580> new<00:03:27.000> green

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
so here I've stuck a green new green

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.420 
so here I've stuck a green new green
stick<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.660> parallel<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.230> other<00:03:28.410> ones<00:03:28.650> I'm<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
stick in parallel to other ones I'm just

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.470 
stick in parallel to other ones I'm just
using<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.790> other<00:03:30.030> one<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.300> lift<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.660> elastic

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
using that other one to lift the elastic

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.839 
using that other one to lift the elastic

there's a lot of repetition here so

okay<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:02.760> here<00:04:03.239> I'm<00:04:03.330> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.569> show<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.810> a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
okay so here I'm going to show you a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.319 
okay so here I'm going to show you a
little<00:04:04.110> trick<00:04:04.349> now<00:04:05.189> you<00:04:05.819> notice<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.120> my

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
little trick now you notice that my

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.119 
little trick now you notice that my
green<00:04:06.510> sticks<00:04:06.840> were<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.230> hexagonal<00:04:07.920> shape

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
green sticks were in a hexagonal shape

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.429 
green sticks were in a hexagonal shape
and<00:04:08.700> I've<00:04:09.060> taken<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.360> elastics<00:04:09.930> off<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.349> I'm

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
and I've taken the elastics off and I'm

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.979 
and I've taken the elastics off and I'm
putting<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:11.040> stick<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.939> at<00:04:12.090> each<00:04:12.299> corner<00:04:12.780> of

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
putting a stick in at each corner of

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.969 
putting a stick in at each corner of
them<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:14.599> now<00:04:15.599> I'm<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.650> put<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
them and now I'm going to put the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.430 
them and now I'm going to put the
elastic<00:04:17.400> back<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.419> I've<00:04:18.690> only<00:04:18.870> expanded

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
elastic back on and I've only expanded

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.210 
elastic back on and I've only expanded
this<00:04:19.530> by<00:04:19.739> six<00:04:20.400> sticks<00:04:20.699> one<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.299> each<00:04:21.510> corner

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
this by six sticks one on each corner

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.320 
this by six sticks one on each corner
and<00:04:24.710> by<00:04:25.710> putting<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.400> expansion<00:04:27.060> on<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and by putting the expansion on the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.260 
and by putting the expansion on the
corner<00:04:27.740> it's<00:04:28.740> easier<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.460> me<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.669> put<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
corner it's easier for me to put the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.600 
corner it's easier for me to put the
rest<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.780> sticks<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.710> expansion<00:04:32.340> of

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
rest of the sticks in the expansion of

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.830 
rest of the sticks in the expansion of
green<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:34.800> put<00:04:34.979> them<00:04:35.130> in<00:04:35.250> without<00:04:35.880> having<00:04:36.720> to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
green to put them in without having to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.830 
green to put them in without having to
move<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.320> elastic<00:04:37.830> later<00:04:38.300> see<00:04:39.300> how<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.600> just

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
move the elastic later see how that just

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
move the elastic later see how that just
slips<00:04:40.229> right<00:04:40.320> in<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> elastic<00:04:41.820> does<00:04:41.970> not

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
slips right in and the elastic does not

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.250 
slips right in and the elastic does not
get<00:04:42.449> in<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.600> way<00:04:44.449> this<00:04:45.449> helps<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.780> lot<00:04:45.960> when

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
get in the way this helps a lot when

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.550 
get in the way this helps a lot when
you're<00:04:46.470> doing<00:04:46.850> bigger<00:04:48.169> hexa<00:04:49.169> sticks<00:04:49.410> like

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
you're doing bigger hexa sticks like

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.340 
you're doing bigger hexa sticks like
this<00:04:49.830> where<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.430> need<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.789> expand<00:04:51.350> each

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
this where you need to expand each

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.590 
this where you need to expand each
expansion<00:04:52.800> is<00:04:53.130> like<00:04:53.520> there's<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.240> lot<00:04:54.449> of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
expansion is like there's a lot of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.230 
expansion is like there's a lot of
sticks<00:04:55.229> nickel

larger<00:05:35.470> elastics<00:05:36.070> just<00:05:36.400> because<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.850> smaller

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
larger elastics just because the smaller

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.200 
larger elastics just because the smaller
ones<00:05:37.450> were<00:05:38.130> getting<00:05:39.130> too<00:05:39.370> small<00:05:39.640> now<00:05:39.970> here<00:05:40.150> I'm

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
ones were getting too small now here I'm

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.790 
ones were getting too small now here I'm
going<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.360> do<00:05:40.480> another<00:05:40.690> trick<00:05:40.990> I'm<00:05:41.620> going<00:05:41.740> to

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
going to do another trick I'm going to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.650 
going to do another trick I'm going to
take<00:05:41.920> out<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.190> middle<00:05:42.580> or<00:05:43.030> what<00:05:43.240> I<00:05:43.270> think<00:05:43.540> is

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
take out the middle or what I think is

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.570 
take out the middle or what I think is
the<00:05:43.810> middle<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.800> shape<00:05:45.040> that<00:05:45.190> I'm<00:05:45.310> making

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
the middle of the shape that I'm making

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.280 
the middle of the shape that I'm making
with<00:05:45.700> blue<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.600> I'm<00:05:46.690> just<00:05:46.840> going<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.050> replace

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
with blue and I'm just going to replace

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.720 
with blue and I'm just going to replace
it<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.680> stick<00:05:47.950> of<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.160> different<00:05:48.520> color

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
it with a stick of a different color

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.290 
it with a stick of a different color
that<00:05:49.090> will<00:05:49.540> help<00:05:49.660> me<00:05:49.810> keep<00:05:49.960> track<00:05:50.230> of<00:05:50.380> things

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
that will help me keep track of things

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.070 
that will help me keep track of things
[Music]

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.910 

we're<00:05:56.080> almost<00:05:56.260> done

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
we're almost done

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.070 
we're almost done
adding<00:05:57.370> six<00:05:57.730> but<00:05:58.150> I'm<00:05:58.240> also<00:05:58.420> going<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.840> show

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
adding six but I'm also going to show

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.420 
adding six but I'm also going to show
you<00:05:59.970> how<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.000> finish<00:06:01.690> this<00:06:02.100> instead<00:06:03.100> of<00:06:03.220> just

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
you how I finish this instead of just

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.980 
you how I finish this instead of just
leaving<00:06:03.670> it<00:06:03.820> with<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.210> elastics<00:06:04.750> on

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.080 

so<00:06:10.560> now<00:06:10.889> I'm<00:06:11.009> just<00:06:11.130> going<00:06:11.280> to<00:06:11.340> pour<00:06:11.669> some<00:06:11.940> glue

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
so now I'm just going to pour some glue

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.090 
so now I'm just going to pour some glue
through<00:06:12.419> it<00:06:12.539> and<00:06:12.780> that's<00:06:13.710> going<00:06:13.830> to<00:06:13.889> help<00:06:14.009> keep

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
through it and that's going to help keep

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.980 
through it and that's going to help keep
it<00:06:14.400> together<00:06:14.550> without<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.270> elastics<00:06:15.780> and

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
it together without the elastics and

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.809 
it together without the elastics and
then<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.560> get<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:16.860> glue<00:06:17.069> off<00:06:17.100> I'm<00:06:17.520> just<00:06:17.550> going

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
then to get the glue off I'm just going

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.640 
then to get the glue off I'm just going
to<00:06:17.910> use<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.090> centrifuge<00:06:18.599> that<00:06:19.110> is<00:06:19.259> a<00:06:19.289> human

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
to use a centrifuge that is a human

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.290 
to use a centrifuge that is a human
powered<00:06:20.099> centrifuge<00:06:21.470> there<00:06:22.470> I<00:06:22.500> am<00:06:22.940> there<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:23.970> am

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
powered centrifuge there I am there I am

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.350 
powered centrifuge there I am there I am
being<00:06:24.539> a<00:06:24.599> centrifuge<00:06:25.550> great<00:06:26.550> so<00:06:27.150> when<00:06:27.270> I'm

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
being a centrifuge great so when I'm

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.820 
being a centrifuge great so when I'm
done<00:06:27.509> doing<00:06:27.569> that<00:06:27.870> I've<00:06:28.229> just<00:06:28.440> got<00:06:28.620> to<00:06:28.710> use

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
done doing that I've just got to use

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.950 
done doing that I've just got to use
sandpaper<00:06:29.099> to<00:06:29.490> get<00:06:29.669> some<00:06:29.940> glue<00:06:30.270> marks<00:06:30.569> off<00:06:30.750> of

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
sandpaper to get some glue marks off of

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.170 
sandpaper to get some glue marks off of
it<00:06:31.110> of<00:06:31.860> course<00:06:32.099> I<00:06:32.220> have<00:06:32.340> to<00:06:32.430> let<00:06:32.639> it<00:06:32.759> dry<00:06:32.940> first

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
it of course I have to let it dry first

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.390 
it of course I have to let it dry first
and<00:06:33.509> then<00:06:34.080> if<00:06:34.199> sandpaper<00:06:34.650> isn't<00:06:34.889> enough<00:06:35.069> I<00:06:35.220> can

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
and then if sandpaper isn't enough I can

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.070 
and then if sandpaper isn't enough I can
use<00:06:35.550> a<00:06:35.580> plastic<00:06:36.300> brush<00:06:36.720> on<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.199> dremel<00:06:39.080> after

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
use a plastic brush on a dremel after

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.120 
use a plastic brush on a dremel after
this<00:06:40.229> I'm<00:06:40.380> going<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.560> want<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.800> get<00:06:40.919> rid<00:06:40.979> of

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
this I'm going to want to get rid of

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.310 
this I'm going to want to get rid of
that<00:06:41.250> matte<00:06:41.580> finish<00:06:42.030> by<00:06:42.389> putting<00:06:42.900> an<00:06:43.020> acrylic

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
that matte finish by putting an acrylic

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.350 
that matte finish by putting an acrylic
gloss<00:06:44.130> onto<00:06:44.729> it<00:06:44.880> this<00:06:45.090> is<00:06:45.270> acrylic<00:06:45.539> medium<00:06:46.340> and

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
gloss onto it this is acrylic medium and

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.020 
gloss onto it this is acrylic medium and
when<00:06:48.360> that's<00:06:48.539> dry<00:06:48.750> it's<00:06:49.259> all<00:06:49.440> finished

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:02.170 

you
