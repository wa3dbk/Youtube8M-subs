00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.320
 Hello and welcome to follow 8 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.140
 Background in Germany there is one 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.590
 special palate feasting spies 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:59.230
 Roll roast filled with no end 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:03.640
 because of being really delicious 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.580
 stay then look at me 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.050
 Here we also see everything we do 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:16.760
 for this, ours need to be filled 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.900
 porcini also prepared the smell 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.100
 onions and garlic cut into small pieces 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.330
 some pool because I now cover 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.869
 deleted because I still have them 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:31.250
 Just had pepper and salt 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.130
 to spice up 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.800
 nothing is parsley about 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.200
 from your own garden in the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.220
 I already have the tears cast-iron 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 steamed at or are in the process he 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.100
 tastes the same added that now 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.760
 pull a bit more 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.890
 because you can also equal the places the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.880
 Porcini is going to do 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.050
 that looks pretty good then 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.050
 our mushrooms are added 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.440
 I'm afraid that I'll be back too much 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.010
 well , that meant the whole thing 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.320
 not in the counseling becomes simple 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.620
 no matter and you think with the rest something else 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.660
 another thing that I have for so long now 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.120
 stew 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.490
 It is good salt and pepper are 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.840
 already on it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.840
 the parsley and raise 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.860
 then maybe that would happen if you did 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.000
 would like to do some filling with flour 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.020
 Maybe I'll be the same now 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.060
 do and when do something first 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.060
 on the side 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:04.230
 navis get cold and take care then 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 is around the roast itself spiced the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.440
 whole first with a spice mixture 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.450
 They cast me off and rolled them 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.770
 an exhibition where just here with us 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.770
 ran with was brought 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.410
 inside as well as outside 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.849
 When I look at the weather 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:34.620
 I definitely did too much stuff 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:37.359
 then we come to the 5 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.840
 my god i have never had such a thing 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:46.469
 made as we usually have 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.750
 he has never done that to me 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:53.219
 always wants to do fine things then 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.299
 also mostly or almost always even one 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:00.129
 So with me , at home until now 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.220
 no one complained yet tasted 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.220
 would have 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.290
 suffice 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.940
 when we is to roll up to soon 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.970
 the package is out of the page 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.680
 lace 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.150
 I do not know myself exactly 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.949
 I'll show you in any case but 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:37.090
 Afterwards the result looks at you 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:42.760
 wrapped in my very first self 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:48.660
 advise so the plate hammer no power 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:51.430
 to do that by hand I am satisfied 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.449
 I have always decided that I am always 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.630
 I still closed 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.030
 who else to do that now 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.610
 the potatoes wash coarse salt bed 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.199
 reinsetzen in the pot-free potatoes 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.410
 and fire 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.600
 and then we expect them to be and 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.199
 it looks like it could be inside the pot 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 from the advice of meanwhile wonderful 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.340
 moved in 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.550
 I will now exclude the roast 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.880
 he lies there waiting for one 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.990
 silver packaging and you can 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.990
 fill the coals 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:40.740
 simply with aluminum foil wrapped the 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.740
 is slide-down is open 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:50.370
 I expect it to continue with about 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:53.410
 one and a half hours and a room on 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.830
 Now I will try to unpack them 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.030
 to catch the sauce 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.030
 hey people I have good wrapped 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:14.560
 then we have already history 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:16.910
 briefly said 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.270
 if it really works outside wood 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:23.389
 on and as soon as it is accordingly 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.590
 the violet before I fry again 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:30.340
 go outside for a quick bite on the grill 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:34.669
 with good times left and right 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:36.830
 he was the one who left the lid on what he did 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:41.840
 now get a nice smoke flavor 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:46.220
 because I'm curious you also soya the 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.259
 we can get one more color 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.340
 little 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:54.110
 it is finally done 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:07:00.699
 people i admit i totally fucked 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:07.089
 Miscalculated this time of the time 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:10.089
 but who are wonderful 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.089
 moment 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:17.650
 so you can see wonderful I find 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.460
 gorgeous I go in now and 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.740
 cut 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.610
 and that's the finished result 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.229
 from the roast may have now essential 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.189
 took longer than I thought 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:32.460
 but anyone can misjudge me 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:36.419
 I've never claimed profile anymore 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:39.419
 until the next time the junkie and 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.419
 bye
