been carried through my career but the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.530 
been carried through my career but the
whole<00:02:08.780> idea<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.290> constantly<00:02:09.979> trying<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
whole idea of constantly trying to

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.330 
whole idea of constantly trying to
reinvent<00:02:11.540> yourself<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.440> going<00:02:13.070> through

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
reinvent yourself and going through

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.310 
reinvent yourself and going through
these<00:02:13.400> rebirth<00:02:14.120> periods<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:14.900> things<00:02:15.110> like

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
these rebirth periods and things like

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.660 
these rebirth periods and things like
that<00:02:15.530> that's<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.220> kind<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.490> where<00:02:16.640> that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
that that's that's kind of where that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.090 
that that's that's kind of where that
comes<00:02:16.940> from<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.750> thought<00:02:18.530> it'd<00:02:18.620> be<00:02:18.650> fitting

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
comes from so I thought it'd be fitting

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.490 
comes from so I thought it'd be fitting
since<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:19.910> been<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.120> seven<00:02:20.570> year<00:02:20.870> law<00:02:21.080> since

objective<00:06:15.610> became<00:06:16.770> got<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.890> focus<00:06:18.070> so<00:06:18.700> focus

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
objective became got to focus so focus

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.460 
objective became got to focus so focus
got<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.510> balance<00:06:19.900> on<00:06:20.080> and<00:06:20.320> so<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:22.090> the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
got to balance on and so the the
