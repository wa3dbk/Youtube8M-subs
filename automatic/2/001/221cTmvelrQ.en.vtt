00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.210
 I come with 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.420
 from the uefa 655 with eric or tito pÃ©rez 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 that keeps making history you have created 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.220
 a trans dana white said that he is not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.500
 fan obviously having fighters 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.169
 entering but that the explanation that you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.090
 you were enough to allow him 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.560
 do this and be special that you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.290
 you said to dana white when they met 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.770
 to comment on your idea as the 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:36.410
 Mexican wrestling is different not that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 that of the USA when I grew up I grew up 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.579
 watching Mexican wrestling not the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.199
 wearing a mask is like a superhero 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.449
 I did not see the fighters as 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.999
 superheroes the one that brings the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:51.749
 put mask is does not mean that you 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:53.579
 you are an anonymous hero can not be 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.499
 any Mexican can be any 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.120
 Latin American who identifies with 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.339
 this is not that when I'm going up 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 ring subo with the mask I come up with everything 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.870
 the town not with all Latinos 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 good in this in this event we have seen 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 that Latinos have actually 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.080
 excelled and are supporting not just 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 hurt cain we saw that actually 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.470
 we are transforming what is the ufc and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 mixed martial arts what does it mean 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.810
 that because you are one of the people 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.049
 What else have I started to be able to achieve as 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.570
 I have always said it is an honor for me 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.130
 represent all the Latin people I'm going 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.340
 to keep fighting this strong while 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.940
 keep supporting me like that and then let's hope 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.300
 join in other parts no longer so much 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.049

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.049

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.140

 little of that hahahaha if I had heard 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.030
 I had heard a bit of that from the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.849
 they have not confirmed for me 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.910
 to be able to say everything right now but now 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.950

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.709
 this league and hopefully that if you do the 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.680
 that yes it is fulfilled right now we are 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.400
 trying was talking doing to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 do that this 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.569
 I hope that those scratched that 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.780
 come the eight fighters and way my 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.430
 gym to see how it is from the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.470
 summer 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.770
 good as you said that is 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.430
 na wai if you said that the possibility of 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.910
 make a UBPCs in Mexico is a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.280
 very real possibility 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.690
 I imagine that obviously I suppose that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.850
 you would be one of the fighters 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.430
 main that would mean to you 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.590
 They are representing Mexico in Mexico and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.750
 the ufc for the first time do not mean 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.330
 many things not to be fighting in the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.530
 most important league around the world in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.530
 my land in my country 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.230

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.300
 strong 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.590

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.180
 2013 I would gladly fight little balls 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.950
