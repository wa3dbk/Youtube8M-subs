00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.860
 let's open it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.560
 prices the price similar to the one we have 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 on the page obviously by the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.190

 the 4 thousand 800 and the 5 thousand 400 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.350
 approximately 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.700
 and well then here is the box that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.159
 we can see is this magnetic the box 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.159
 are two weeks we can see 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.610
 good to start carlos against the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.060
 first let's find here the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.590
 this 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 comes one in an airtight pouch 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.130
 to them 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 comes in brochures you already know about warranty and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.450
 this and they were inspired by 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.379
 do these hearing aids in fact this is 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.069
 says that the hearing aids were for us 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.800
 all the people who work there that's why 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.550
 they call inspiration here we have the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.170
 and also that we can exchange them 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.300
 these headphones bring some similar to 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.390
 but we can put them to this 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.680
 that brings as peaks I do not know no longer these 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.890
 You can buy them directly in the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.890
 store 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.379
 this one that brings as a quick guide 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.770
 and also bring in a fiber to clean 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.190
 the hearing aids the mind has made of 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.190
 label 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:02.410
 well that's what the box brings and here 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.410
 we can see already what is this good the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.170
 leather backpack 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.090
 and it smells in fact not trying to brand 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.090
 of monsters and his clip 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680
 and here we can see the hearing aids 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.950
 it's like you can not be like a sponge 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.950
 dita 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.780
 as affected and here we have two batteries 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.630
 the allianz are hard, they do not give you the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.920
 rock that will finish these honduras the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.590
 fourth I explain why and good here 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.890
 we have what are the cables that 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.890
 He said 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.760
 this cable that is the mini 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.090
 the cables with this with the controls 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.129
 as you can see here are one for ipods 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.140
 ipads or everything that has to do with 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.670
 one 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.870
 with the saga of brands and these that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.870
 they are for android 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.360
 and well what we can see is that they are 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.480
 they are such heavy headphones 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.000
 they are white they have like a cloth they 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.000
 feels quite santurtzi with the truth 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.250
 we can see this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.249
 as a week what they open for different 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.379
 head size types 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:41.129
 and well here obviously it goes in what they are 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:45.149
 this the cables because we can see that 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:48.449
 that move this average seems to me very 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.549
 good and ok so that the batteries these 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.189
 hearing aids already bring sound cancellation 

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:56.429
 they say it's a sound cancellation 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:59.729
 pretty good this is actually very 

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:03.359
 superior to that of sony sennheiser there will be 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:07.230
 what to see I handle a few in high 

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:09.390
 share and good here I will teach you 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.800
 this removes the 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.680
 a diadem 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.030
 here I bring you other companies are 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.389
 same 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.780
 this is like more than bone with a little 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.720
 more opaque 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.639
 and good that nothing else you this for 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.590
 the goal to see there is 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.590
 and it's also magnetic type 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:40.930
 well this was now if a kick boxing 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.270
 of what you can find in these 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.060
 hearing aids we will have to prove it we have 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.590
 the beats will be pretty good I guess 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.300
 that these should be heard a little 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.300
 better so nothing until later
