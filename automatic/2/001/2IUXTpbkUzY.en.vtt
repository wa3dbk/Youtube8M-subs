00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.890
 closed with a 2 in victory against PSV 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.980
 vitesse a series of difficult but beautiful 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.769
 matches against duels against az 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.740
 twente ajax nec is now waiting for a competition 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.720
 against flying low from the premier division 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 pore cz with 10 points on the sixteenth 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 place but it always remains a whole 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.980
 awkward opponent 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.890
 yes it is also tell me so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.710
 there could be an attacker in a middle that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 which is almost always your escort 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 good striker who can do it from scratch 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 can honestly make a goal so that there is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 very sharp and then we must be very alert 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 I think 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 and so a run up to the competition 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.270
 have become against and anbe boys 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 the selection that even more than others 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 boys have an eye on how difficult 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.350
 this competition is the child there 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 of course already a number of players with that 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.320
 those who want to have the experience of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.039
 of a series of this type of competition 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.539
 and now comes the last block of tears and how 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.470
 the hay that last block good too 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 shut down 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 Vitesse has an excellent medical 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.780
 staff and it shows because the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 arnhemse have few this season 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 physical problems then you as a club 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 of course also be lucky 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 players do not get injured before 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 next Sunday everyone is fit 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 except walk of the bush that does the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 is heading in the right direction 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.240
 this moment is frank van der struijk 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.590
 yes who can be very careful here 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.630
 many training sessions do more 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 yes on session assignment percent of the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 trainers in food and obsessive cent 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 are able 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 well there goes when you greet so one 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 spacious everyone beyond the shape of the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 strip all everyone just fit 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 roda jc is a team that and some 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.350
 matches cheeky and others 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.299
 matches just leans back and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 is watching the counter 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.470
 what roda expect big sunday 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.440
 get an overview 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 I don't think they just like that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.410
 opening his play mat makes that 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.500
 they will definitely not do either 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.350
 from the closed closed in one 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.820
 they will operate but I have 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.710
 for example we are against feyenoord 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.690
 seen in the kitchen and there they play 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.520
 very cheeky very boost though cheeky to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.220
 forward also gets a number 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.540
 decent opportunities and there you will find 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.950
 I here that result is what it was 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.840
 flattered 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.060
 against vitesse last year 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 with roda it then became five zero 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.850
 now the cross low and regardless of 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 ginkle 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.110
 Captain Pasha made the second 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.880
 hit 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.120
 that waking solo and that his own 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120
 half 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 make the other geological vitessenaar 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.380
 you get the 3 0 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.600
 santoria 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.430
 yes and inside definitely don't have vitesse 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.290
 rsa definitely get the arnhemmers too 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.820
 still a penalty as thorium 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.820
 torpedoed by vormer 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.270
 alexander bÃ¼ttner within the penalty kick 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.270
 and then it's 4 0 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.220

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.290
 and he may go down stairs to take a look 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.290
