i'm reviewing for you today is the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.849 
i'm reviewing for you today is the
motive<00:00:53.250> rail<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:54.980> is<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.430> would<00:00:56.820> say<00:00:57.239> about

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
motive rail it is i would say about

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.680 
motive rail it is i would say about
looks<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.129> almost<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> foot<00:00:59.789> long<00:01:00.030> which

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
looks like it's almost a foot long which

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.579 
looks like it's almost a foot long which
is<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.350> decent<00:01:02.129> size<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> ask<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.530> now<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
is a decent size if you ask me now you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
is a decent size if you ask me now you
can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.430> black<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.720> it's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
can see that it is black but it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
can see that it is black but it's
actually<00:01:07.049> aluminum<00:01:08.030> what<00:01:09.030> he<00:01:09.180> does<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.630> has

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
actually aluminum what he does is he has

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
actually aluminum what he does is he has
this<00:01:10.080> process<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.770> believe<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.070> called

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this process i believe it's called

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.179 
this process i believe it's called
anodizing<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> he<00:01:13.860> shoots

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
anodizing and what that is is he shoots

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.149 
anodizing and what that is is he shoots
an<00:01:14.460> electrical<00:01:15.270> current<00:01:15.750> through<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.920> metal

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
an electrical current through the metal

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.910 
an electrical current through the metal
which<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.299> gives<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.259> color<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
which actually gives it this color and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.149 
which actually gives it this color and
it<00:01:20.340> makes<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.509> aluminum<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.320> times<00:01:22.619> stronger

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it makes the aluminum two times stronger

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.280 
it makes the aluminum two times stronger
than<00:01:23.549> steel<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.390> still<00:01:25.130> extremely<00:01:26.130> light

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
than steel but still extremely light

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
than steel but still extremely light
very<00:01:28.290> durable<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.860> well<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.299> with

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
very durable as well now with it with

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
very durable as well now with it with
the<00:01:30.600> anodizing<00:01:31.290> changing<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> color<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the anodizing changing the color of the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990 
the anodizing changing the color of the
metal<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.509> won't<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> worry<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
metal you won't have to worry about the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
metal you won't have to worry about the
the<00:01:36.390> color<00:01:36.630> coming<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.170> because<00:01:37.650> i've<00:01:37.860> been

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the color coming off because i've been

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.030 
the color coming off because i've been
searching<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.610> rail<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.930> days<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
searching this rail for days and I the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.080 
searching this rail for days and I the
only<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.520> I've<00:01:41.579> noticed<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:42.060> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
only thing that I've noticed is that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
only thing that I've noticed is that
yeah<00:01:42.899> every<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> will<00:01:43.770> leave<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> scratch<00:01:44.310> here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
yeah every it will leave a scratch here

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
yeah every it will leave a scratch here
and<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and there but it's not going to be a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
and there but it's not going to be a
noticeable<00:01:47.549> scratch<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.780> metal<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
noticeable scratch because the metal is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.249 
noticeable scratch because the metal is
all<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> same<00:01:49.740> color<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.840> think

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
all the same color so that one I think

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.539 
all the same color so that one I think
is<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:54.409> nice<00:01:55.409> addition<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.219> product

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
is a very nice addition to this product

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
is a very nice addition to this product
that<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> won't<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> worry<00:01:57.329> about<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that you won't have to worry about it

what type of surface you put it on you

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.610 
what type of surface you put it on you
will<00:02:42.290> always<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:43.010> stable<00:02:43.490> rail<00:02:44.270> at<00:02:44.630> any

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
will always have a stable rail at any

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.600 
will always have a stable rail at any
angle<00:02:46.840> because<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.990> it's<00:02:48.230> round<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.490> you

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
angle because it's it's round so if you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.280 
angle because it's it's round so if you
have<00:02:49.730> like<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:49.940> box<00:02:50.210> here<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.990> then<00:02:51.080> you<00:02:51.140> have

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
have like a box here and then you have

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.290 
have like a box here and then you have
your<00:02:51.320> surf<00:02:51.680> your<00:02:51.860> landing<00:02:52.250> surface<00:02:52.460> you<00:02:53.120> could

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
your surf your landing surface you could

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.080 
your surf your landing surface you could
put<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.840> end<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.350> rail<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.580> box<00:02:55.790> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
put one end of the rail on the box and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.250 
put one end of the rail on the box and
then<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.300> other<00:02:56.330> end<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> rail<00:02:56.960> on<00:02:57.140> the

landing surface and it will always
remain<00:02:59.510> stable<00:02:59.950> I've<00:03:00.950> tried<00:03:01.400> this<00:03:01.580> prop<00:03:01.880> this

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
remain stable I've tried this prop this

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.240 
remain stable I've tried this prop this
uh<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.720> doing<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.410> before<00:03:03.770> with<00:03:03.860> one<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> my

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
uh this doing this before with one of my

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.010 
uh this doing this before with one of my
flat<00:03:04.640> rails<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.870> flat<00:03:06.430> footings<00:03:07.430> and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
flat rails that have flat footings and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.220 
flat rails that have flat footings and
it<00:03:09.020> kind<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.440> like<00:03:10.150> loses<00:03:11.150> its<00:03:11.390> stability

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
it kind of like loses its stability

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.460 
it kind of like loses its stability
because<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.550> not<00:03:13.730> sitting<00:03:14.030> flat<00:03:14.390> on<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
because it's not sitting flat on the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.940 
because it's not sitting flat on the
surface<00:03:15.500> or<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:16.670> these<00:03:16.820> round<00:03:17.240> feet<00:03:17.950> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
surface or with these round feet it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.010 
surface or with these round feet it
doesn't<00:03:19.280> matter<00:03:19.340> what<00:03:20.090> angle<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:20.630> put<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.930> on

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
doesn't matter what angle you put it on

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.720 
doesn't matter what angle you put it on
even<00:03:21.380> if<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.530> put<00:03:21.709> like<00:03:21.890> this<00:03:22.100> you<00:03:22.370> will<00:03:22.550> still

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
even if you put like this you will still

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.940 
even if you put like this you will still
have<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.860> stable<00:03:25.390> rail<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:27.080> ingenious

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
have a stable rail it's it's ingenious

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.620 
have a stable rail it's it's ingenious
what<00:03:28.580> he<00:03:28.790> decided<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.270> do<00:03:29.390> with<00:03:29.540> these

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
what he decided to do with these

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.680 
what he decided to do with these
footings<00:03:30.010> also<00:03:31.010> underneath<00:03:31.940> here<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.450> don't

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
footings also underneath here I don't

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.199 
footings also underneath here I don't
know<00:03:32.750> if<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.900> could<00:03:33.050> see<00:03:33.290> there<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.520> a<00:03:34.790> hole

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
know if you could see there is a hole

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.750 
know if you could see there is a hole
right<00:03:35.540> there<00:03:36.160> pretty<00:03:37.160> sure<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.430> guys<00:03:37.490> could

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
right there pretty sure you guys could

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.910 
right there pretty sure you guys could
see<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.360> then<00:03:38.930> there's<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.140> screw<00:03:39.530> inside

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
see that and then there's a screw inside

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.760 
see that and then there's a screw inside
now<00:03:40.880> when<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.510> order<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.020> rail<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.560> comes

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
now when you order the rail and it comes

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.770 
now when you order the rail and it comes
to<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.730> do<00:03:44.030> some<00:03:44.239> assembling

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
you just have to put the feet on but he

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.820 
you just have to put the feet on but he
also<00:03:47.150> did<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:47.750> for<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.020> reason<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.709> was

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830

to save you guys on shipping because now
instead<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.700> sending<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.630> rail<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.350> box

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590
