00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 there are four techniques of obtaining one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.839
 urine sample for analysis a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
 simple method of obtaining a sample 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.030
 is when urinating the animal is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 spontaneous driving the disadvantages of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 this method are mainly the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 possibility of contamination of the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.390
 shows due to contact with the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.220
 external genitalia and also only 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.200
 You can get the sample at the moment 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.330
 that the animal urges voluntarily 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.640
 the second technique is compression 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.010
 manual bladder which is a method that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.750
 can cause robot ism and should not 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 be used on animals with a bladder 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 pathological or a urethral obstruction 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.240
 there is also the possibility of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.540
 contamination of the sample due to 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.070
 contact with the external genitalia 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.250
 third method is catheterization 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.680
 urethral risk of trauma 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.770
 associated with this piercing method or 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.390
 knotting of the bladder catheter and a 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.220
 contamination risk if the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.730
 Sterility is maintained during 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.730
 execution 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 the fourth way to get urine for 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.470
 his analysis is through the acys 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.060
 teacher if this technique is easy and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.560
 has the advantage of allowing the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 Obtaining a sample in a way 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.650
 aseptic 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.840
 the observed changes has to effect the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.000
 analyzes will be confined to the device 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 urinary due to the fact of avoiding 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.619
 contact with the reproductive system 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 this method requires that the bladder have 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.820
 a sufficient volume of urine 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 contamination of the sample with blood 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.690
 it can happen if it penetrates 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.000
 accidentally blood vessels to 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 penetrating the abdominal wall or scraping 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 the surface of the bladder mucosa 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.960
 if necessary, it can be generally 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 differentiate between a hemorrhage 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.750
 accidental and a true hematuria 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.460
 the complementary analysis of urine 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.460
 obtained by spontaneous urination 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.550
 Teachers should be avoided after 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.550
 a cystectomy 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.509
 to get urine by cis teachers is 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.509
 locate the bladder by palpation 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.810
 use a 23 gauge needle and 2 to 3 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.500
 centimeters long and a syringe 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.140
 having a capacity of 20 milliliters 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.080
 It is recommended to insert the needle into a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.080
 45 degree angle against the wall 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.600
 abdominal in the ventral aspect or inside 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.600
 lateral of the bladder and in one direction 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.880
 cow dorsal 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.140
 this angle minimizes the escape of urine 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.140
 does the abdominal cavity 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.310
 finally deposit the urine in a 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.019
 sterile container in this way you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.410
 have a urine sample ready to 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.980
 be evaluated 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.660
 if a bacteriological analysis is desired 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 replace the needle that was used for the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.520
 puncture with a sterile needle before 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.890
 introduce it into the sterile container 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.880
 here a sterile glass tube is used 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.680
 under vacuum if anticoagulant take note of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.110
 that first the tube plug is cleaned 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.060
 with gauze soaked in alcohol before 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.970
 to work through the plug with the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.500
 needle to transfer urine 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.330
 transfer the remaining urine to a 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.330
 second container for analysis 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.550
 urethral catheterization requires a 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.220
 aseptic technique a little sterile gel 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.140
 the end of the catheter is applied to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.590
 facilitate its administration to the interior 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.590
 of the urethra 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.970
 the animal is characterized 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.310
 can exert gentle pressure on the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.050
 bladder to facilitate the collection of 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.680
 urinate directly into a container 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.680
 sterile 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.500
 finally the collection of urine by 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.849
 the method of spontaneous urination allows 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.849
 take a walk outside
