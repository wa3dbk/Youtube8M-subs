00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.780 

I<00:01:34.159> had<00:01:34.700> some<00:01:34.939> heavy<00:01:35.119> duty<00:01:35.330> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I had some heavy duty and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
I had some heavy duty and
real<00:01:35.940> strength<00:01:36.330> reflective<00:01:36.870> strips<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> fit

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
real strength reflective strips that fit

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.710 
real strength reflective strips that fit
nicely<00:01:37.800> on<00:01:38.100> either<00:01:38.250> side<00:01:38.550> of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.790> case<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.690> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
nicely on either side of the case so I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.310 
nicely on either side of the case so I
attached<00:01:40.080> them<00:01:40.290> also<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.890> added<00:01:41.220> visibility

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
attached them also for added visibility

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
attached them also for added visibility
the<00:01:43.320> reflector<00:01:43.800> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> lid<00:01:44.220> isn't<00:01:44.610> lighted

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the reflector on the lid isn't lighted

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520 
the reflector on the lid isn't lighted
but<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.300> sure<00:01:45.480> looks<00:01:45.720> perfect<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.380> LED

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
but it sure looks perfect for an LED

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130 
but it sure looks perfect for an LED
array<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.880> bet<00:01:48.090> someone<00:01:48.480> will<00:01:48.510> develop<00:01:49.050> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
array and I bet someone will develop a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.670 
array and I bet someone will develop a
light<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:51.330> case<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.780> 35<00:01:52.290> litres

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
light for it the case has 35 litres

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
light for it the case has 35 litres
