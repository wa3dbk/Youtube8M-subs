 the top of the wall is something very 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.149
 strange because the feeding of these 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 machines is done through cables 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.060
 by imperceptible cables to the point 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.399
