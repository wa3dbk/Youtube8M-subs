00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the also singles but at the same time

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.600 
the also singles but at the same time
you<00:01:58.110> need<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.100> confidence

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
you need to get it because a confidence

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.130 
you need to get it because a confidence
by<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.729> same<00:01:59.969> time<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> rest

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
by the same time you need to rest

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.319 
by the same time you need to rest
you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> even<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.909> do

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you know even more and get you know do

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
you know even more and get you know do
energy<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> singles<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.829> well<00:02:05.009> because

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
energy for the singles as well because

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.459 
energy for the singles as well because
you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.329> suffer<00:02:06.750> maybe<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.350> bit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you can also suffer maybe a little bit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.100 
you can also suffer maybe a little bit
at<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> end<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.879> she<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
at the end but I think she is

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.450 
at the end but I think she is
had<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.320> good<00:02:10.530> partner<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
had a good partner you know with the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.970 
had a good partner you know with the
stance<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.930> think<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.530> playing<00:02:13.740> really

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
stance and I think they playing really

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
stance and I think they playing really
well<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.430> maybe<00:02:14.610> help<00:02:15.150> her<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:15.840> like

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
well and maybe help her to get more like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.280 
well and maybe help her to get more like
the<00:02:16.260> pressure<00:02:17.390> having<00:02:18.390> good<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.170> know

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the pressure having good you know

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.600 
the pressure having good you know
matches<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:20.280> she<00:02:20.460> would<00:02:20.580> be

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
matches going and then but she would be

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.400 
matches going and then but she would be
ready<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> finals<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.720> fun<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.110> ranch

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you will see the pictures she wasn't

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.590 
you will see the pictures she wasn't
feeling<00:02:32.220> overly<00:02:32.760> well<00:02:32.910> today<00:02:33.210> there<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
feeling overly well today there was a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.050 
feeling overly well today there was a
lot<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.900> coughing<00:02:34.140> going<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.190> she's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
lot of coughing going on and she's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.600 
lot of coughing going on and she's
obviously<00:02:36.630> got<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> bit<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.260> cold<00:02:37.470> which<00:02:38.459> is

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
obviously got a bit of a cold which is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.750 
obviously got a bit of a cold which is
not<00:02:38.760> ideal<00:02:38.910> well<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.530> maybe<00:02:40.890> as<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.520> see

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
not ideal well I think maybe as I see

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.970 
not ideal well I think maybe as I see
you<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:42.030> she's<00:02:43.020> not<00:02:43.200> feeling<00:02:43.500> too<00:02:43.530> good<00:02:43.770> but

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you know she's not feeling too good but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.000 
you know she's not feeling too good but
maybe<00:02:44.610> she<00:02:44.940> will<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.570> know<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:46.140> ready<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.620> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
maybe she will you know get ready to it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.960 
maybe she will you know get ready to it
doesn't<00:02:47.250> bother<00:02:47.490> her

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
doesn't bother her

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910 
doesn't bother her
into<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.360> semi-finals<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> worst

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
into the semi-finals but it's the worst

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.979 
into the semi-finals but it's the worst
moment<00:02:50.310> ever<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.730> know<00:02:50.820> because<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.540> think

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
moment ever you know because I think

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.199 
moment ever you know because I think
that<00:02:52.260> she<00:02:52.980> went<00:02:53.160> through<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.610> much<00:02:53.790> during<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that she went through so much during the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.140 
that she went through so much during the
you<00:02:54.360> know<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> whole<00:02:54.989> two<00:02:55.920> weeks<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.489> maybe<00:02:57.030> I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
you know the whole two weeks and maybe I

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.880 
you know the whole two weeks and maybe I
don't<00:02:57.390> know<00:02:57.480> we'll<00:02:57.810> see<00:02:58.050> how<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> goes<00:02:58.560> during

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
don't know we'll see how it goes during

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.830 
don't know we'll see how it goes during
the<00:02:59.070> match<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.640> hopefully<00:03:00.150> she<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> play<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the match but hopefully she can play the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.960 
the match but hopefully she can play the
whole<00:03:00.959> match<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.830> happens<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.790> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
whole match you know it happens and it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.729 
whole match you know it happens and it's
almost<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.420> possible<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.989> her<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.320> keep<00:03:04.500> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
almost not possible for her to keep the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.640 
almost not possible for her to keep the
points<00:03:05.070> shorter<00:03:05.700> because<00:03:05.970> she<00:03:06.390> doesn't<00:03:07.200> play

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
points shorter because she doesn't play

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.770 
points shorter because she doesn't play
a<00:03:07.680> lot<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.100> long<00:03:08.280> points<00:03:08.730> anyway<00:03:09.090> she<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> think

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
a lot of long points anyway she I think

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.840 
a lot of long points anyway she I think
that<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.260> her<00:03:10.590> surf<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.100> know<00:03:11.220> is<00:03:11.430> helping<00:03:11.580> her

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
that if her surf you know is helping her

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.880 
that if her surf you know is helping her
like<00:03:12.150> always<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.780> win<00:03:13.050> three<00:03:13.410> points<00:03:13.770> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
like always and win three points and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.100 
like always and win three points and
maybe<00:03:14.100> going<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.030> first<00:03:15.299> second<00:03:15.930> shot

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
maybe going for the first second shot

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720 
maybe going for the first second shot
you<00:03:16.260> know<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.500> winners<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.920> she<00:03:17.100> does<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
you know like winners like she does and

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.250 
you know like winners like she does and
he<00:03:17.880> goes<00:03:18.030> fast<00:03:18.330> she<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> live<00:03:19.170> in

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
he goes fast she can have a live in

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.900 
he goes fast she can have a live in
little<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.160> more<00:03:20.340> chance<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.760> win

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
little you know more chance to win

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
little you know more chance to win
faster<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.780> goes<00:03:21.930> long<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.920> other<00:03:23.010> you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
faster but if it goes long the other you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.770 
faster but if it goes long the other you
know<00:03:23.370> ever<00:03:23.730> since<00:03:23.760> Keys<00:03:24.090> playing<00:03:24.330> pretty<00:03:24.600> well

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
know ever since Keys playing pretty well

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.690 
know ever since Keys playing pretty well
and<00:03:25.049> if<00:03:25.440> he<00:03:25.590> knows<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.010> she's<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:26.489> bit

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
and if he knows that she's a little bit

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.490 
and if he knows that she's a little bit
ill<00:03:26.970> she<00:03:27.299> can<00:03:27.450> move<00:03:27.600> around<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.140> we'll<00:03:28.320> see

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
ill she can move around and we'll see

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.289 
ill she can move around and we'll see
how<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> goes<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.160> hopefully<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.150> can

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
how it goes but hopefully they can

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.580 
how it goes but hopefully they can
finish<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.720> whole<00:03:30.870> match<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> most
