00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
using this so I got it in the color tan

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.710 
using this so I got it in the color tan
glow<00:00:24.360> I<00:00:25.280> personally<00:00:26.280> really<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.570> um

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
glow I personally really like this um

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
glow I personally really like this um
it's<00:00:30.720> cheap<00:00:31.200> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.770> it's<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.189> eleven

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
it's cheap I think it's like eleven

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020 
it's cheap I think it's like eleven
twelve<00:00:33.270> dollars<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:34.020> Target<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.530> Ulta<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.460> even

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
twelve dollars at Target or Ulta or even

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.329 
twelve dollars at Target or Ulta or even
Walmart<00:00:36.239> might<00:00:36.539> be<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.839> ten<00:00:37.050> dollars<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.769> I

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
Walmart might be like ten dollars but I

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.180 
Walmart might be like ten dollars but I
think<00:00:38.519> it<00:00:38.609> works<00:00:38.820> great<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.440> comes<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.159> off

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
think it works great it comes right off

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.880 
think it works great it comes right off
right<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.969> take<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.269> shower<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.409> I<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
right when you take a shower so I like

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.709 
right when you take a shower so I like
that<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.219> well<00:00:44.429> it<00:00:44.730> says<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.449> that<00:00:45.480> it's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that as well it says here that it's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
that as well it says here that it's
water-resistant<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.769> that's<00:00:46.890> another<00:00:47.129> good

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
water-resistant so that's another good

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.399 
water-resistant so that's another good
thing<00:00:47.429> you<00:00:48.269> can<00:00:48.449> go<00:00:48.629> into<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> pool<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.390> I

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
thing you can go into the pool and I

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.389 
thing you can go into the pool and I
guess<00:00:52.409> they<00:00:52.530> won't<00:00:52.710> come<00:00:52.859> off<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.100> haven't

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
guess they won't come off I haven't

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.919 
guess they won't come off I haven't
tried<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.579> yet<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.909> I'm<00:00:54.269> not<00:00:54.420> saying<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
tried that yet so I'm not saying that

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.020 
tried that yet so I'm not saying that
that's<00:00:55.109> what<00:00:55.229> it'll<00:00:55.469> do<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.699> does<00:00:56.879> say

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's what it'll do but it does say

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.579 
that's what it'll do but it does say
it's<00:00:57.179> water-resistant<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.929> was<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.499> think

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
it's water-resistant I was like I think

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.559 
it's water-resistant I was like I think
there's<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.979> three<00:00:59.370> other<00:00:59.729> different

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.610 

colors<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.110> eye<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
colors and this eye thing that the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.530 
colors and this eye thing that the
medium<00:01:04.979> color<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.370> like<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> deep<00:01:05.760> dark<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.360> deep

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
medium color is like a deep dark or deep

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
medium color is like a deep dark or deep
deep<00:01:07.200> tan<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.829> I<00:01:07.860> didn't<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.219> that<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.579> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
deep tan but I didn't get that one a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
deep tan but I didn't get that one a
little<00:01:09.390> scared<00:01:09.659> let<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:09.899> get<00:01:10.020> too<00:01:10.229> dark<00:01:10.469> but<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
little scared let me get too dark but I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.319 
little scared let me get too dark but I
think<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.250> might<00:01:11.399> try<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.759> one<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
think I might try that one because this

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.359 
think I might try that one because this
one's<00:01:12.570> nice<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.320> maybe<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.920> myself<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
one's nice but maybe to get myself a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.639 
one's nice but maybe to get myself a
deeper<00:01:15.000> tan<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.270> might<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.170> but

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
deeper tan I might get the other one but
