easier today we're gonna be focusing on
how<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> give<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:07.770> images<00:00:08.130> some<00:00:08.309> extra<00:00:08.730> depth

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
how to give our images some extra depth

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.390 
how to give our images some extra depth
in<00:00:09.240> Adobe<00:00:09.660> Photoshop<00:00:09.980> using<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.040> technique

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
in Adobe Photoshop using a technique

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:23.540 
in Adobe Photoshop using a technique
called<00:00:11.460> dodge<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> burn<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.630> stay<00:00:12.870> tuned

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.680 

now<00:00:24.550> this<00:00:24.700> John<00:00:24.850> John<00:00:25.060> Byrne's<00:00:25.240> technique<00:00:25.570> is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
now this John John Byrne's technique is

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.420 
now this John John Byrne's technique is
relatively<00:00:26.170> simple<00:00:26.440> all<00:00:26.710> you're<00:00:27.040> using<00:00:27.070> is

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
relatively simple all you're using is

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.950 
relatively simple all you're using is
adjustment<00:00:28.000> layers<00:00:28.150> in<00:00:28.390> order<00:00:28.510> to<00:00:28.720> give<00:00:28.840> your

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
adjustment layers in order to give your

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.359 
adjustment layers in order to give your
images<00:00:29.320> some<00:00:29.500> extra<00:00:29.890> depth<00:00:30.099> you're

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
images some extra depth you're

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.400 
images some extra depth you're
effectively<00:00:30.910> using<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.420> curves<00:00:31.900> adjustment

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
effectively using the curves adjustment

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.020 
effectively using the curves adjustment
layer<00:00:32.439> notice<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.340> give<00:00:33.460> your<00:00:33.610> images<00:00:33.880> some

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
extra dimension now let's just jump

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.770 
extra dimension now let's just jump
straight<00:00:36.340> into<00:00:36.520> Photoshop<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.300> see<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.660> in

there go up to the curves option we're
gonna<00:00:56.050> do<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.320> twice<00:00:56.610> you're<00:00:57.610> gonna<00:00:57.699> create

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
gonna do that twice you're gonna create

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.850 
gonna do that twice you're gonna create
two<00:00:58.089> new<00:00:58.269> curves<00:00:58.780> layers<00:00:59.110> right<00:00:59.470> above<00:00:59.710> your

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
two new curves layers right above your

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.289 
two new curves layers right above your
background<00:01:00.339> we're<00:01:00.850> gonna<00:01:00.940> go<00:01:01.030> ahead<00:01:01.089> and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
background we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.410 
background we're gonna go ahead and
double<00:01:01.540> click<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:02.170> curves<00:01:02.710> one<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.760> label<00:01:04.330> it

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
double click the curves one and label it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.930 
double click the curves one and label it
darken<00:01:04.780> we're<00:01:05.650> gonna<00:01:05.770> label<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.460> curves<00:01:06.820> to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
darken we're gonna label it curves to

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.240 
darken we're gonna label it curves to
lighten<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.170> do<00:01:08.229> that<00:01:08.470> for<00:01:08.620> organizations

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
lighten and I do that for organizations

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.140 
lighten and I do that for organizations
so<00:01:09.490> save<00:01:09.820> yourself<00:01:10.180> any<00:01:10.479> mental<00:01:11.320> strain<00:01:11.799> on

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so save yourself any mental strain on

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180 
so save yourself any mental strain on
figuring<00:01:13.150> out<00:01:13.240> what<00:01:13.690> needs<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.049> be<00:01:14.200> done<00:01:14.320> next

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
figuring out what needs to be done next

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.530 
figuring out what needs to be done next
thing<00:01:15.430> we're<00:01:15.520> gonna<00:01:15.610> do<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:15.880> select<00:01:16.210> our

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
thing we're gonna do is select our

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.580 
thing we're gonna do is select our
darkened<00:01:17.140> layer<00:01:17.320> on<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:18.250> curves<00:01:18.580> side<00:01:19.060> here

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
darkened layer on the curves side here

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.780 
darkened layer on the curves side here
now<00:01:20.590> if<00:01:20.830> you've<00:01:20.950> never<00:01:21.010> used<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.490> histogram

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
now if you've never used a histogram

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.700 
now if you've never used a histogram
that's<00:01:22.090> extremely<00:01:22.479> simple<00:01:22.900> our<00:01:23.320> left-hand

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
that's extremely simple our left-hand

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.249 
that's extremely simple our left-hand
side<00:01:24.040> is<00:01:24.310> how<00:01:24.610> many<00:01:24.790> shadow<00:01:25.270> pixels<00:01:25.780> or<00:01:25.930> darker

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
side is how many shadow pixels or darker

pixels we have our mid-tones and our
highlights<00:01:28.829> extremely<00:01:29.829> simple<00:01:30.189> now<00:01:30.789> what

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
highlights extremely simple now what

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.399 
highlights extremely simple now what
we're<00:01:31.359> gonna<00:01:31.479> do<00:01:31.659> for<00:01:31.810> our<00:01:31.840> darkened<00:01:32.259> layers

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
we're gonna do for our darkened layers

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.399 
we're gonna do for our darkened layers
just<00:01:32.710> select<00:01:33.280> our<00:01:33.460> mid-tones<00:01:33.939> drag<00:01:34.899> down<00:01:35.229> to

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
just select our mid-tones drag down to

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.209 
just select our mid-tones drag down to
underexpose

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
underexpose

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.300 
underexpose
and<00:01:36.960> once<00:01:37.960> we're<00:01:38.170> happy<00:01:38.619> with<00:01:38.979> where<00:01:39.159> we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
and once we're happy with where we're

and once we're happy with where we're
gonna<00:01:39.369> be<00:01:39.579> underexposed<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:40.359> generally<00:01:40.869> like

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
gonna be underexposed I generally like

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.169 
gonna be underexposed I generally like
images<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:42.369> have<00:01:43.619> darker<00:01:44.619> shadows<00:01:45.429> that<00:01:45.969> have

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
images to have darker shadows that have

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.120 
images to have darker shadows that have
not<00:01:46.450> faded<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.020> black<00:01:47.049> that's<00:01:47.590> kind<00:01:47.859> of<00:01:47.920> how<00:01:48.100> I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
not faded to black that's kind of how I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.300 
not faded to black that's kind of how I
judge<00:01:49.060> where<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.749> an<00:01:49.869> appropriate<00:01:50.170> marker<00:01:50.770> so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
judge where is an appropriate marker so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.429 
judge where is an appropriate marker so
generally<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:52.119> generally<00:01:52.840> bring<00:01:53.049> it<00:01:53.140> down<00:01:53.289> to

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
generally I generally bring it down to
