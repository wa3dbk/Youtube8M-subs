 now in civilization 5 too 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.350
 one of the new peoples in the youngest 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.719
 change brave new world is namely 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.430
 portugal with its head maria the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.450
 first 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.039
 Based on these pictures we can also 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.950
 one of the great innovations of the addons 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 demonstrate the trade with caravans 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.070
 and we are allowed to dream with others 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.910
 nations act as our cash register 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.530
 ring 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.140
 except that spread on this 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.489
 away religion and culture the cultural 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 most influential nations in the world too 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.840
 his is one of the extended victory 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 conditions with world-wondering artworks 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 and archeological hard facts can 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.740
 our dominance in this field 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.440
 Remove 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.000
 apropos archeology we can researcher 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.620
 Send to the archaeological site where you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.730
 antiques dig up ours 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 Increase culture 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.079
 We sometimes find artifacts 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.070
 from our own game story 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.899
 for example, arrowheads from a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.640
 previous battle at this point 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.450
 that has increased the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 the atmosphere 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.290
 who prefer his enemies, however 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.670
 politically dominated the pleased about 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.110
 the United Nations 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.579
 they already existed in the main game 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.680
 but only as largely 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.299
 functionless facility now we can 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 there are regular resolutions to 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.440
 submit vote about weapons 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.960
 trade embargoes or 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.880
 environmental laws or and compared to 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.400
 let world presidents vote and thus 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 win the game 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.340
 a possibility our position in the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 United nations to strengthen are the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 new diplomat if we are a spy in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.440
 placing a capital starts 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 with whom we can not be in the war 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.100
 we appoint him as a diplomat 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 he does not play any technologies 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.470
 but we get more for it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.150
 information about it like that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.659
 concerned people to our resolution 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.130
 stands 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.510
 by bribery or 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.070
 We can then intimidate it 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.720
 maybe convince for us 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 agree 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.710
 In addition to Portugal, there are eight more new ones 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.900
 Civilizations here solo with theirs 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.729
 chief shark and he tells us 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.680
 the same time the war because if culture 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.810
 And diplomacy fails, of course 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 still the oldest of all means 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.259
 to get rid of his enemies 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.259
 the fight on the battlefield
