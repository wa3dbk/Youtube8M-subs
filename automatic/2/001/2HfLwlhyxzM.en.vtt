doing<00:01:22.670> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> why<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.540> Zim<00:01:24.689> -<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.259> decided<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
doing this is why for Zim - I decided to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
doing this is why for Zim - I decided to
focus<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.670> software<00:01:27.000> side<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
focus more on the software side of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
focus more on the software side of
things<00:01:27.530> for<00:01:28.530> Zim<00:01:28.650> two's<00:01:28.860> hardware<00:01:29.280> solution<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
things for Zim two's hardware solution I

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
things for Zim two's hardware solution I
decided<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> modified<00:01:31.439> controller

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
decided to go with a modified controller

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
decided to go with a modified controller

that can be controlled by a PC this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
that can be controlled by a PC this
