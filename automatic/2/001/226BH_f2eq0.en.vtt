actually<00:05:37.570> on<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.690> game<00:05:37.870> would<00:05:38.020> end<00:05:38.050> so

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
actually on the game would end so

another<00:05:38.620> good<00:05:38.830> win<00:05:38.980> for<00:05:39.010> us<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.520> think<00:05:39.640> we<00:05:39.820> were

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
another good win for us I think we were

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.870 
another good win for us I think we were
like<00:05:40.650> three<00:05:41.650> or<00:05:41.770> four<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.070> one<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.370> on<00:05:42.700> this

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
like three or four and one and on this

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.580 
like three or four and one and on this
episode<00:05:43.060> thankful<00:05:43.600> on<00:05:43.720> one<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:44.110> don't<00:05:44.500> really

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590

count<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.070> loss<00:05:45.610> but<00:05:45.790> I<00:05:45.850> got<00:05:45.940> disconnected

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330
