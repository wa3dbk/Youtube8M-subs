we've<00:01:27.539> seen<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.140> prison<00:01:28.319> already<00:01:29.030> if<00:01:30.030> we

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
we've seen them in prison already if we

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.900

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.320 
finished it after season 2 that would
have<00:01:36.119> been<00:01:36.149> well<00:01:36.660> better<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.729> need<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.270> a
