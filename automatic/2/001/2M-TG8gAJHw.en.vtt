00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.050
 besides bovinocultura west the andes 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.450
 large field is being widely 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.419
 used in other food 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.390
 various animal species and fertilize 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.000
 many areas of agriculture in the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.490
 hortifruti farm harmony for example 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.340
 find in terenos mato grosso do sul 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.170
 the results are fantastic in this area 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.080
 of 250 hectares 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.360
 the legume is harvested crushed and 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.130
 offered directly to birds of 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.400
 posture and swine 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.590
 all semi-caipira the case of the birds that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.590
 have not been proud for more than ten years 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.950
 it is perfectly clear the difference 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 egg quality more consistent 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.829
 firm gemma on this property 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.680
 are being tested and planted 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.200
 cana some companies from sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.270
 are nitrogenous the soil with styles 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.240
 prior to the production of organic sugar 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 export type and also to areas of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.229
 take in this second year of planting said 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.020
 squid before big field in the area 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.370
 fruitful production of gum is 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.810
 being much better 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.110
 first managed to fix 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.920
 biologically up to 180 kilograms of 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.440
 nitrogen per hectare year or 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.040
 eliminated the need for nitrogen 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.320
 local 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.570
 Another interesting question is that this 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.000
 The natural act drowned the plagues that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.850
 could be born in the area by avoiding 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.549
 possibility of using the defensive 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.680
 soil was also much more protected 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.750
 with the existence of organic material 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.350
 here below, for example, we can 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.350
 observe the affixing of organic matter 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.110
 yes that is being written along the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.299
 and you can see that here the land is 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.519
 so enough loose with 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.680
 enough organic matter is precisely 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.499
 because the sheet prior to destinations 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.959
 recomposes quickly and serves as food 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:19.060
 for sun bacteria 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.980
 on the farm west makoto the before field 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.439
 is also being tested in the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.989
 feeding of laying birds of the 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:28.840
 fine type product ground and mixed with 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.079
 the proportion of 10% is being 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.939
 offered the birds daily the owner of the 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.400
 has already noticed that the stylus before 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.000
 powder to open up the appetite of the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.939
 birds 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.030
 the constant breaks decreased and the egg 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.879
 looks and feels better 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.400
 in the points use caua affirms that it solved 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.650
 add the stylus to the diet of the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.919
 birds after having excellent results 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.889
 on his cattle ranch and after listening to 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:59.199
 reports that in Asia the silos before 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:03.430
 is doing very well in 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:06.340
 fish pigs and of course birds like the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.129
 feeling now 11 indigenous 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:15.129
 The difference is that missing here is where the 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:20.650
 pentagon turns out to be very thick gemma 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:22.509
 is well malena study fingers on 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.909
 australia also show that 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:28.000
 styles before they have five to 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:30.639
 ten percent more protein than the alpha 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.019
 twice as much iron and four times as much 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.449
 energy 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.560
 not to mention that to produce alpha 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:41.530
 good land is needed 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.099
 the legume requires nothing 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.009
 in fact it goes well even in weak lands 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:52.239
 and sandy we had the opportunity to 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:55.810
 other countries such as Australia and 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.359
 china and prince show they use 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.310
 also for beef and veal 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.629
 cutting pig farming with a success 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.479
 they are a million and a half hectares 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.120
 planted in northeastern australia 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.019
 now in the case of Chinese India beyond 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 bovine 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.969
 they also make use of the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.519
 explosion before for other categories 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:22.120
 animals and we had the opportunity to 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:24.849
 visit is and as fish like poultry swine 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 sheep and goats 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.719
 so they are using this product 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.470
 there for that purpose 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.830
 huh 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.650
 to feed these animals directly into the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.650
 in which the plant of the animal eating 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.350
 directly in the field or by cutting and 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.240
 giving the animal a trough or else I 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.520
 I have another form that is the one that 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.870
 people call it lippi thousand it is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.050
 the style before in powder 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.150
 the student would be a dry 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.120
 placed in the trough with a 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.130
 protein alternative 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.010
 protein for animal feed 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.230
 straight into the trough and still fish them 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.940
 give the one that wanted that one 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.030
 style before powder for the fish if 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.030
 feed and beyond the triumph says 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.250
 the protein legend of protein content 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.430
 in this powder situation that arrives in the order 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.070
 15% or even more if you get your 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.430
 sheet up to 20% 22 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.610
 you have a greater benefit there 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.870
 in case of using blast before is you 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.290
 has fiber content 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.360
 Do you have pants and magnesium and other 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.500
 constituent that the animal also needs 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.570
 so much that when you feed the animal 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:42.310
 It's when you 're feeding the case. 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:44.320
 of aircraft such as the skin color of the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.400
 silent bird, right? 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.110
 the color of the fine egg is exactly one 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.690
 Explosion-fueled chicken before 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.370
 She has the most yellow skin I've had. 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.390
 opportunity to see if you can verify this 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:00.910
 on canvas in China is her skin is more 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.590
 The more beautiful the yellow one, the 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.400
 even considering the chicken of 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.050
 farm 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.930
 then this is the point of view of 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.760
 already has a better and more 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.669
 we are still thinking about a situation 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.660
 different in the integration with the 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:20.800
 soybean and corn as using 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.760
 explosion before in the phase is for example ne 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.130
 and already thinking about the situation to use in 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.650
 stylish before is not soon after the 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.700
 people reap the soybean people planted styles 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.340
 before 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.140
 How many of them before is in the afternoon together? 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.450
 with corn 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.800
 then we choose corn and the last 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.090
 years continues to grow in the 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.729
 rainy season 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.390
 we took and dried styling and 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.490
 we plant 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.960
 soybeans or corn in our 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.150
 integration with agriculture that we 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.700
 we have here that is strong in the region 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.250
 We think also we already have partners 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.250
 making with cotton is also another 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.830
 culture that exhausts a lot of soil and the 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.620
 also use the explosion in the 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:10.680
 cotton and still without thinking about the other 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:14.310
 fruits like mango as a widow and 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.310
 melon watermelon etc.
