00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.560
 Good morning Good afternoon Good night. 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.080
 Once again welcome to this corner of the guitarist made amends. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.610
 Okay, very good, how to maintain the cleanliness of our guitar? 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.029
 very simple, as you can see I have my guitar, I have my rag, I will not talk 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 A lot of things about how you have to do it, but how to keep your guitar clean. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.279
 It's my turn to clean a lot of guitars here in this store when you come to your place 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.850
 guitar please Adrián you can adapt this guitar! 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.990
 Then I go and adjust it and I find that it has dirt everywhere. How 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.290
 Can I tell people to keep their guitar clean? 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.030
 and so he does not have to pay me and clean his guitar by himself. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
 Very simple a cloth, a cloth. 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.559
 Very good, very simple the biggest problem we have is the strings of the guitar 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 "Adrián is that the ropes do not last me, sell me some ropes that last much longer" 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 It's about first before you touch wash my hands. 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.670
 These hands that look clean are full of crap that during the day we take 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.980
 in the metro we open a door, we touch one thing, another ... it's full of crap and that 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.330
 It is completely harmful to strings of such a ferrous material, such as the strings, 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.410
 what I have to do is wash my hands before touching, I wash my hands, simple, 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.960
 no more laps what do I do before playing? 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.620
 That same, wash my hands. 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.801
 And once I finish playing the guitar to do my mega solo, to feel the most 

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:48.250
 from the poper of the guitarists, I take a cloth and, while you listen to a video 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.280
 like this, a video that tells you how to clean your rope and tell you how to do it, 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.700
 You are doing this to the rope and Allah the rope is already clean. What have we been waiting for? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.910
 Nothing, zero coma. 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:08.270
 How can you see, here the black has been marked, all the crap that the ropes 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.880
 you can put together 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.620
 It is a very easy and simple movement I take the rope, the only thing is to take the rope pass it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.629
 with the cloth and then see if it got dirty or not, that means the crap 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.099
 that remains here, then pass a cloth to the body, above all, what is important here 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.390
 It is what the bridge is. 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.629
 Clean it well because when I hold my hand here when it's time to play I'm filled 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.749
 all this area here, I'm filling it with sweat and all this tends to rust and remains 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:47.890
 a disaster, then it's good to take and try to clean all that area so that it stays 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 cleaner as possible and my guitar lasts longer. 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.099
 The cleaning of the guitar there are people who tell me hey to clean the paint I use 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.939
 some important material, unique in the world, something half weird? 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:08.400
 , not always a damp cloth, wet, not wet dripping but wet, I pass by 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.969
 the body and then pass a dry and clean cloth 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.459
 that's it, solved I have the guitar body clean. 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.909
 The same thing happens here the pins, the pins in the case of the pins, are not 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:38.680
 You've had a touch of sweat but it's always good to clean it. How do I clean them? 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.829
 with a cloth what things not? 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:57.029
 It's already solved that way I have my guitar clean, neat many of the guitarists 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:03.310
 we think and we say is like my girl your girl is dirty, why not? 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.439
 Well, this is the same, very clean, taking care of it like our girl, giving her flowers, 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.040
 postcards, songs, verses loving her giving her affection. 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.140
 Today I got up in love with my girl so what I do is clean my guitar 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.400
 I prepare myself to compose a song and give it to her this afternoon so we end up married and everything.
