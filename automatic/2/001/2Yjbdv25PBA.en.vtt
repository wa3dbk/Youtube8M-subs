00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
basically just the brushes that I think

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.220 
basically just the brushes that I think
are<00:00:14.580> absolutely<00:00:15.020> fundamental<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
are absolutely fundamental for a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.570 
are absolutely fundamental for a
starting<00:00:16.560> point<00:00:16.740> if<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.220> want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> get

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
starting point if you want to get

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.189 
starting point if you want to get
started<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.119> makeup<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.690> start<00:00:19.020> just

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
started in makeup and start just

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
started in makeup and start just
advancing<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> skills<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.220> little<00:00:20.699> bit<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
advancing the skills a little bit I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.340 
advancing the skills a little bit I
thought<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> would<00:00:21.600> start<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:21.930> makeup

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
thought I would start with makeup

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.679 
thought I would start with makeup
brushes<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.400> opinion<00:00:23.550> those<00:00:24.390> are

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
brushes because in my opinion those are

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.509 
brushes because in my opinion those are
the<00:00:24.720> absolute<00:00:25.289> most<00:00:25.410> important<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.250> that

brushes<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.570> most<00:00:42.719> important<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.320> that's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
brushes the most important so that's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.930 
brushes the most important so that's
where<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> thought<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> would<00:00:44.100> start<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
where I thought I would start from I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
where I thought I would start from I
really<00:00:45.539> only<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.870> four<00:00:46.320> brushes<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
really only have four brushes that I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
really only have four brushes that I
think<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.190> absolutely<00:00:47.329> fundamental<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
think are absolutely fundamental and I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.240 
think are absolutely fundamental and I
think<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.020> see<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.440> quite<00:00:50.190> a

think that will see you through quite a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
think that will see you through quite a
lot<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> makeup<00:00:50.820> looks<00:00:51.059> until<00:00:51.449> you're<00:00:51.600> able<00:00:51.750> to
